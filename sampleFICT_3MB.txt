the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its course not a day passed by that the world was not the better because this man humble as he was had lived he never stepped aside from his own path yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor almost involuntarily too he of his thought which as one of its manifestations took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his hand flowed also forth in speech he uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him his auditors it may be never suspected that ernest their own neighbor and familiar friend was more than an ordinary man least of all did ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken when the people s minds had had a little time to cool they were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between general blood and thunder s truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain side but now again there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers affirming that the likeness of the great stone face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old blood and thunder was in his early days and taken up the trades of law and politics instead of the rich man s wealth and the warrior s sword he had but a tongue and it was mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent was he that whatever he might choose to say his auditors had no choice but to believe him wrong looked like right and right like wrong for when it pleased him he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it his tongue indeed was a magic instrument sometimes it rumbled like the thunder sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music it was the blast of war the song of peace and it seemed to have a heart in it when there was no such matter in good truth he was a wondrous man and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable success when it had been heard in halls of state and in made him known all over the world even as a voice crying from shore to shore it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the presidency before this time indeed as soon as he began to grow celebrated his admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the great stone face and so much were they struck by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of old stony phiz the phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects for as is likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever becomes president without taking a name other than his own while his friends were doing their best to make him president old stony phiz as he was called set out on a visit to the valley where he was born of course he had no other object than to shake hands with his fellow citizens and neither thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might have the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the state and all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass among these was ernest though more than once disappointed as we have seen he had such a hopeful and confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful and good he kept his heart continually open and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he went forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face the cavalcade came prancing along the road with a great clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust which rose up so dense and high that
ruth answered a sweet bird like voice which pierced poor rex s heart to the very core as a girlish little figure bounded through the open door way out into the brilliant sunshine god pity me cried rex staggering forward it is daisy my wife chapter xiii rex had hoped against hope daisy he cried holding out his arms to her with a yearning passionate cry my god tell me it is false you are not here with stanwick or i shall go mad daisy my dear little sweetheart my little love why do nt you speak he cried clasping her close to his heart rapturous kisses daisy struggled out of his embrace with a low broken sob flinging herself on her knees at his feet with a sharp cry daisy said the old lady bending over her and smoothing back the golden hair from the lovely anguished face tell him the truth dear you are here with mr stanwick is it not so the sudden weight of sorrow that had fallen upon poor hapless daisy seemed to paralyze her very senses the sunshine seemed blotted out and the light of heaven to grow dark around her yes she cried despairingly and it almost seemed to daisy another voice had spoken with her lips this mr stanwick claims to be your husband asked the old lady solemnly yes she cried out again in agony but rex i i the words died away on her white lips and the sound died away in a look of white frozen horror on his face which gave place to stern bitter wrath slowly and sadly he put her clinging arms away from him folding his arms across his breast with that terrible look upon his face such as a hero s face wears when he has heard unflinchingly his death sentence the calm of terrible despair daisy he said proudly i have trusted you blindly for i loved you madly passionately i would as soon believe the fair smiling heavens that bend above us false as you whom i loved so madly and so well i was mad to bind you with such cruel irksome bonds when your heart was not mine but another s my dream of love is shattered now you have broken my heart and ruined and blighted my life god forgive you daisy for i never can i give you back your freedom i release you from your vows i can not curse you i you from my heart as i cast you from my life farewell daisy farewell forever she tried to speak but her tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth oh pitying heaven if she could only have cried out to you and the angels to bear witness and proclaim her innocence the strength to move hand or foot seemed suddenly to have left her she tried hard oh so hard to speak but no sound issued from her white lips she felt as one in a horrible trance fearfully terribly conscious of all that transpired around her yet denied the power to move even a muscle to defend herself have you anything to say to me daisy he asked mournfully turning from her to depart the woful terrified gaze of the blue eyes deepened pitifully but she spoke no word and rex turned from her turned from the girl bride whom he loved so madly with a bursting broken left her alone with the pitying sunlight falling upon her golden hair and her white face turned up to heaven silently praying to god that she might die then and there oh father above pity her she had no mother s gentle voice to guide her no father s strong breast to weep upon no sister s soothing presence she was so young and so pitifully lonely and rex had drifted out of her life forever believing her oh bitterest of thoughts believing her false and sinful poor little daisy was ignorant of the ways of the world but a dim realization of the full import of the terrible accusation brought against her forced its way to her troubled brain she only realized rex her darling rex had gone out of her life forever daisy flung herself face downward in the long cool waving green grass where rex had left her daisy called miss burton softly it is all over but she turned from her with a shuddering gasp in the name of pity leave me to myself she sobbed it is the greatest kindness you can do me and the poor old lady who had wrought so much sorrow unwittingly in those two severed lives walked slowly back to the cottage with tears in her eyes strongly impressed there must be some dark mystery in the young girl s life who was sobbing her heart out in the green grass yonder and she did just what almost any other person would have done under the same circumstances sent immediately for lester stanwick he answered the summons at once listening with intense interest while the aged spinster briefly related all that had transpired but through oversight or excitement she quite forgot to mention rex had called daisy his wife curse him he muttered under his breath i i believe the girl actually cares for him then he went out to daisy lying so poor daisy poor desperate lonely struggling child all this cruel load of sorrow crushing her girlish heart and blighting her young life and she so innocent so entirely blameless yet such a plaything of fate daisy he said bending over her and lifting the slight form in his arms they tell me some one has been troubling you who has dared annoy you trust in me daisy what is the matter lester stanwick never forgot the white pitiful face that was raised to his i want to die she sobbed oh why did you not leave me to die in the dark water
wanted in it he said he must try her some time in made mela repeat them could only mean that he admired her more than anybody else he came fitfully but he came often and she rested content in a girl s indefiniteness concerning the affair if her thought went beyond lovemaking to marriage she believed that she could have him if she wanted him her father s money counted in this she divined that beaton was poor but that made no difference she would have enough for both the money would have counted as an irresistible attraction if there had been no other the affair had gone on in spite of the sidelong looks of restless dislike with which dryfoos regarded it but now when beaton did not come to saratoga it necessarily dropped and christine s content with it she bore the trial as long as she could she used pride and resentment against it but at last she could not bear it and with mela s help she wrote a letter bantering beaton on his stay in new york and that it was a very bright letter and would be sure to bring him they would have had no scruple about sending it but for the doubt they had whether they had got some of the words right mela offered to bet christine anything she dared that they were right and she said send it anyway it was no difference if they were wrong but christine could not endure to think of that laugh of beaton s and there remained only mrs mandel as authority on the spelling christine dreaded her authority on other points but mela said she knew she would not interfere and she undertook to get round her mrs mandel pronounced the spelling bad and the taste worse she forbade them to send the letter and mela failed to get round her though she threatened if mrs mandel would not tell her how to spell the wrong words that she would send the letter as it was then mrs mandel said that if mr beaton appeared in saratoga she this result christine accused her of having mismanaged the whole business she quarrelled with her and they called each other names christine declared that she would not stay in saratoga and that if mrs mandel did not go back to new york with her she should go alone they returned the first week in september but by that time beaton had gone to see his people in syracuse conrad dryfoos remained at home with his mother after his father went west he had already taken such a vacation as he had been willing to allow himself and had spent it on a charity farm near the city where the fathers with whom he worked among the poor on the east side in the winter had sent some of their wards for the summer it was not possible to keep his recreation a secret at the office and fulkerson found a pleasure in figuring the jolly time brother conrad must have teaching farm work among those paupers and potential reprobates he invented details of his experience among them laugh at conrad s humorless helplessness under fulkerson s burlesque denunciation of a summer outing spent in such dissipation they had time for a great deal of joking at the office during the season of leisure which penetrates in august to the very heart of business and they all got on terms of greater intimacy if not greater friendliness than before fulkerson had not had so long to do with the advertising side of human nature without developing a vein of cynicism of no great depth perhaps but broad and underlying his whole point of view he made light of beaton s solemnity as he made light of conrad s humanity the art editor with abundant sarcasm had no more humor than the publisher and was an easy prey in the manager s hands but when he had been led on by fulkerson s flatteries to make some betrayal of egotism he brooded over it till he had thought how to revenge himself in elaborate insult for beaton s talent fulkerson never lost his admiration himself airs of being the sole source of the magazine s prosperity no bait of this sort was too obvious for beaton to swallow he could be caught with it as often as fulkerson chose though he was ordinarily suspicious as to the motives of people in saying things with march he got on no better than at first he seemed to be lying in wait for some encroachment of the literary department on the art department and he met it now and then with anticipative reprisal after these rebuffs the editor delivered him over to the manager who could turn beaton s contrary mindedness to account by asking the reverse of what he really wanted done this was what fulkerson said the fact was that he did get on with beaton and march contented himself with musing upon the contradictions of a character at once so vain and so offensive so fickle and so sullen so conscious and so simple after the first jarring contact with dryfoos the editor ceased to feel the disagreeable fact of none of the chances which might have made it painful occurred the control of the whole affair remained in fulkerson s hands before he went west again dryfoos had ceased to come about the office as if having once worn off the novelty of the sense of owning a literary periodical he was no longer interested in it yet it was a relief somehow when he left town which he did not do without coming to take a formal leave of the editor at his office he seemed willing to leave march with a better impression than he had hitherto troubled himself to make he even said some civil things about the magazine as if its
in a way ah well you have your girlish dreams of love and it is right that you should have them and it would be very wrong to destroy them but they shall not be destroyed by me and surely not by any other man while i live i shall grow young again i will grow young for you for in years at least i am not vjera and i will love as boys love but with the strength of a man who has known sorrow and overlived it you shall not feel that in taking me you are taking a father a protector a man to whom your youth seems childhood and your youthfulness childish folly no no i will be more than that to you i will be all to you that you are to me and more and more each day till love has made us of one age of one mind of one heart do you not believe that all this shall be speak dear what is there yet behind in your thoughts i can not tell i wish i knew vjera s answer was scarcely audible and she turned her face from him and yet there is something you are keeping something from me when i have kept nothing from you why is it why do you not quite trust me and now yesterday it was different and so it was in all the yesterdays of yesterdays i had nothing to offer you but myself it were best so said vjera in a low voice the count was silent there was something in her manner which he could not understand or rather as he fancied there was something in his own brain which prevented him from understanding a very simple matter and he grew impatient with himself at the same time he felt more and more strongly drawn to the young girl at his side as the sun went down and the evening shadows deepened he saw more in her face than he had been accustomed to see there every line of the pale features so familiar to his sight in his everyday life reminded him of moments in the recent past when he had been wretchedly unhappy and when the kindly look in vjera s face had comforted him and made life seem less unbearable in his dreary world she alone had were insulted or respected were treated like a dog or like a christian man the kindness of his employer was indeed undeniable but it was of the sort which grated upon the sensitive nature of the unfortunate cigarette maker for it was in itself vulgarly cheerful assuming that after all the count should be contented with his lot but vjera had always seemed to understand him to feel for him to foresee his sensibilities as it were and to be prepared for them in a measure appreciable to himself she admired him and admiration alone can make pity palatable to the proud in her eyes his constancy under misfortune was as admirable as his misfortunes themselves were worthy of commiseration in her eyes he was a gentleman and one who had a right to hold his head high among the best when he was poorest he had felt himself to be in her eyes a hero are there many men who can resist the charm of the one woman who believes them to really better for the trust and faith that is placed in them by others as the earthen vessel valueless in itself becomes a thing of prize and beauty under the loving hand of the artist who draws graceful figures upon it and colours it skilfully and handles it tenderly and now the poor man was puzzled and made anxious by the girl s obstinate rejection of his offer a chilly thought took shape in his mind and pained him exceedingly vjera he said at last i see how it is you have never loved me you have only pitied me you are good and kind vjera but i wish it had been otherwise he spoke very quietly in a subdued tone and the moisture which had been more than once in his eyes since he had sat down beside the young girl now almost took the shape of a tear he was wounded in his innocent vanity in the last stronghold of his fast fading individuality but illuminated her pale blue eyes and dispelled the misty veil that seemed to dull them whatever you say do not say that she exclaimed i love you with all my heart i ah if you only understood if you only knew if you only guessed that is it answered the count if i only could but there is something that passes my understanding the look of pain faded from his face and gave way to a bright smile so bright so rare that it restored in the magic of an instant the freshness of early youth to the weary mask of sorrow then he covered his eyes with his hands as though searching his memory for something he could not find what is it he asked after a short pause and looking suddenly at vjera it is something i ought to remember and yet something i have quite forgotten help me vjera tell me what you are thinking of and thinking of this day a week ago said vjera and a little sob escaped her as she quickly looked away a week ago let me see what happened a week ago but why should i ask nothing ever happens to me nothing until now and now oh vjera it is you who do not understand it is you who do not know who can not guess as if he had forgotten everything else in the sudden realisation of his return to liberty and fortune he began to speak quickly and excitedly in a tone louder and clearer than that of his ordinary
the center on either side two parties are then formed and each chooses is then thrown up half way between the bounds and the game begins the contestants contending with their bats for the ball as it falls when one succeeds in getting it fairly into the pocket of his bat he swings it aloft and throws it as far as he can toward the bound to which his party is working taking care to send it if possible where some of his own side will take it up thus the ball is thrown and contended for till one party succeeds in casting it beyond the bounds of the opposite party a hundred players on a side

it in a gory way as the south sea islanders treated their foes his should be treated he would go upon the war path and as for alf well he was sorry for dead within his breast specifically he remembered something in the reader die spawn of our kindred die traitor to lara as he spake there was blood on the spear of mudara there must be blood and he laid his plans with what he considered the very height of savage craft and ingenuity the father of alf was a sturdy man and good one but he had a weakness he was the chief supporter in the neighborhood of the itinerant minister who exhorted throughout this portion of the country and he had imbibed perhaps too much of a fancy for hearing himself talk at revival meetings and for hearing himself in long prayers at home his petitions covered a great range of subjects and he was regular in their presentation the family prayers before breakfast every morning were serious matters to the boys from one point of view and not as serious as they should have been from another present and kneeling at chairs about the the order was imperative and the father s arm was strong and above the door hung a strap of no light weight constituting as it had once done that portion of a horse s harness known technically as the bellyband so the boys were always there each at his particular chair and grant harlson who had been present at these orisons many a time knew exactly where alf s chair was and the attitude he must occupy it was close beside an open window and his back was always toward the opening this particular attitude having been dictated by the father in the vain hope of making his buoyant offspring more attentive if their gaze were diverted from things outside and all these circumstances the dreadful savage from the south sea islands was considering with care they are very regular in their habits in the country and he knew just the moment when the morning devotions would begin some fifteen minutes before the breakfast hour he knew about how long he would be in traversing the coming tragedy and the morning after his resolve was made he bolted his own breakfast in a hurry seized his spear and scurried down the wood road until he approached the verge of the maitland clearing then began a series of extraordinary movements mr maitland s house stood close by the wood at one side of the clearing and grant could easily have walked unperceived until within a few yards of the place had he but kept hidden by the trees but such was not his course right across the clearing and passing near the house had been dug a great ditch a yard in depth a year or two before with the intent of draining a piece of lowland lately subjugated this ditch had been overgrown with weeds until it was almost hidden from sight and now in summer time its bottom was but a sandy surface it was with the aid of this natural shelter that the wily invader proposed to steal upon his enemy already he was lurking near its entrance this particular juncture grant could not probably have told there was not the slightest necessity for lurking there were no windows in the side of the house toward him and no one was visible about the place but he knew what he had read and he knew that the savages of the south sea islands were always addicted to lurking just previous to springing upon their unsuspecting victims and he was bound to lurk and do it thoroughly his manner of lurking consisted before he reached the clearing fence in crouching very low and creeping along in a most constrained and uncomfortable manner occasionally dropping to the ground slowly and with utter noiselessness and rising again with equal caution all this time the face of the young man wore what he conceived to be an expression of most bloody purpose craftily concealed upon reaching the fence he shot his head above it and withdrew it with lightning like rapidity frightening almost into convulsions in her nest a robin whose home was between the rails in through the fence with greater ease but that would have involved no such dramatic effect his sudden view of the landscape taken the boy climbed the fence ran to the dry ditch parted the overhanging weeds and leaped down once in the dry waterway he was utterly concealed from view even had any one been near but that made no difference with his precautions he knew that after savages had lurked they always glided and that what the writers describe as a snake like motion was something absolutely essential spear in hand and creeping on his hands and knees the destroyer advanced along the drain lying flat and wriggling with much patience wherever a particularly clear stretch of sand presented itself half way across the field he raised his head with a movement so slow that a full minute was occupied in the performance parted the weeds gently and peered out to get his bearings and ascertain if any foemen were in sight there were no foemen and his progress had made with no less adroitness and success at last there fell upon the ear of the avenger the sound of a human voice he was close to the house and the morning exercises had begun here was the moment for the exhibition of all south sea island craft and the moment was about at hand too for exhibition of the full measure of a south sea islander s ferocity the islander glided from the ditch crept to the house and slowly put forth his head until he could see around the corner there within three feet of him back to the window kneeling beside his chair
and this killing as it did one of the oldest and best known of the miners had created an intense excitement in the little town immediately following the explosion there had been put in circulation a report of the accident so exaggerated that it had brought to the spot the wives of half the miners in the camp each one of whom was confident that her husband was among the twenty or more men said to have been killed it had been this hasty gathering which had caught grant s eye and the everetts and allie had hurried down into the town just in time to learn the truth that but one man they slowly dispersed so noisy in their joy that their own friends had escaped that they forgot to give more than a passing thought to poor careless mike whose working days were ended but that came later and among all his mourners there were none more sincere than the little group at the everetts who knew and appreciated the real worth of the jovial brawny irishman whose pleasant word and helping hand were extended to all with whom he ever came in contact they were still talking of him when the bell rang and a moment later wang kum ushered dr brownlee into the parlor at sight of him marjorie sprang up impulsively oh doctor tell us about the poor boy how is he she asked abruptly without waiting for any formal greeting if you mean the one who was hurt at the mine this afternoon the doctor was beginning when ned hastily interposed hold on a minute chair there s something wrong about the stuff it s covered with tis nt real leather and it melts and gets sticky in summer or when there s a hot fire you d better steer clear of it we mean to keep it out of the way you might use it for a trap suggested the doctor laughingly as he pushed aside the great easy chair and settled himself in a willow rocker then his face grew grave again as he turned back to marjorie he s as badly hurt as he can be he went on he ll get over it but he ll never be able to do anything more he has nt come to his senses yet and i wish he need nt for the present for he has a hard time before him he added as he rose to meet louise who came into the room just then i m a little upset to night about the coldness of his hand to be perfectly honest this is my first accident case and it s a very different thing from seeing people quietly ill in bed even if you know they ca nt get well i was at the house when they brought him in and i hope i sha nt often have to go through such a scene again tell me about it said louise with a gentle sympathy which lent a new grace to her beauty i m not afraid to hear and perhaps i can do something for them by and by and the doctor told forgetting himself and even the charming young woman before him as he went on with the story of the mother s frantic sorrow over her only son of the boy s half conscious suffering and of the long helpless life before him the girl s eyes filled with tears as she listened though her pity for the lad was mingled with a new entirely in the mere words describing the accident but under all that it told of the generous kindly sympathy of the true doctor who shrinks from the sight of pain even while he gives his life to watching and helping it two weeks later marjorie was spending a stormy afternoon at the burnams when ned appeared on the piazza hullo he exclaimed as he furled his dripping umbrella and shook himself out of his rubber coat you d better believe i m wet lou went off before it rained and i had to pack her rubbers and umbrella over to her it s no joke to walk a mile in such a pour where is she asked allie while she hospitably drew up a chair for her guest over the creek with that boy of hers she puts in ever so much time there since he s better she says he s crazy to read and be read to responded ned as he wriggled away from the too exuberant caresses of ben how is he getting on inquired marjorie all right as much as he can lou says he s bright and knows a good deal how kind she s been to him said allie thoughtfully and charlie too he buys lots of things for him and sends them over by dr brownlee good for charlie mac that s just like him said ned enthusiastically where is he anyhow we supposed he was over at your house with grant answered howard from the corner where he sat industriously whittling at a set of small wooden pegs it must be nice to have money and do all sorts of things like that sighed marjorie i ca nt afford to buy books and fruit for i m always short on my allowance and mamma wo nt let me give i ca nt do what miss lou does poor marj it s a hard case for time s money and you have nt any of either remarked howard wait a minute she answered starting from her chair and pacing up and down the room as was her habit when much absorbed i m getting hold of an idea hold on then and do nt let it go advised ned dodging the sofa pillow that marjorie hurled at him listen she commanded imperatively it s really and truly a good plan you know we have nt any too
as most of the others the furniture being of satin wood and ivory and the hangings and drapings of the bed and windows of pink velvet and white lace two curiously wrought silver lamps stood on the dressing table and showed that they had burned themselves casket it was open and showed rings and aigrettes of diamonds and emeralds a few ruby ornaments lay on the table and a string of pearls also a small lace scarf and a pair of lady s gloves embroidered on the backs with gold the curtains and velvet draperies of the windows were completely closed and the room looked as though some one had dressed in it and gone away and left the lamps burning everything was a mystery to the ladies which they could not unravel when the day was over mrs carleton and miss vyvyan sat beside the sleeping child in mrs carleton s room the fire was burning on the hearth and the full moon poured its beams in at the windows they had no other light mrs carleton spoke much of her bereavement but struggled to be brave and to resign herself to a destiny she could not alter at the same time revealing quite unawares to herself a character full of intense affection unselfishness pure face so full of emotion and sensibility and the firelight flickered upon and lit up the refined features her whole heart yearned toward her new friend and her own sorrow was buried in those of the forlorn young mother i have been considering said miss vyvyan about your child do you not think we ought to make life as bright and happy as we can for her and we can do a great deal although we may have to stay in exile for a long while she need never suffer from that idea all will depend upon the way we educate her and the way we live exactly so replied mrs carleton we will make our lives as good an example as possible we will bring her up as far as circumstances will admit the same as we would do if she were in my old home we can not have the servants we have been accustomed to have but we can make and we must make it a cheerful one for her sake there is one thing i feel very anxious about said mrs carleton my child has not yet been baptized as i told you we were going to take her to england for that purpose i should feel happier if i could carry out my husband s wish and be able to call her by the name he so much liked i can fully enter into your feelings said miss vyvyan why not baptize her yourself i presume you are familiar with the service as we have baptisms in our church so frequently yes replied mrs carleton and i can not see that there would be anything wrong in doing so myself as there is not any one else to do it it can no more be wrong said anna to repeat the baptismal prayers for your child than it is to offer it seems perfectly right as we are situated at present i am glad you entertain those feelings on the subject miss vyvyan replied mrs carleton and as we are both of the english church will you be godmother to my little one you confer great happiness on me replied anna by making such a request what do you intend to call her cora was the name my husband wished her to be called replied mrs carleton and i desire to add caroline to it as that is the name of my dear mother and is now alas the only means i have of showing my affection for her who is perhaps at this moment mourning my absence will you baptize her to morrow inquired miss vyvyan if you will we can make a dress for her in the forenoon there is an abundance of white india muslin and cashmere too enough yes answered mrs carleton i like that idea and we will keep her always dressed in white and as to yourself said anna i ask you as a favor to let me choose for you in this instance i wish you always to be beautifully dressed in colors that will look bright and cheerful i think it will have an influence on the child s spirits and thence on her health i do not feel that we need to have any compunction about using the things we find here for we see that this place must have been deserted many years ago and i can not help thinking that all these costly things are the plunder of buccaneers nothing is so probable answered mrs carleton indeed when we consider for a moment everything seems to say so many of those cases which still remain unopened are such as the merchants bring to the colony of virginia i have it occurs to me that all these stores are the cargoes of ships that have been robbed by those desperate men who have been and still are the terror of the sea but why they left this place so suddenly is difficult to divine unless perhaps retribution fell upon them when they were out at sea on some of their marauding expeditions evidently a lady has lived here too perhaps they took her with them on their last voyage and she also may have been lost so i think we may feel we are not doing wrong in using such things as are necessary to our existence while we are here the next morning the ladies were up early busying themselves with their preparations for the child s baptism as they sat by the open window in the green parlor making the little white dress the sunlight falling upon the floor the soft warm breeze from the south coming
blazing pyramidal invitation when the doors were burst in he paused a moment to see if mahommed were coming the hordes are here o princess but not the sultan she raised her veil and regarded him silently i see now but one resort as mirza the emir i must meet the pillagers by claiming the sultan sent me in we are at mercy count corti she replied heaven deal with you as you deal with us if the ruse fails princess i can die for you now tie yourselves as before two and two hand to hand it may be they will call on me to distinguish such as are my charge she cast a glance of pity about her and these count these poor women not of my house and the children can you not save them also alas dear lady the blessed mother must be their shield while the veils were being applied the surge against the railing took place leaving a number of dead and fainting across it hadifah the count called out clear the way to yon chair against the wall the sheik set about removing the persons blockading the space and greatly affected by their condition the princess interceded for them not to their terror i pray but the count was a soldier in case of an affray he wanted the advantage of a wall at his back dear lady it was the throne of your fathers now yours i will seat you there from it you can best treat with the lord mahommed ere long some of the hordes half a dozen or more came to the chancel gate they were of the rudest class of anatolian shepherds clad principally in half cloaks of shaggy goat skin each bore at his back a round buckler a bow and a clumsy quiver of feathered arrows awed by the splendor of the altar and its surroundings they stopped then with shouts they rushed at the tempting display unmindful of the living spoils crouched on the floor dumb with terror others of a like kind reenforced them and there was a fierce scramble the latest comers turned to the women and presently discovered the princess than the rest was indisposed to respect the berbers here are slaves worth having get your ropes he shouted to his companions the count interposed art thou a believer he asked in turkish they surveyed him doubtfully and then turned to hadifah and his men tall imperturbable looking their dark faces visible through their open hoods of steel they looked at their shields also and at their bare cimeters resting points to the floor why do you ask the man returned because as thou mayst see we also are of the faithful and do not wish harm to any whose mothers have taught them to begin the day with the fah hat the fellow was impressed who art thou i am the emir mirza of the household of our lord the padishah to whom be all the promises of the koran these are slaves i selected for him all these thou seest in bonds will be here directly he is now coming a man wearing a bloody tarbousche joined the pillagers during this colloquy and pressing in heard the emir s name passing from mouth to mouth the emir mirza i knew him brethren he commanded the caravan and kept the mahmals the year i made the pilgrimage stand off and let me see after a short inspection he continued truly as there is no god but god this is he i was next him at the most holy corner of the kaaba when he fell down struck by the plague i saw him kiss the black stone and by virtue of the kiss he lived ay stand back or if you touch him or one of these in his charge and escape his hand ye shall not escape the padishah whose first sword he is even as khalid was first sword for the prophet exalted be his name give kissed the count s hand arise o son of thy father said corti and when our master the lord mahommed hath set up his court and harem seek me for reward the man stayed awhile although there was no further show of interference and he looked past the princess to lael cowering near her he took no interest in what was going on around him lael alone attracted him at last he shifted his sheepskin covering higher upon his shoulders and left these words with the count the women are not for the harem i understand thee o mirza when the lord mahommed hath set up his court do thou tell the little jewess yonder that her father the prince of india charged thee to give her his undying love count corti was wonder struck he could not speak and so the wandering jew vanished from his sight as he now vanishes from our story the selection among the other refugees in such as were considered not worth the having a long time passed during which the princess irene sat with veil drawn close trying to shut out the horror of the scene her attendants clinging to the throne and to each other seemed a heap of dead women at last a crash of music was heard in the vestibule drums cymbals and trumpets in blatant flourish four runners slender lads in short sleeveless jackets over white shirts and wide trousers of yellow silk barefooted and bareheaded stepped lightly through the central doorway and waving wands tipped with silver balls cried in long toned shrill iteration the lord mahommed mahommed sultan of sultans the spoilsmen suspended their hideous labor the victims moved doubtless by a hope of rescue gave over their lamentations and struggling only the young children and the wounded and suffering persisted in vexing the floor and galleries next to enter were the five official heralds halting thousands of eyes
tells them that it s a round globe like a ball or an orange do nt be impolite the less they know about the old world the better they get on i dare say your colossal fund of worldly knowledge does nt seem to make you very happy just now how could you lose your money i ask you re nothing but a student and you are not in any business are you yes is too what do you mean i mean that i ve been winding myself up into a hard knot the last six months and the more i try to disentangle myself the worse the thing gets my allowance is nt half enough nobody but a miser could live on it i ve been unlucky too i bought a dog and some one poisoned him before i could sell him then i lamed a horse from the livery stable and had to pay damages and so it went the fellows all kept lending me money rather than let me stay out of the little club suppers and since i ve shut down on expensive gayeties they ve gone back on me and all want their money at once so does the livery stable keeper and the owner of the dog and a dozen other individuals in fact the debtors prison yawns before me upon my word i considerable heat to waste money in that way when you knew perfectly well you could nt afford it was well it was downright dishonest that s what it was to hear you talk about dogs and lame horses and club suppers anybody would suppose you were a sporting man pray what else do they do in that charming college set of yours i might have known you would take that tone but i did nt somehow i told you just because i thought you were the one girl in a thousand who would understand and advise a fellow when he knows he s made a fool of himself and acted like a cur i did nt suppose you would call hard names and be so unsympathizing after all we have gone through together i m not i did nt i wo nt do it again said polly incoherently as she took a straight chair planted her elbows on the table now let s talk about it tell me everything quickly how much is it nearly two hundred dollars do nt shudder so provokingly polly that s a mere bagatelle for a college man but i know it s a good deal for me a good deal more than i know how to get at all events where is the debtors prison asked polly in an awestruck whisper oh there is nt any such thing nowadays i was only chaffing but of course the men to whom i am in debt can apply to father and get me in a regular mess i ve pawned my watch to stave one of them off you see polly i would rather die than do it nevertheless i would write and tell father everything and ask him for the money but circumstances conspire just at this time to make it impossible you know he bought that great ranch in ventura died insolvent and father has to make certain payments or lose control of a valuable property it s going to make him a rich man some time but for a year or two we shall have to count every penny of course the fruit crop this season has been the worst in ten years and of course there has been a frost this winter the only severe one within the memory of the oldest inhabitant that s the way it always is and there i am i suppose you despise me polly yes i do hotly no i do nt altogether and i m not good enough myself to be able to despise people besides you are not a despisable boy you were born manly and generous and true hearted and these hateful things that you have been doing are not a part of your nature a bit but i m ashamed of you for yielding to bad impulses when you have so very same thing myself now that i stop to think about it but how could you you edgar noble take that evil eyed fat nosed common tony selling for a friend i wonder at you he is nt so bad in some ways i owe him eighty dollars of that money and he says he ll give me six months to pay it i m glad he has some small virtues polly replied witheringly now what can we do edgar let us think what can what can we do and she leaned forward reflectively clasping her knee with her hands and wrinkling her brow with intense thought that little we fell on edgar s loneliness of spirit consolingly for it adds a new pang to self distrust when righteous people withdraw from one in utter disdain even if they are only girls who know little of a boy s temptations if you can save something said polly finally with a brighter look i can spare fifty or even seventy five dollars of our money and you may pay it back as you can we are not likely to need it for several months and your father and mother ought not to be troubled with this matter now that it s over and done with the blood rushed to edgar s face as he replied stiffly i may be selfish and recklessly extravagant but i do nt borrow money from girls if you wanted to add the last touch to my shame you ve done it do nt you suppose i have eyes polly oliver do nt you suppose i ve hated myself ever since i came under this roof when i have seen the way you worked and planned and plotted
on the sick flowers and then again instantly on the wing the plants around feel the too potent fervours the tall maize rolls up its long green leaves the clover droops its tender foliage and declines its blooms but far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills with all their growth of woods silent and stern as if the scorching heat and dazzling light were but an element they loved bright clouds motionless pillars of the brazen heaven their bases on the mountains their white tops shining in the far ether fire the air with a reflected radiance and make turn the gazer s eye away for me i lie languidly in the shade where the thick turf yet virgin from the kisses of the sun retains some freshness and i woo the wind that still delays its coming why so slow gentle and voluble spirit of the air oh come and breathe that in his caves he hears me see on yonder woody ridge the pine is bending his proud top and now among the nearer groves chestnut and oak are tossing their green boughs about he comes lo where the grassy meadow runs in waves the deep distressful silence of the scene breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds and universal motion he is come shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs and bearing on their fragrance and he brings music of birds and rustling of young boughs and sound of swaying branches and the voice of distant waterfalls all the green herbs are stirring in his breath a thousand flowers by the road side and the borders of the brook nod gayly to each other glossy leaves are twinkling in the sun as if the dew were on them yet and silver waters break into small waves and sparkle as he comes an indian at the burial place of his fathers it is the spot i came from these vales ashamed and weak withdrew our wasted race it is the spot i know it well of which our old traditions tell for here the upland bank sends out a ridge toward the river side i know the shaggy hills about the meadows smooth and wide the plains that toward the southern sky fenced east and west by mountains lie a white man gazing on the scene would say a lovely spot was here and praise the lawns so fresh and green between the hills so sheer i like it not i would the plain lay in its tall old groves again the sheep are on the slopes around the cattle in the meadows feed and labourers turn the crumbling ground or drop the yellow seed and prancing steeds in trappings gay whirl the bright chariot o er the way methinks it were a nobler sight to see these vales in woods arrayed their summits in the golden light their trunks in grateful shade and prostrate trees below and then to mark the lord of all the forest hero trained to wars quivered and plumed and lithe and tall and seamed with glorious scars walk forth amid his reign to dare the wolf and grapple with the bear this bank in which the dead were laid was sacred when its soil was ours hither the artless indian maid brought wreaths of beads and flowers and the gray chief and gifted seer worshipped the god of thunders here but now the wheat is green and high on clods that hid the warrior s breast and scattered in the furrows lie the weapons of his rest and there in the loose sand is thrown of his large arm the mouldering bone ah little thought the strong and brave who bore their lifeless chieftain forth or the young wife that weeping gave her first born to the earth that the pale race who waste us now among their bones should guide the plough we shrink away and fast they follow as we go towards the setting day till they shall fill the land and we are driven into the western sea but i behold a fearful sign to which the white men s eyes are blind their race may vanish hence like mine and leave no trace behind save ruins o er the region spread and the white stones above the dead before these fields were shorn and tilled full to the brim our rivers flowed the melody of waters filled the fresh and boundless wood and torrents dashed and rivulets played and fountains spouted in the shade those grateful sounds are heard no more the springs are silent in the sun the rivers by the blackened shore with lessening current run the realm our tribes are crushed to get may be a barren desert yet song dost thou idly ask to hear at what gentle seasons nymphs relent when lovers near press the tenderest reasons ah wooer maidens hearts are always soft would that men s were truer woo the fair one when around early birds are singing when o er all the fragrant ground early herbs are springing when the brookside bank and grove all with blossoms laden shine with beauty breathe of love woo the timid maiden woo her when with rosy blush summer eve is sinking when on rills that softly gush stars are softly winking when through boughs that knit the bower moonlight gleams are stealing woo her till the gentle hour wake a gentler feeling woo her when autumnal dyes tinge the woody mountain when the dropping foliage lies in the weedy fountain let the scene that tells how fast youth is passing over warn her ere her bloom is past to secure her lover woo her when the north winds call at the lattice nightly when within the cheerful hall blaze the landscape hoary sweeter in her ear shall sound love s delightful story hymn of the waldenses hear father hear thy faint afflicted flock cry to thee from the desert and the

under all other sounds of life but steadily and with sweet monotony the world of little living things in grass and thicket made itself heard the dewy darkness was a pleasure to angelique but peggy moved restlessly and finally clasped her hands behind her neck and leaned against the window side watching as well as she could the queen of hearts opposite she could herself feel angelique s charm of beautiful health and outreaching sympathy peggy was a candid girl and had no self deceptions but she did have that foreknowledge of herself which lives a germ in some unformed girls whose development surprises everybody she knew she could become a woman of strength and influence the best wife in the territory for an ambitious man who had the wisdom to choose her her sharp fairness would round out moreover and her red head melting the snows which fell in middle age crown at an age when angelique would be faded peggy s richest bloom would appear she was like the wild grapes under the bluffs it required frost to ripen her but women whom nature thus obliges to wait for beauty seldom do it graciously transition is not repose well which is it to be rice jones or pierre menard be candid with me angelique as i would be with you you know you will have to decide some time i do not think monsieur reece zhone is for me said angelique with intuitive avoidance of colonel menard s name peggy cared nothing for the fate of colonel menard indeed i believe his mind dwells more on his sister now than on any one else i hate people s relations cried peggy brutally especially their sick relations i could nt run every evening to pet maria jones and feed her pap i do not pet her nor the defensive do nt be a little beast peggy she added in french i see how it is you are going to take him the man who needs a bug in his ear worse than any other man in the territory will never be handed over to me to get it but let me tell you you will have your hands full with rice jones this welsh english stock is not soft stuff to manage when he makes that line with his lips that looks like a red hot razor edge his poor wife will wish to leave this earth and take to the bluffs you appear to think a great deal about monsieur reece zhone and his future wife said angelique mischievously i know what you mean said peggy defiantly and we may as well have it out now as any time if you throw him at me i shall quarrel with you i detest rice jones he makes me crosser than any you detest a man like that i am almost afraid of him he has a wonderful force it is a great thing at his age to be elected to the national assembly as the leader of his party in the territory i am not afraid of him said peggy with a note of pride no for i have sometimes thought peggy that monsieur reece zhone and you were made for each other peggy morrison sneered her nervous laughter however had a sound of jubilation the talk stopped there they could see fog rising like a smoke from the earth gradually making distant indistinct objects an obliterated memory and filling the place where the garden had been we must go in and call for candles said angelique no said peggy turning on the broad sill and stretching herself along it let me lay my head in your lap and watch that lovely mist come up like a dream good girl angelique part third the rising father baby s part in the common fields lay on the mississippi side of the peninsula quite three miles from town the common fields as an entire tract belonged to the community of kaskaskia no individual held any purchased or transferable right in them each man who wished to could claim his proportion of acres and plant any crop he pleased year after year he paid no rent but neither did he hold any fee in the land early on rainy summer mornings the friar loved to hoist his capote on the cord and tramp bare legged out to his two acre farm leaving his slave with a few small coins in the till to keep shop should any customer forestall his return the fathers of all orders explained father baby from their earliest foundations have counted it a worthy mortification of the flesh to till the ground and be ready to refresh me without grinning when i might send you if i were a man who loved sinful ease monastic habits are above the understanding of a black rascal like you the truth was the friar loved to play in wet dirt civilized life and the confinement of a shop worked a kind of ferment in his wild spirit which violent dancing somewhat relieved but which intimate contact with the earth cooled and settled father baby sometimes stripped off his capote and lay down in the hollow between furrows of corn like a very lean but peaceful pig he would not have been seen on any account and lifted an apprehensive head in the darkness of the morning if a bird rustled past this performance he called a mortification of his frame but when this sly churchman slipped up and put on his capote again his thin visage bore the same gratified lines which may be seen on the face of a child making mud pies it had rained steadily since the political field day which had drawn such risen and father baby s way to his work had been across fields of puddles through which he waded before dawn knowing well that a week s growth of weeds was waiting for him
not much puffed up or he had the art of concealment they saw alexandria in a the day he was a modest young fellow with a nose rather too large for his face a long upper lip and frank blue eyes he made himself agreeable to one of the cabinet girls on the front seat while tommy just behind him had miss van harlem and bliss for his portion the old streets the toppling roofs the musty warehouses the uneven pavement all pleased the young creatures out in the sunshine they made merry over the ancient ball room where washington had asked a far away ancestress of beatoun to dance and they decorously walked through the old church it happened in the church mrs carriswood was behind the others so she saw them come in the same little old couple of the capitol in the chancel beatoun was explaining beside beatoun shone a curly black head that they knew mrs carriswood sat in one of the high old pews through a crack she could look into the next pew and there they stood molly let s be getting out of this he is here with all his grand friends do nt let us be interrupting him the old woman s voice was so like tommy s that it made mrs carriswood start very softly she spoke i only want to look at him a minute pat jest a minute i ai nt seen him for so long and is it any longer for you than for me retorted the husband ye know what ye promised if i d be taking you here unbeknownst do nt look his way look like ye was a stranger to him do nt let us be mortifying him wid our country ways like as not t is the prisidint himself he is colloguein wid this blessed minute shtep back and be a stranger to him woman a stranger to him his own mother but she stepped back she turned her patient face then all over his face he took two steps down the aisle and caught the little figure in his arms why mother he cried why mother where did you drop from and before mrs carriswood could speak she saw him step back and push young sackville forward crying this is my father this is the boy that knew your grandmother he did it so easily he was so entirely unaffected so perfectly unconscious that there was nothing at all embarrassing for anyone even the cabinet girl with a grandmother in very humble life who must be kept in the background could not feel disconcerted for this happy result mrs carriswood owns a share of the credit she advanced on the first pause and claimed acquaintanceship with the fitzmaurices the story of their last meeting and tommy s first triumph in oratory came of course the famous horseshoe received due mention and tommy described with much humor his terror of passage was a natural transition equally natural the transition to tommy s grandmother the irish famine and the benevolence of lady sackville everybody was interested and it was sackville himself who brought the fitzmaurices noble ancestors the apocryphal viscounts fitzmaurice of king james s creation on to the carpet he was entirely serious my grandmother told me of your great grandfather lord fitzmaurice she saw him ride to hounds once when she was a little girl they say he was the boldest rider in ireland and a renowned duellist too king james gave the title to his grandfather did nt he and the countryside kept it if it was given rather too late in the day to be useful i am glad you have restored the family fortunes mr fitzmaurice the cabinet girl looked on tommy with respect and miss van harlem blushed like an angel all is lost said mrs carriswood to herself yet she smiled going home old virginian dinner had been most successful the fitzmaurices who had been almost forced into the banquet by beatoun s imperious hospitality were not a wet blanket in the least patrick fitzmaurice brogue and all was an irish gentleman without a flaw he blossomed out into a modest wag and told two or three comic stories as acceptably as he was used to tell them to a very different circle only carrying a fresher flavor of wit to this circle perhaps it enjoyed them more mrs fitzmaurice looked scared and ate almost nothing with the greatest propriety and her fork in her left hand yet even she thawed under miss van harlem s attentions and gentle mrs beatoun s tact and the winning ways of the last beatoun baby she took this absent cherub to her heart with such undissembled warmth that its mother ever since has called her a sweet funny little old lady they were both patrick and his wife quite unassuming and retiring company at the tavern door my word tommy your mother and i can git home by ourselves whispered honest patrick we ve not exceeded if the wines were good i never exceeded in my life god take the glory but he embraced tommy so affectionately in parting that i confess mrs carriswood had suspicions yet surely it is more likely that his brain was let us not say turned but just a wee bit tilted by the joy and triumph of the occasion rather than by beatoun s port or champagne but mrs carriswood s word had nothing to do with tommy s parents ostensibly though in truth it had everything to do she said will you dine with us to morrow quite en famille thomas i ought to tell you i suppose that i find your house a pretty dangerous paradise mrs carriswood says tommy and i find you a most dangerous you thank you answers tommy in a different tone you ve always been an angel to me what i owe to you and harry lossing well

roberts at the same time you must nt regard it indeed mr westgate mrs campbell mrs campbell at the same campbell campbell at the same time roberts is all absence of mind westgate westgate ha ha ha but you know ah ha ha ha ha ha ha i see capital oh excellent english word for checks excellent ah would you be good enough to say just what you mean by painting a place red campbell campbell roberts will show you if you ll only stay westgate westgate it s quite impossible now at all events to roberts but the letter you kindly gave me to your uncle roberts roberts yes yes mrs roberts mrs roberts you ll like uncle philip so much and he ll appreciate the favor edward s done him in sending mrs campbell mrs campbell at the same time he s so fond of the english and he s right on to roberts s jokes they re always at it together back and forth all the time if roberts has put up any little job uncle phil will catch on like lightning westgate westgate oh what extremely delightful expressions i m sure i sha nt remember the half of them but this letter do you really think he takes it from his pocket roberts roberts yes yes i m quite certain he ll mrs roberts mrs roberts at the same time oh yes indeed my husband was with him so much at one time they re almost of the same age westgate westgate oh indeed i fancied an old gentleman then you think that he ll understand mrs campbell mrs campbell uncle philip understands mr roberts and all his ways perfectly they have such fun when they re together time it does nt matter what edward has written he ll take it just in the right way campbell campbell at the same time yes he ll know it s some kind of a joke westgate westgate well you know i thought perhaps myself it was one of your pieces of american humor mrs roberts mrs roberts oh it was mr westgate i assure you it was just one of our pieces of american humor mrs campbell mrs campbell yes indeed you can depend upon that mr westgate westgate westgate ah well if it had been mr campbell here i should have felt sure of it but i could nt be quite so certain that mr roberts campbell campbell oh when it comes to joking americans are all alike roberts is a little more alike than the rest philip for that matter he d take it right even if roberts had nt written anything at all westgate westgate but that s just what mr roberts has done all the others all the others what westgate westgate handing the envelope to roberts who finds it empty and passes it to his wife who in turn hands it silently to mrs campbell of course i wished to read the kind things you d said of me as soon as possible and i was greatly surprised to find no letter in this envelope i was nt sure whether you intended me simply to present the envelope to your uncle or whether at all events i decided i d better come and ask campbell campbell who has possessed himself of the envelope why look here roberts you put both letters in that sealed envelope i kept mr westgate from posting in the fire alarm box roberts really mr westgate i do nt know what to say mrs roberts mrs roberts yes edward i do nt know what you will say campbell campbell roberts you re incorrigible when will you give up this habit of practical joking really old fellow you ought to stop it you and uncle phil have kept it up long enough and i think you owe mr westgate an apology the joke s on uncle phil of course but you ought to see that it s rather embarrassing to mr westgate to find himself the bearer of an empty envelope instead of a letter of introduction come now you must explain and we ll all apologize for you roberts waits with a foolish face of deprecation turning to horror at the suggestion of an explanation come you owe it to yourself as a joker westgate westgate amiably ow now not able to forgive myself if i could nt allow a man his joke but i should like an explanation you know your humor is so very different to ours and i do nt believe any one at home if i said you had given me an empty envelope to carry to your uncle could feel the spirit of it and these things are so tiresome you know when they happen to fall flat i hope you wo nt think me importunate if i say i should like to know just where

i scene one side of a sleeping car on the boston and albany road the curtains are drawn before most of the berths from the hooks and rods hang hats bonnets bags bandboxes umbrellas and other travelling gear on the floor are boots of both sexes set out for the porter to black the porter is making up the beds in the upper and lower berths adjoining the seats on which a young mother slender and pretty with a baby asleep on the seat beside her and a stout old lady sit confronting each other mrs agnes roberts and her aunt mary mrs roberts do you always take down your back hair aunty aunt mary no never child at least not since i had such a fright about it once coming on from new york it s all well enough to take down your back hair if it is yours but if it is nt your as i buy mine of madame pierrot mrs roberts do nt you wish she would nt advertise it as human hair it sounds so pokerish like human flesh you know aunt mary why she could nt call it inhuman hair my dear mrs roberts thoughtfully no just hair aunt mary then people might think it was for mattresses but as i was saying i took it off that night and tucked it safely away as i supposed in my pocket and i slept sweetly till about midnight when i happened to open my eyes and saw something long and black crawl off my bed and slip under the berth such a shriek as i gave my dear a snake a snake oh a snake and everybody began talking at once and some of the gentlemen swearing and the porter came running with the poker to kill it and all the while it was of my pocket and glad enough i was to grab it up before anybody saw it and say i must have been dreaming mrs roberts why aunty how funny how could you suppose a serpent could get on board a sleeping car of all places in the world aunt mary that was the perfect absurdity of it the porter berths ready now ladies mrs roberts to the porter who walks away to the end of the car and sits down near the door oh thank you aunty do you feel nervous the least bit aunt mary nervous no why mrs roberts well i do nt know i suppose i ve been worked up a little about meeting willis and wondering how he ll look and all we ca nt know each other of course it does nt stand to reason that if he s been out there for twelve years ever since i at least i have that he could recognize me not at the first glance you know he ll have a full beard and then i ve got married and here s the baby oh no he ll never guess who it is in the world photographs really amount to nothing in such a case i wish we were at home and it was all over i wish he had written some particulars instead of telegraphing from ogden be with you on the a m wednesday aunt mary californians always telegraph my dear they never think of writing it is nt expensive enough and it does nt make your blood run cold enough to get a letter and so they send you one of those miserable yellow despatches whenever they can those printed in a long string if possible so that you ll be sure to die before you get to the end of it i suppose your brother has fallen into ornary and which the same just like one of mr bret harte s characters mrs roberts but it is nt exactly our not knowing each other aunty that s worrying me that s something that could be got over in time what is simply driving me distracted is willis and edward meeting there when i m away from home oh how could i be away and why could nt willis have given us fair warning i would have hurried from the ends of the earth to meet him i do nt believe poor edward ever saw a californian and he s so quiet and pre occupied i m sure he d never get on with willis and if willis is the least loud he would nt like edward not that i suppose he is loud but i do nt believe he knows anything about literary men but you can see aunty ca nt you how very anxious i must be do nt you see edward met so as to to well to break them to each other do nt you know aunt mary oh you need nt be troubled about that agnes i dare say they ve got on perfectly well together very likely they re sitting down to the unwholesomest hot supper this instant that the ingenuity of man could invent mrs roberts oh do you think they are aunty oh if i could only believe they were sitting down to a hot supper together now i should be so happy they d be sure to get on if they were there s nothing like eating to make men friendly with each other do nt you know at receptions how they never have anything to say to each other till the escalloped oysters and the chicken salad appear and then how sweet they are as soon as they ve helped the ladies to ice oh thank you thank you aunty for thinking of the mind you can understand ca nt you aunty dear how anxious i must have been to have my only brother and my only my husband get on nicely together my life would be a wreck simply a wreck if they did nt and willis and i not having seen each other since
and through the investigations of father fairfield the eloquent s life in england and scotland as i have given it to you i received father fairfield s letter only this day only this day i have learned salome that you are really the duchess of hereward that the duke of hereward was and is really your husband and was never the husband of any other woman oh how bitterly how bitterly how unpardonably i have wronged him he will pardon me yes he will for he is all magnanimity and he loves me but i can never never pardon myself exclaimed the young wife her first joy at discovering the absolute integrity of her husband now giving place to the severest self condemnation you need not reproach yourself so cruelly so sternly under circumstances in which you would not reproach another at all remember what you told me you had the evidence of your own eyes and ears and the testimony of documents and of individuals against him the evidence of my own eyes and ears which mistook the counterfeit for the real the testimony of documents that were forgeries and of individuals that were false and upon these i believed my noble husband guilty of a felony and without even giving him an opportunity to explain the circumstances or to defend himself i left him even on our wedding day and have concealed myself from him for many months exposing him to misconstruction to dishonor and reproach oh no i can never never pardon myself nor do i even know how he can ever pardon me but he will i am sure he will even as the lord pardons all repented sin however grievous so will my peerless husband pardon me fervently exclaimed salome the abbess reverted to her own troubles i can not understand she said the mystery of that man s appearance here this morning what man inquired salome who was nearly forgotten the existence of other men what man why daughter the count waldemar de volaski the man who came here with the woman this morning the man whom you mistook for your own husband the duke of hereward but whom i knew to be waldemar de volaski once my betrothed who was said to have been killed in a duel shot through the heart a quarter of a century ago answered the lady emphatically salome stared at the abbess for a few moments in amazed silence and then exclaimed dear madam good mother are you still under that deep delusion delusion echoed the lady yes the deepest delusion dear lady do you not know can you not comprehend now that the man who visited us this morning was no other than john scott the counterpart whom even i really did mistake for the duke of hereward as you say and that the bold bad beauty nay daughter he was count waldemar de volaski persisted the abbess what an hallucination dear lady do you not see but what is the use of talking i can not convince you of your mistake but circumstances may for of course sooner or later the unhappy man will be arrested and brought to trial for his share in the robbery and murder at castle lone no you can not convince me of mistake because i have not made any but i will convince you of yours said the lady rising and striking a match and lighting a lamp for they had hitherto sat in darkness salome smiled incredulously the abbess went to a little drawer of the stand upon which her crucifix and missal stood and drew from it a small box which she opened and exhibited to salome saying this daughter is the only memento of the world and the world s people that i have retained that it is the likeness of my once betrothed bestowed on me on the occasion of our betrothal cherished once in loyal love cherished now in prayerful memory of one whom i supposed had expiated his sins by death long long ago i have kept it but i have not looked at it for twenty years or more salome took the miniature and examined it carefully with interest and curiosity it was very well painted in water colors on ivory it represented a young man of from twenty to twenty five years of age with a roman profile fair complexion blue eyes and blonde hair and mustache and so far as these features and this complexion went the miniature certainly did bear an external and superficial resemblance to john scott and to the young duke of hereward but in character and expression the faces were so totally different that salome could never have mistaken the miniature to be a likeness of the duke or his brother or either of these men to be the miniature for a few minutes she turned to the abbess and said you tell me that you have not looked at this for twenty years i have not said the lady and you tell me that the man who visited the asylum this morning is the original of this picture i do then dear mother your memory is at fault and your imagination deceives and misleads you both the supposed original and the miniature are thin faced with roman features fair complexion blue eyes and blonde hair points of resemblance which are common to many men who are not at all alike in any other respect now look at this miniature again and you will see that except in the points i have named it is in no way like the man you mistook for its original i would rather not look at it i have not seen it since volaski s supposed death said the abbess shrinking oh mind you see so few men that you may easily mistake one blonde for another after twenty years of absence from them persisted salome pressing the open miniature upon
and cortlandt approached to examine it more closely you see said cortlandt this vertebrate for that is as definitely as we can yet describe it forces a great pressure of air into its head and it must allow to rush into its very rudimentary lower extremities distending them with such violence that the body is shot upward and forward you may have noticed the tightly inflated portion underneath as they left the ground while speaking he had moved rather near when suddenly a partially concealed mouth opened showing the unmistakable tongue and fangs of a serpent it emitted a hissing sound and the small eyes gleamed maliciously do you believe it is a poisonous species asked ayrault i suspect it is replied the doctor for though it is doubtless able to leap with great accuracy upon its prey we saw it took some time to recharge the upper air chamber so that were it not armed with poison glands it would fall an easy victim to its more powerful and swifter contemporaries and would soon become extinct as it will be unable to spring for some time said bearwarden we might as well save it the shell from his rifle he fired an explosive ball into the reptile whereupon about half the body disappeared while a sickening odour arose although the sun was still far above the horizon the rapidity with which it was descending showed that the short night of less than five hours would soon be upon them and though short it might be very dark for they were in the tropics and the sun going down perpendicularly must also pass completely around the globe instead of as in northern latitudes on earth in summer approaching the horizon obliquely and not going far below it a slight and diffused sound here seemed to rise from the ground all about them for which they could not account presently it became louder and as the sun touched the horizon it poured forth in prolonged strains the large trumpet shaped lilies reeds and heliotropes seemed fairly to throb as they raised their anthem to the sky and the setting sun while the air grew dark with until as the chorus grew fainter and gradually ceased they flew back to their nests the three companions had stood astonished while this act was played the doctor then spoke this is the most marvellous development of nature i have seen for its wonderful divergence from and yet analogy to what takes place on earth you know our flowers offer honey as it were as bait to insects that in eating or collecting it they may catch the pollen on their legs and so carry it to other flowers perhaps of the opposite sex here flowers evidently appeal to the sense of hearing instead of taste and make use of birds of which there are enormous numbers instead of winged insects of which i have seen none one being perhaps the natural result of the other the flowers have become singers by long practice or else those that were most musical having had the best chance to reproduce we have a neat illustration of the survival by a shrinking of the fibres as the sun withdraws its heat in which case we may expect another song at sunrise when the same result will be effected by their expanding searching for a camping place in which to pass the coming hours they saw lights flitting about like will o the wisps but brighter and intermittent they seem to be as bright as sixteen candle power lamps but the light is yellower and appears to emanate from a comparatively large surface certainly nine or ten inches square said the doctor they soon gave up the chase however for the lights were continually moving and frequently went out while groping in the growing darkness they came upon a brown object about the size of a small dog and close to the ground it flew off with a humming insect sound and as it did so it showed the brilliant phosphorescent glow they had observed that is a good sized fire fly said bearwarden evidently the insects here are on the fire flies in cuba which the cubans are said to put into a glass box and get light enough from to read by here they would need only one if it could be induced to give its light continuously having found an open space on high ground they sat down and bearwarden struck his repeater which for convenience had been arranged for jupiter time dividing the day into ten hours beginning at noon midnight being therefore five o clock twenty minutes past four said he which would correspond to about a quarter to eleven on earth as the sun rises at half past seven it will be dark about three hours for the time between dawn and daylight will of course be as short as that we have just experienced between sunset and night if we stay here long said the doctor i suppose we shall become accustomed like sailors to taking our four or in this case five or added ayrault we can sleep ten consecutive hours and take the next ten for exploring and hunting having the sun for one half the time and the moons for the other bearwarden and cortlandt now rolled themselves in their blankets and were soon asleep while ayrault whose turn it was to watch till the moons rose for they had not yet enough confidence in their new domain to sleep in darkness simultaneously leaned his back against a rock and lighted his pipe in the distance he saw the torrents of fiery lava from the volcanoes reflected in the sky and faintly heard their thunderous crashes while the fire flies twinkled unconcernedly in the hollow and the night winds swayed the fernlike branches then he gazed at the earth which but little above the horizon shone with a faint
the new life this large explanation may not account for the summer restlessness that overtakes nearly everybody we are the annual victims of the delusion that there exists somewhere the ideal spot where manners are simple and milk is pure and lodging is cheap where we shall fall at once into content we never do for content consists not in having all we want nor in not wanting everything but in not wanting that we can get in our summer flittings we carry our wants with us to places where they can not be gratified a few people have discovered that repose can be had at home but this discovery is too unfashionable to find favor we have no rest except in moving about looked at superficially it seems curious that the american is as a rule the only person who does not emigrate the fact is that he can go nowhere else where life is so uneasy and where consequently he would have so little of his sort of repose to put him in another country would be like putting a nineteenth century man back into the eighteenth century the american wants to be at the head of the procession as he fancies he is where he can hear the band play and be the first to see the fireworks of the new era he thinks that he occupies an advanced station of observation from which his telescope can reason he thinks so for not seldom he takes up a foreign idea and tires of it before it is current elsewhere more than one great writer of england had his first popular recognition in america even this season the saturday review is struggling with ibsen while boston having had that disease has probably gone on to some other fad far be it from us to praise the american for his lack of repose it is enough to attempt to account for it but from the social or rather society point of view the subject has a disquieting aspect if the american young man and young woman get it into their heads that repose especially of manner is the correct thing they will go in for it in a way to astonish the world the late cultivation of idiocy by the american dude was unique he carried it to an extreme impossible to the youth of any nation less gifted and if the american girl goes in seriously for to any modern languidity or to any ancient marble if what is wanted in society is cold hauteur and languid superciliousness or lofty immobility we are confident that with a little practice she can sit stiller and look more impassive and move with less motion than any other created woman we have that confidence in her ability and adaptability it is a question whether it is worth while to do this to sacrifice the vivacity and charm native to her and the natural impulsiveness and generous gift of herself which belong to a new race in a new land which is walking always towards the sunrise in fine although so much is said of the american lack of repose is it not best for the american to be content to be himself and let the critics adapt themselves or not as they choose to a new phenomenon let us stick a philosophic name to it and call it repose in activity the american might take the candid advice given by one friend to get into the right frame of mind the best thing you can do he said is to frame your mind and hang it up women ideal and real we have not by any means got to the bottom of realism it matters very little what the novelists and critics say about it what it is and what it is not the attitude of society towards it is the important thing even if the critic could prove that nature and art are the same thing and that the fiction which is real is only a copy of nature or if another should prove that reality is only to be found in the ideal little would be gained literature is well enough in its place art is an agreeable pastime and it is right that society should take up either in seasons when lawn tennis and polo are impracticable and afternoon teas become flavorless but the question that society is or should be interested in is whether the young woman of the future is going to shape herself by a realistic or an ideal standard it should be said in parenthesis that the young woman of the passing period has inclined towards realism in manner and speech if not in dress affecting a sort of frank return to the easy going ways of nature itself even to the adoption of the language of the stock exchange the race course and the clubs an offering of herself on the altar of good fellowship with the view no doubt of making life more agreeable to the opposite sex forgetting the fact that men fall in love always or used to in the days when they could afford that luxury with an ideal woman or if not with an ideal woman with one whom they idealize and at this same time the world is full of doubts and questionings as to whether marriage is a failure have these questionings anything to do with the increasing realism of women and a consequent loss of ideals of course the reader sees that the be estimated as a work of nature or of art and here comes in the everlasting question of what is the highest beauty and what is most to be desired the greek artists it seems to be well established never used a model as our artists almost invariably do in their plastic and pictorial creations the antique greek statues or their copies which give us the highest conceptions of feminine charm and
besprinkled with sand the novelty of the situation the beauty of the sand wreaths the intoxication of the air the vivid brilliancy of the sun and the sky delighted caius the blue of heaven rounded the sandscape to their present sight a dome of blue flame over a plain whose colour was like that of an autumn leaf become sear caius in his exhilaration either the prospect was too common to o shea to excite his interest or the enterprise he meditated burdened his mind he gave few words in answer and soon they too relapsed into the silence that the boy and the pony had all the time observed an hour s walk and another sound rang in their ears beside the whistling of the wind low at first and fitful louder and louder till the roar of the surf was deafening then they came to the brink and heard all the notes of which the chords of its more distant music had been composed the gasping sob of the under tow the rush of the lifting wave as it upreared itself high the silken break of its foam the crash of drums with which it fell the dash of wave against wave and the cry of the foremost waves that bemoaned themselves prostrate upon the beach the cart with its little company turned into the narrow strip of dark damp sand that the tide firmer and the wind struck them obliquely the hardy pony broke into its natural pace a moderate trot in spite of this pace the progress they made was not very swift and it was already four by the clock o shea climbed to his place on the front of the cart the boy sprang down and ran to warm himself clapping his gloved hands as he ran it was not long before caius clambered into his straw seat again and sitting watched the wonder of the waves so level was the beach so high was the surf that from the low cart it seemed that gigantic monsters were constantly arising from the sea and just as the fear of them overshadowed the fascinated mind they melted away again into nothingness as he looked at the waves he saw that their water mixed with sand was a yellowish brown and dark almost to black when the curling top yawned before the downfall but so fast did each wave break one glimpses and boiling fields of foam and high crests of foam were the main substance of all that was to be seen for a hundred yards from the shore proceeding thus they soon came to what was actually the end of the island and were on the narrow ridge of sand dunes which extended a distance of some twenty miles to the next island the sand hills rising sheer from the shore fifty sixty or a hundred feet in height bordered their road on the right to avoid the soft dry sand of their base the pony often trotted in the shallow flow of the foam which even yet now and then crept over all the damp beach to the high water mark the wind was like spur and lash the horse fled before it eyes and ears grew accustomed even to the threatening of the sea monsters the sun of the november afternoon sank nearer and nearer the level of sand and foam they could not see the ocean beyond the foam when it grew large and red red gold appeared round it lying where the edge of the sea must be like the islands of the blessed when the crests of the breakers near and far began to be touched with a fiery glow when the soft dun brown of the sand hills turned to gold caius overcome with having walked and eaten much and drunk deeply of the wine of the wild salt wind fell into a heavy dreamless slumber lying outstretched upon his bed of straw chapter iv where the devil lived caius did not know how long he slept he woke with a sudden start and a presentiment of evil it was quite dark as black as starlight night could be for the foam of the waves hardly glimmered to sight except here and there where some phosphorescent jelly was tossed among them like a blue death light what had wakened caius was the sound of voices talking ahead of the cart and the jerk of the cart as it was evidently being driven off the he sat up and strove to pierce the darkness by sight they had come to no end of their journey the long beach with its walls of foam and of dune stretched on without change but upon this beach they were no longer travelling the horse was headed as it were to the dune and now began to climb its almost upright side with an imprecation he threw himself out of the cart at a bound into sand so soft that he sank up to the knees and stumbled against the upright side of the hill the lower voice he had heard was silent instantly o shea stopped the pony with a sharp word of interrogation where are you going shouted caius what are you going to do he need not have shouted for the wind was swift to carry all sounds from his lips to o shea but the latter s voice as it came back to him seemed to stagger against the force of the wind well we re going roight up towards the sky at present but in a minute we ll be going roight down towards the other place if ye just keep on at that side of the cart ye ll get into a place where we ll have a bit of shelter and rest till the moon rises what is the matter what are you turning off the road for caius shouted again half dazed by his sleep
within me and she was not unreasonable in her wish to see the matter settled one way or the other but i did not feel like taking a bold step her to give herself to me she ought to offer me some reason to suppose that she would make the gift if i saw no probability of such generosity i would prefer that things should remain as they were that evening i was sitting with madeline in the moon lit porch it was nearly ten o clock and ever since supper time i had been working myself up to the point of making an avowal of my sentiments i had not positively determined to do this but wished gradually to reach the proper point when if the prospect looked bright i might speak my companion appeared to understand the situation at least i imagined that the nearer i came to a proposal the more she seemed to expect it it was certainly a very critical and important epoch in my life if i spoke i should make myself happy or miserable forever and if i did not speak i had every reason to believe that the lady would not give me another chance to do and thinking very hard over these momentous matters i looked up and saw the ghost not a dozen feet away from us he was sitting on the railing of the porch one leg thrown up before him the other dangling down as he leaned against a post he was behind madeline but almost in front of me as i sat facing the lady it was fortunate that madeline was looking out over the landscape for i must have appeared very much startled the ghost had told me that he would see me sometime this night but i did not think he would make his appearance when i was in the company of madeline if she should see the spirit of her uncle i could not answer for the consequences i made no exclamation but the ghost evidently saw that i was troubled do nt be afraid he said i shall not let her see me and she can not hear me speak unless i address myself to her suppose i looked grateful so you need not trouble yourself about that the ghost continued but it seems to me that you are not getting along very well with your affair if i were you i should speak out without waiting any longer you will never have a better chance you are not likely to be interrupted and so far as i can judge the lady seems disposed to listen to you favorably that is if she ever intends to do so there is no knowing when john hinckman will go away again certainly not this summer if i were in your place i should never dare to make love to hinckman s niece if he were anywhere about the place if he should catch any one offering himself to miss madeline he would then be a terrible man to encounter i agreed perfectly to all this i can not bear to think of him i ejaculated aloud think of whom asked madeline situation the long speech of the ghost to which madeline paid no attention but which i heard with perfect distinctness had made me forget myself it was necessary to explain quickly of course it would not do to admit that it was of her dear uncle that i was speaking and so i mentioned hastily the first name i thought of mr vilars i said this statement was entirely correct for i never could bear to think of mr vilars who was a gentleman who had at various times paid much attention to madeline it is wrong for you to speak in that way of mr vilars she said he is a remarkably well educated and sensible young man and has very pleasant manners he expects to be elected to the legislature this fall and i should not be surprised if he made his mark he will do well in a legislative body for whenever mr vilars has anything to say he knows just how and when and without any show of resentment which was all very natural for if madeline thought at all favorably of me she could not feel displeased that i should have disagreeable emotions in regard to a possible rival the concluding words contained a hint which i was not slow to understand i felt very sure that if mr vilars were in my present position he would speak quickly enough i know it is wrong to have such ideas about a person i said but i can not help it the lady did not chide me and after this she seemed even in a softer mood as for me i felt considerably annoyed for i had not wished to admit that any thought of mr vilars had ever occupied my mind you should not speak aloud that way said the ghost or you may get yourself into trouble i want to see everything go well with you because then you may be disposed to help me especially if which i hope i shall be i longed to tell him that there was no way in which he could help me so much as by taking his instant departure to make love to a young lady with a ghost sitting on the railing near by and that ghost the apparition of a much dreaded uncle the very idea of whom in such a position and at such a time made me tremble was a difficult if not an impossible thing to do but i forbore to speak although i may have looked my mind i suppose continued the ghost that you have not heard anything that might be of advantage to me of course i am very anxious to hear but if you have anything to tell me i can
listening eagerly to every word when she concluded mrs andrews mused a moment and then said henceforth miss earl and i shall take pleasure in introducing you to such of my friends as will appreciate your talent i hope you will not confine yourself exclusively to my children but come down sometimes in the evening and sit with me and moreover i prefer that you should dine with us instead of with these nursery folks who are not quite capable of appreciating you how do you know that mamma i can tell you one thing i appreciated her before i found out that she was likely to be famous before i knew that mr manning condescended to notice her we nursery folk judge for ourselves we do nt wait to find out what other people think and i sha nt give up miss earl she is my governess and i wish you would just let her alone there was a touch of scorn in the boy s impatient tone and his mother bit her lip and laughed constrainedly really felix she should consider herself exceedingly fortunate as she is the first of all your teachers with whom you have not quarrelled most shamefully even fought and scratched and because she is sweet and good and pretty and i love her you must interfere and take her off to entertain your company she came here to take care of hattie and me and not to go down stairs to see visitors she ca nt go mamma i want her myself you have all the world to talk to and i have only her do nt meddle mamma you are very selfish and ill tempered my poor little boy and i am heartily ashamed of you if i am it is because hush felix edna laid her hand on the pale curling lips of the cripple and luckily at this instant mrs andrews was summoned from the room scarcely waiting till the door closed after her the boy exclaimed that means happy lucky and she had no right to give me such a name i am infelix nobody loves me nobody cares for me except to pity me and i would rather be strangled than pitied i wish i was dead and at rest in greenwood i wish somebody would knock my brains out with my crutch and save me from hobbling through life even my mother is ashamed of my deformity she ought to have treated me as the spartans did their dwarfs she ought to have thrown me into the east river before i was a day old i wish i was dead oh i do i do felix it is very wicked to i tell you i wo nt be called felix whenever i hear the name it makes me feel as i did one day when my crutches slipped on the ice and i fell on the pavement before the door and some newsboys stood and laughed at me tombstone when i am buried he trembled from head to foot and angry tears dimmed his large flashing eyes while hattie sat with her elbows resting on her knees and her chin in her hands looking sorrowfully at her brother edna put her arm around the boy s shoulder and drew his head down on her lap saying tenderly your mother did not mean that she was ashamed of her son but only grieved and mortified by his ungovernable temper which made him disrespectful to her i know that she is very proud of your fine intellect and your ambition to become a thorough scholar and oh yes and of my handsome body and my pretty feet my dear little boy it is sinful for you to speak in that way and god will punish you if you do not struggle against such feelings i do nt see how i can be punished any more than i have been already happen suppose you were poor and friendless an orphan with no one to care for you suppose you had no dear good little sister like hattie to love you now felix i know that the very fact that you are not as strong and well grown as most boys of your age only makes your mother and all of us love you more tenderly and it is very ungrateful in you to talk so bitterly when we are trying to make you happy and good and useful look at little lila shut up in silence unable to speak one word or to hear a bird sing or a baby laugh and yet see how merry and good natured she is how much more afflicted she is than you are suppose she was always fretting and complaining looking miserable and sour and out of humor do you think you would love her half as well as you do now he made no reply but his thin hands covered his sallow face carpet and put her head thickly crowned with yellow curls on his knee her uncle grey had given her a pretty ring the day before and now she silently and softly took it from her own finger and slipped it on her brother s felix you and hattie were so delighted with that little poem which i read to you from the journal of eugenie de guerin that i have tried to set it to music for you the tune does not suit it exactly but we can use it until i find a better one she went to the piano and sang that pretty nursery ballad joujou the angel of the playthings hattie clapped her hands with delight and felix partly forgot his woes and grievances now i want you both to learn to sing it and i will teach hattie the accompaniment on felix s birthday which is not very distant you can surprise your father and mother by singing it for little child should sing it
so that it glittered in the sunlight now to what kingdom does this belong he asked another bright boy answered quick ly to the min er al kingdom sir all metals belong to that kingdom that is a good answer said the king the gold piece is your prize the children were de light ed with eager faces they waited to hear what the stranger would say next i will ask you only one more question said the king and it is an easy one then he stood up and said tell me my little folks to what kingdom do i belong the bright boys were puzzled now some thought of saying to the kingdom of prussia some wanted to say to the animal kingdom but they were a little afraid and looked up into the king s smiling face and said in her simple way i think to the kingdom of heaven king frederick william stooped down and lifted the little maiden in his arms tears were in his eyes as he kissed her and said so be it my child so be it the barmecide feast there was once a rich old man who was called the barmecide he lived in a beautiful palace in the midst of flowery gardens he had every thing that heart could wish in the same land there was a poor man whose name was schacabac his clothing was rags and his food was the scraps which other people had thrown away but he had a light heart and was as happy as a king once when schacabac had not had anything to eat for a long time he thought that he would go and ask the barmecide to help him the servant at the door said come in and away hungry schacabac went in and passed through many beautiful rooms looking for the barmecide at last he came to a grand hall where there were soft carpets on the floor and fine pictures on the walls and pleasant couches to lie down upon at the upper end of the room he saw a noble man with a long white beard it was the barmecide and poor schacabac bowed low before him as was the custom in that country the barmecide spoke very kindly and asked what was wanted schacabac told him about all his troubles and said that it was now two days since he had tasted bread is it possible said the barmecide you must be almost dead with hunger and here i have plenty and to spare then he turned and called ho boy bring in the water to wash our hands and then order the cook to hurry the supper schacabac had not expected to be man say not a word said the barmecide but let us get ready for the feast then the rich man began to rub his hands as though some one was pouring water on them come and wash with me he said schacabac saw no boy nor basin nor water but he thought that he ought to do as he was bidden and so like the barmecide he made a pretense of washing come now said the barmecide let us have supper he sat down as if to a table and pre tend ed to be carving a roast then he said help yourself my good friend you said you were hungry so now do nt be afraid of the food schacabac thought that he un der stood the joke and he made pretense of taking food and passing it to his mouth then he began to chew and said you boy said the old man bring on the roast goose now my good friend try this choice piece from the breast and here are sweet sauce honey raisins green peas and dry figs help yourself and remember that other good things are coming schacabac was almost dead with hunger but he was too polite not to do as he was bidden come said the barmecide have another piece of the roast lamb did you ever eat anything so delicious never in my life said schacabac your table is full of good things then eat heartily said the barmecide you can not please me better after this came the des sert the barmecide spoke of sweet meats and fruits and schacabac made believe that he was eating them now is there anything else that you would like asked the host ah no said let us drink then said the barmecide boy bring on the wine excuse me my lord said schacabac i will drink no wine for it is for bid den the barmecide seized him by the hand i have long wished to find a man like you he said but come now we will sup in earnest he clapped his hands servants came and he ordered supper soon they sat down to a table loaded with the very dishes of which they had pre tend ed to eat poor schacabac had never had so good a meal in all his life when they had finished and the table had been cleared away the barmecide said i have found you to be a man of good un der stand ing your wits are quick and you are ready always to make the best of everything come and live with me and manage my house and never again knew what it was to be hungry the endless tale in the far east there was a great king who had no work to do every day and all day long he sat on soft cushions and lis tened to stories and no matter what the story was about he never grew tired of hearing it even though it was very long there is only one fault that i find with your story he often said it is too short all the
never thought his soul immortal until his love for mercedes came into it perhaps not consciously now such thoughts would have seemed to for no man can live quite without hope as we believe hope of some event some end of suffering at least of some worthier act with jamie it was the hope of restitution he wished to leave behind him as the score of his life that he had been true to his employer and had loved his little ward and if the time could ever come when he could do more for her it would not be until his theft was made good and his hands were free as his heart to serve her again for the one thing that jamie stood for was integrity that was all the little story of his life his salary was eighteen hundred dollars at the end of the first year after his theft he had spent a hundred and fifty then he asked for two days leave of absence and went to new york where he exchanged sixteen hundred and forty dollars for spanish gold pieces a less old fashioned man would jamie could not forego the satisfaction of restoring the actual gold coming back he opened the old chest now empty one day after hours and put the pieces in the box the naked gold made a shining roll in its blackness just reaching across the lower end and poor jamie felt the first thrill of not happiness but something that was not sorrow nor shame and then he pulled down the old ledger and made the first entry on the dr side restored by james mcmurtagh june the other ten dollars had gone for his journey to new york and that night as he went home he looked about him he bowed in his queer way to one or two acquaintances who passed him unconscious that he had been cutting them for a year before supper he went in to see john hughson carrying his pipe and without waiting to be offered it asked to borrow a pinch some the good hughson was delighted pressed a slab of plug upon him and begged him to stay and have something liquid with his pipe but jamie would not he was anxious to be alone his little bedroom gave upon the roof of the adjoining house in the rear and here his neighbor kept a few red geraniums in boxes and it was jamie s privilege to smoke his pipe among them so this evening after a hasty meal he hurried up there beyond the roofs of the higher houses was a radiant golden sky and in it the point of a crescent moon and even as jamie was lighting his pipe one star came old jamie breathed hard and sighed and the sigh meant rest he took a pleasure in the tobacco in the look of the sky again and with this throb of returning life in one great pulsation his love rushed back to his heart and he thought of mercedes he sat up of dawn he wrote to her ii but jamie got no answer to his letter and he wrote again again he got no answer and he wrote a third time this time by registered mail so that he got back a card with her name signed to the receipt jamie s manner unconsciously to himself had changed since that first row of gold coins had gone into the black tin box the tellers and the bookkeepers had observed it and they began to watch his mail again what was their glee to see among jamie s papers one morning a letter in the familiar feminine hand jamie s foreign mail has come the word went round i thought it must be on its way said the second bookkeeper have nt you noticed his looks lately the letter is postmarked new orleans said the messenger boy turning it over but it was felt this went beyond friendly sympathy if i see you again interfering with mcmurtagh s mail you may go what business is that of ours poor o neill hung his head abashed but all eyes were on jamie as he opened his desk he put the letter in his pocket the clerks looked at one another the suspense became unendurable when old mr bowdoin came in the cashier told him what had happened jamie s foreign mail has come again but he will never read it here sir and we ca nt send him out till lunch time the chief bookkeeper the old gentleman s eyes twinkled mcmurtagh he cried mr bowdoin had always called jamie so since he came into the bank will you kindly step down to my counting room i will meet you there in a few minutes and there are some accounts i want you to straighten out for me as jamie hurried down to the long wharf he pressed his coat tight and he felt it warm against his breast neither mr james bowdoin nor harley was in the little room it was just as jamie remembered it when he first had entered it no pretense of business was made there now and he tore the letter open thus it ran new orleans august my dear dear jamie if i have not written to you it was only because i did not want to bring more trouble on you but things have gone from bad to worse with us i feel that i should be almost too unhappy to live only that david is with me now jamie sobbed a little at this i wanted never to ask you for money again but we are very very poor i will not give it to him but if you could send me a little money a hundred dollars would last me a long time your loving m st clair jamie laid his head upon the old what could he
your sake and work my uttermost to in the end good night once more good night my beautiful my own good night bill god bless you she sobbed as she turned her horse and followed the texan at a gallop chapter viii foiled by a woman it was their last night in town before breaking up camp and the black hillers as they already called themselves under chichester were determined to have a lively time of it they commenced wetting up or pouring down liquid lightning in camp but being reminded that what they used there would be missed on their journey they started to skin the saloons in town and finish out their spree where it would not diminish their own stores as wild bill said they were going where money would be of little account if all the stories about the gold to be found were true so what they spent now they would nt have to carry and they went in as such reckless men could and drinking with a looseness that promised headaches on the morrow if nothing more wild bill went in on the spree with a rush as if he wished to drown the remembrance of his late fright and despite the cautions of his friend captain jack who strove hard to keep him within bounds california joe of course was in his element and in a little while all the party became so turbulent that crawford left them in disgust for as addie neidic had said of him despite his associations he was a gentleman by midnight every saloon had been visited and many of them pretty well cleaned out and now bill proposed to go and break a faro bank that some of the party spoke of i have seven hundred dollars left out of a thousand my woman gave me before i started said he i ll lose that or break the bank see if i do nt all of the party he was before the green board without even waiting to get the run of the game be planked a hundred dollars on the king and lost without a word he put two hundred dollars more on the same card and won he left the four hundred down and in another turn he had eight hundred luck is with me boys he shouted i ll break the bank let her swing for the king once more mr dealer to the wonder of all though it was the last turn of the cards the king won and wild bill picked up sixteen hundred dollars his friends now urged him to quit but the demon of the game had entered his soul and he swore with a terrible oath that he would play till he broke the bank or was broke himself a new pack was now put in the box and once more the dealer cried out make your bets gentlemen make with a reckless bravado as much of rum as of his own nature again laid all his winnings on one card this time the queen and with wonderful luck it could be nothing else he again doubled his pile this time his gains being thirty two hundred dollars stop now bill cried california joe this ca nt last it shall last the bank ca nt stand more than two more such pulls shouted bill wildly and again on the same card he staked his entire winnings the dealer and banker were one he turned pale but when all bets were down he pulled his cards without a tremor in his hand but a groan broke from his lips as the queen once more came out on the winning side once more bill s stakes were doubled and this time he changed his card the banker hesitated his capital would hardly cover the pile if bill won again keep on whispered a voice i ll stake your bank the banker looked up and saw though she was disguised in male attire a face he well knew it was that of addie neidic and he knew she was able to keep her word wild bill had heard the whisper and his face was white with rage for he thought the bank would succumb before it would risk another chance with his wonderful luck but he let his money lay where he put it and cried out to the banker to go on with his game if he dared the latter with firm set lips cried out game ready gentlemen game ready the cards were drawn and once more wild bill had won coolly as if money was no more than waste paper bill gathered up the pile and began to thrust it away in his pockets when the disguised woman addie neidic thrust a roll of thousand dollar notes into the hands of the banker and cried out let no braggart go away and say he has bluffed the bank till he breaks it wild bill trembled from head to foot i know you he hissed you are the woman who bluffed me at the livery stable i ll win your fifty thousand dollars and then blow the top of any man s head off who ll take your part play do nt boast put up your money was the scornful reply in an instant bill put every dollar he had won every cent he had in the world and a gold watch on top of that on the jack not another man around the table made a bet a pin could have been heard had it fallen to the floor so complete was the silence the banker cried out game ready and slowly drew the cards jack loses he cried a second after and bill s pile watch and all not you shall die for this he shouted and his hand went to his belt but even as his hand touched his pistol he heard that fearful whisper sister and
his thoughts were even then busy with the subject of the address which as president he was to deliver on that occasion it seemed to me that i had never seen him when his mind was more active or more vigorous i was not of which were distinctly novel at least to me but by the felicity and effectiveness with which they were put never too had i been more impressed with the suavity the agreeableness the general charm of his manner he had determined during the coming winter to learn to ride the wheel and we then and there planned to take a bicycle trip during the following summer as we had previously made excursions together on horseback when we parted it was with the agreement that we should meet the next spring in washington and fix definitely upon the time and region of our intended ride it was on a saturday morning that i bade him good by apparently in the best of health and spirits it was on the evening of the following saturday october th that the condensed passionless relentless message which the telegraph transmits informed me that he had died that afternoon that very day he had lunched at a friend s where were gathered several of his special house and then had gone to the office of the hartford courant there was not the slightest indication apparent of the end that was so near after the company broke up he started out to pay a visit to one of the city parks of which he was a commissioner on his way thither feeling a certain faintness he turned aside into a small house whose occupants he knew and asked to sit down for a brief rest and then as the faintness increased to lie undisturbed on the lounge for a few minutes the few minutes passed and with them his life in the strictest sense of the words he had fallen asleep from one point of view it was an ideal way to die to the individual death coming so gently so suddenly is shorn of all its terrors it is only those who live to remember and to lament that the suffering comes which has been spared the victim even to them however prepared for the coming of the inevitable event it would have been none the less painful when it actually came warner as a writer we all know the various and varying opinions entertained about the quality and value of his work do not require notice here future times will assign him his exact position in the roll of american authors and we need not trouble ourselves to anticipate as we shall certainly not be able to influence its verdict but to only a comparatively few of those who knew him as a writer was it given to know him as a man to still fewer to know him in that familiarity of intimacy which reveals all that is fine or ignoble in a man s personality scanty is the number of those who will come out of that severest of ordeals so successfully as he the same conclusion would be reached whether we were to consider him in his private relations or in his career as a man of letters among the irritable race of authors no one years of close intercourse in which he constantly gave utterance to his views both of men and things with absolute unreserve i recall no disparaging opinion ever expressed of any writer with whom he had been compared either for praise or blame he had unquestionably definite and decided opinions he would point out that such or such a work was above or below its author s ordinary level but there was never any ill nature in his comment no depreciation for depreciation s sake never in truth was any one more loyal to his friends if his literary conscience would not permit him to say anything in favor of something which they had done he usually contented himself with saying nothing whatever failing there was on his critical side was due to this somewhat uncritical attitude for it is from his particular friends that the writer is apt to get the most dispassionate consideration and sometimes the coldest commendation it was a part of warner s generous recognition of others that he was in all sincerity disposed to attribute to ability of which some of them at least were much inclined to doubt their own possession were i indeed compelled to select any one word which would best give the impression both social and literary of warner s personality i should be disposed to designate it as urbanity that seems to indicate best the one trait which most distinguished him either in conversation or writing whatever it was it was innate not assumed it was the genuine outcome of the kindliness and broad mindedness of his nature and led him to sympathize with men of all positions in life and of all kinds of ability it manifested itself in his attitude towards every one with whom he came in contact it led him to treat with fullest consideration all who were in the least degree under his direction and converted in consequence the toil of subordinates into a pleasure it impelled him to do unsought everything which lay in his power for the success of those in whom he felt interest many a young writer will recall his when the quiet appreciation of one meant more to him than did later the loud applause of many as it was in public so it was in private life the generosity of his spirit the geniality and high bred courtesy of his manner rendered a visit to his home as much a social delight as his wide knowledge of literature and his appreciation of what was best in it made it an intellectual entertainment thomas r lounsbury the relation of literature to life preliminary
thought he would i am glad it is such a beautiful home for him look at that slope to the bay there is no nobler park in england and the house is as big as most of their palaces and much more comfortable give the child to colette mother and listen to me now that i have settled you and him here i must go and earn your living yes she followed him into the hall i leave you to morrow there is no time to be lost you are going back to art george no never frances grew wound i did not mean to remind you of of no it is nt that he scowled at the fire art meant for him his own countless daubs and the sickening smell of oily paints and musk and soiled silk tea gowns and the whole slovenly disreputable scramble of bohemian life in paris i loathe art he said with a furious blow at the smouldering log in the fireplace as if he struck these things all down into the ashes with it will you go back into the church dear his mother ventured timidly most certainly no he said vehemently of all mean frauds the perfunctory priest is the meanest if i could be like one of the old holy gospellers then indeed he was silent a moment and then began to stride up and down the long hall his head thrown back his chest inflated i have a message for the world mother she interrupted eagerly but i must deliver it in my own way i have lost two years i am going to put in big strokes of work now in the next two years i intend to take my proper place in my own country i will find standing room for george waldeaux with a complacent smile and in the meantime of course i must make money enough to support you and the boy handsomely so you see mother he ended laughing i have no time to lose no george it was the proudest moment of her life how heroic and generous he was she filled his pocket book the next day when he went to new york to take the world by the throat it was really not george waldeaux s fault that she filled it nor was it his fault that during the next two years the world was in no hurry to run to his feet either to learn gold the little man did his best he put his message as he called it into poems into essays into a novel publishers thanked him effusively for the pleasure of reading them and sent them back the only word of his which reached the public was a review of the work of a successful author it was so personal so malignant that george when he read it writhed with shame and humiliation he tore the paper into fragments am i so envious and small as that before god no words of mine shall ever go into print again he said and he kept his word he came down every month or two to his mother why not try teaching george she said anxiously these great scholars and scientific men have places and reputations which even you need not despise he laughed bitterly i tried for a place as tutor in a third class school and could nothing it occurred to him to go into politics and help reform the world by routing a certain irish boss he made a speech at a ward meeting and broke down in the middle of it before the storm of gibes and hootings what was the matter he asked a friend whose face was red with laughter my dear fellow you should nt lecture them you re not the parson they resent your air of enormous superiority for heaven s sake do nt speak again in this campaign it is a wretched story there is no need of going into the details there was no room for him he tried in desperation to get some foothold in business the times were hard that winter which of course was against him besides his critical haughty air naturally did not prepossess employers in his favor when he came to ask for a job at the end of the second year the man broke down the belongs to specialists even a bootblack knows his trade i know nothing i can do nothing i am a mass of flabby pretences every month she filled his pocket book she found at last that he did not touch the money he sold his clothes and his jewelry to keep himself alive while he tramped the streets of new york looking for work he starved himself to make this money last his flesh was lead colored from want of proper food and he staggered from weakness he that will not work neither let him eat he said grimly it was about this time that miss vance came home mrs waldeaux in a moment of weakness gave her a hint of his defeat is the world blind she cried to deny work to a man of george s capacity what does it mean clara heard of george s sufferings with equanimity the truth is she said when she told the up to believe that he was a grand llama among men there is no work for grand llamas in this country and when he understands that he is made of very ordinary clay indeed he will probably be of some use in the world lucy was watering her roses it is a matter of indifference to me she said what the people of new york think of mr waldeaux clara looked at her quickly i do not quite catch your meaning she said but lucy filled her can and forgot to answer chapter xvii clara had brought miss dunbar back and established her in her own house near
one of the chief joys of your future i have always wanted you to marry only i have always said to myself not yet i ca nt spare him yet mothers begin their children s lives by being the most unselfish beings in the world and then as we grow older i m afraid we are inclined to go to the other extreme i wo nt tell a falsehood and say i am glad you are going to be married now forgive me dear forgive me but in my heart there is still the same cry not yet not yet oh i know i m wrong it is to be and after all i was so unprepared and you are my life dear my everything you must let me sigh just a little i ll promise to be all smiles at the wedding when you first laughed in the sun and twinkled your baby eyes at the stars i was not a very happy woman you were only six months old when i divorced your father how much i have regretted that step since it would have been far better had i borne with him he was the only man in the world for me and he would have come back to me if i had only waited then instead of dying wretchedly miserable as he did he might have been alive to day and we would be companions for each other but i was proud and wilful however enough of that as i said when you were a tiny baby i was an unhappy woman with an heart empty and bruised how i i tell you nor can you imagine the comfort the blessing you became to me your butterfly like little kisses made well all the bruises your little hands with their soft flower like caresses smoothed away the troubles and before long you seemed to have crept in little body little soul into my heart till you filled it completely and now i must share oh we are selfish we mothers for i want all all i used to be a little jealous in those early days even of your nurse do you know rob that i bathed my baby every morning of your little life so long as you took infant tubs i would nt leave it to anyone else and for more than one year of your life in the middle of each night and early morning i warmed over a little spirit lamp i have it yet your preparation of milk and fed it to you so way if the doctor would nt let me feed you as i hungered to do how soon it was you knew me i could make you smile when no one else could and what a joy it was to see a love for me coming into your infantile existence i had cried a good deal before you were born and some afterward first out of relief and then for pure gladness but under your dear influence i gradually forgot how tears came you almost never cried and what a good baby you were oh a blessed baby and i tried to repay you by not worrying you with too many kisses with too much loving which i m sure is not good for a child sometimes i had to clench my hands so strong was my desire to take you up and clasp you tight then how quickly you began to grow and before long my letters and intimate conversation began to be filled with what rob said this morning i never knew so naively witty a child and soon you reached the age when i could play the role of comforter the knocks and bruises i ve healed by kissing them do you remember one third i m sure i do nt the many imagined slights of your little friends which were forgotten on my lap the little aches and pains that were slept away in my arms how full my life was then what a blessed boy you were and then those half lonely years when everyone frightened me by saying you would be spoiled into sending you away to school i begrudge those months i spent without you yet but how we enjoyed the vacations that s when we began reading together again real stories not those of the younger days do you remember your favorite when a very small boy we always read it when you were nt feeling very well or after you d been punished for being naughty sitting together in the great big old whose mother died in a garret and they were so terribly poor they had to beg a coffin for her and they alone followed it to the grave there was a very trying and sad woodcut of the two little orphans doing this and we always cried together over it it was nt a healthy story for a small boy and i do nt know how we got hold of it oh yes i do it was published by the tract society and had a moral it was your aunt sent it to you but i have forgotten the moral the football period began in the school vacations and went all through college but still i think you were always more fond of books and music than athletics and i was never good at outdoor sports i only managed to master tennis so as to be able to play with you the four years of college had some loneliness in them too but i enjoyed my visits to williamstown and a good deal again for i said when rob comes out he will want to go he will have at least three cotillon years and i want him to go in the best society we have besides there is sure to be a wife let her be a girl of our own position and class but
mary said she this is where mr hatt always used to get on the train there are the hatt mills and he goes up and down every we were we are always afraid we ll meet him on the train of course said mary leonard leaning forward and scanning the platform with its row of idlers and its few travellers well he is nt here now we are going to escape him this time but my heart was in my mouth i do nt want samuel hatt to be the first englefield person we meet they looked up with careless curiosity at the people who entered the train there was a little girl with a bunch of common garden flowers following close behind a tired looking woman who had been obviously spending the day a florid old gentleman with gold spectacles who revealed a bald head as he removed his hat and used it for a fan they had seen him hurrying to the platform just before the train moved out a commercial traveller and a schoolboy no said mary leonard he is nt here seat in front of them and continued to fan himself the conductor came through the car warm spell we re having for october mr hatt he said as he punched the commutation ticket that was offered him mary leonard and lucy eastman gazed spellbound at the back of mr hatt s bald head they were too amazed to look away from it at each other it it must be his father gasped lucy eastman he looks a little like him then it s his father come back returned mary in an impatient whisper his father died before we ever went to englefield and do nt you remember he was always fanning himself their fascinated gaze left the shiny pink surface of samuel hatt s head and their eyes met i hope he wo nt see us giggled lucy i hope not let s look the other way in a few minutes mr made a solemn but wavering way down the car to greet a man who sat just across the aisle from mary leonard both the women avoided his eyes blushing a little and with the fear of untimely mirth about their lips as he talked with their neighbor however they ventured to look at him and as he turned to go back his slow deliberate glance fell upon them rested a moment and without a flicker of recognition passed on and he resumed his place there was almost a shadow in the eyes that met again as the women turned towards one another i i know it s funny said lucy a little tremulously but i do nt quite like it that we look to him just as he does to us we have hair on our heads said mary leonard but she added less aggressively we need nt have worried about his speaking to us train rumbled into a covered station mary leonard started to her feet and then paused and looked down at her companion this englefield this the quiet little place where the man from the hotel consented to look after their trunks while their cousins drove them up in the wagon this noisy station with two or three hotel stages and shouting drivers of public carriages lucy said she sitting down again in momentary despair we ve gone back thirty five years but we forgot to take englefield with us it did not take long however to adapt themselves to the new conditions they arranged to stay at the inn that was farthest from the centre of things and the drive out restored some of the former look of the place it was near sunset the road looked pink before them as they left the city the boys had set fire to little piles of early fallen leaves along the sides of the streets and a faint pungent smoke hung leaped forth vividly now and then from the dusky heaps as they left the paved city for the old inn which modern travel and enterprise had left on the outskirts the sky showed lavender through a mistiness that was hardly palpable enough for haze the browns and reds of the patches of woods in the near distance seemed the paler steadier reproduction of the flames behind them low on the horizon the clouds lay in purple waves deepening and darkening into brown mary said lucy eastman in a low tone laying her hand on her companion s arm it s just the way it looked when we came the first time of all do you remember remember it s as if it were yesterday oh lucy i do nt know about a new heaven but i m glad i m glad it is nt a new earth quite yet there was a mistiness in the eyes of the women that none of the moved by the sudden sweet recognition that seemed sadder than any change the next morning they left the house early that they might have long hours in which to hunt up old haunts and renew former associations again the familiar look of things departed as they wandered about the wider gayer streets the house in which mary leonard s cousins had lived had been long in other hands and the occupants had cut down the finest of the old trees to make room for an addition and a woman whose face seemed provokingly foreign to the scene came out with the air of a proprietor and entered her carriage as they passed at another place which they used to visit on summer afternoons and which had been approached by a little lane making it seem isolated and distant the beautiful turf had been removed to prepare a bald and barren tennis court and they reached it by an electric car even the little candy shop had become a hardware store of course when one thinks of such
might be the marshes of essex or indeed the blue sea itself this apple tree crowned peak was a kind of lookout from the dead country to the living sea miss ellwell brought thornton out at the mound of stones on the crest they rested their arms on the wall looking east searchingly for the bit of blue coast and the sails there there i can see it she cried he looked at her incredulously there was nothing but a nebulous mass of blue well i have seen it she protested two or three times to day it is a bit hazy why do you want to see it he asked idly oh it is so different it is big and strange and unfamiliar do nt you like it there is a world beyond turned to the shade of the nut trees in the july sun the woods seemed asleep merely soothed by a wandering breeze and they flung themselves down on the warm ground all about the air swam with pleasant heated drowsy earthy odors as she took off her hat and nestled back into the undergrowth thornton felt her anaemic body pale from the fatigue of the hot walk as if the water lily were drooping in the mid day sun yet she was somehow intimately connected with the brooding earth there were two bodies the body of flesh that had come with fatigue and feebleness into the world and the body of passion that was blooming into power she talked of the thousand trivialities that go to make the conversation between a man and a woman thornton lay silently stretched on the warm leaves at her feet feeling her bloodless face with its sharp blue veining each was conscious of a dynamic something in the air their minds had a frank understanding while the began once more to talk of the sea that lay down there beyond the green meadows and the blue haze a faint rose color of animation darted over the pallor and made the moist eyes flash the sea that stood in her mind for the mysteries of change of the unknown thornton knew that this wistfulness after change had nothing definite in it was merely a girl s hunger for motion yet that had divided her in his mind from her kind there is a world beyond she murmured in wondering repetition of his words the branches of the nut trees swayed in the odorous wind as if whispering yes yes we know of it that world beyond over the hills of flesh and the tedious wastes of tired bodies there is a world of peace beyond her eyes came to his face wistfully he held the keys of that beyond something had snapped in his well ordered mechanism and he was going going drifting will lessly held her looking into a face that burned with love there were no words life had been too strong for his little plans it had mocked him and driven him passionward like a bit of straw caught in a gale the hours swam on unheeded while they rested there face to face then came the going home across the afternoon woods she silent and content he trying to account for himself when he had speculated about such matters he had seen himself discussing quite properly the serious affairs of life with some tall girl of distinguished carriage some one of the many young women whose acquaintance had made up his boston parties he had expected that their conversation would grow more serious as this intimacy deepened and that at last having found themselves of one accord on the sober ideals of life he should broach to her this final proposition involving both their lives he had half imagined such a situation with several fine young women the scene had always heavy hangings he in his long black afternoon coat there had been a touch of solemnity in it a weighty sense of responsibility that would have made their first kiss a little sepulchral now this her hand touched his his mind left these bizarre images and suddenly it seemed that life was one wilderness of woods in the late afternoon sun down which he was fated to wander in a lethargic dream one dominant feeling of tenderness one indifference to the baying of reason merely love and the soft warm earth and the greenness of living things and the woman whose dress brushed his arm ah that was sweet and precious at any price viii he had put something in motion on that languid july day and suddenly he was whirled along in a stream of consequences there was an interview with mr ellwell a sudden opening of the ellwell family arms and he was one of them not much to his relish ruby ellwell brought her father had chummed with the four corners renewed its worldly life in a garden party at which both engagements were announced thornton had to stand in line with his new brother in law and for all this disagreeable business the sole consolation was the happiness the woman he loved found in it for her it was a rehabilitation of the family the first dawn of those better times she had looked for all these years he remembered for all his lifetime how his father had met her how he had walked across the lawn old and gray and aloof and had taken both her hands he had smiled at her tenderly as if she were a little girl much as he had smiled years before at jarvis s mother then he had kissed her on both cheeks and had stood patting her hands in a gentle caress later he had slipped away in the same quiet abstracted manner for the rest of the day jarvis thornton had been a little sad as had planned a simple wedding for september they would walk to the village church the old white
hastening to fulfill her contract with haight chapter xliv morton rutherford was not the only one who had observed the expression on maverick s face to lyle it seemed she had never seen such venomous malignity as was in the look which he gave her stepping into the dining room a few moments after morton had left she heard imprecations and curses mingled with her own name and that of mr cameron and realized at once that their secret was known then as he hastily left the house she heard a few words of bitter hatred which would have no special meaning to his wife friends had been anticipating for the last few days readily understood the wind was now raging down the canyon with terrific force but lyle had but one thought to warn those whom she loved and save them from danger catching up a light wrap which she threw about her shoulders she rushed out of the house passing miss gladden and ned who were in the porch watching the storm and who tried to detain her lyle what is the matter where are you going they cried to the mines lyle answered raising her voice above the roar of the storm they are going to fire the mines and they are all there morton and everard and jack i must warn them if i can lyle come back shouted ned let me go she shook her head i must go i know the mines she cried and turning ran down the out of sight almost before they realized what had happened meanwhile morton rutherford had found houston without difficulty they are coming everard he announced in a low tone they will be here to night what are the indications here i judge from haight s manner that word of some kind has been received from headquarters but just what is to be done or whether there is any immediate danger i can not yet tell i am going over to haight s office for a few moments said rutherford i may catch some message from the company that will show us the situation just what i was intending to suggest said houston you will remain here until i come back yes unless i should detect some certain signs of danger in that case i shall warn the men and shall start for tunnel no that part of the mine will be safe very well you will probably hear from me within twenty or thirty minutes and rutherford started for the mills haight on returning to the office from dinner waited some little time for the expected dispatch at last it came cameron just arrived with englishman lindlay and attorney going out to the mines on evening train are at arlington hotel van dorn at same hotel and in telegraphic communication with some one at the y there is a conspiracy somewhere what do you know answer at once is everything ready he was still studying the contents of the telegram wondering just what the conspiracy might mean when minty slyly entered and by means of the information she had secured furnished him the needed key to the situation in a few moments the following answer was returned the truth is out have just discovered houston is cameron s nephew out here in his interests van dorn et al working with him cameron ready awaiting your orders just as the message was sent maverick passed on his way to his post and seeing him haight stepped to the door and called him i say jim i ve learned the truth at last about that superintendent of ours damn him you seemed so interested in old cameron this morning i thought you d like to know that it has turned out that this houston is his nephew houston old man cameron s nephew gasped maverick with a terrible oath and growing fairly livid how d ye get onto that no matter how jim but it seems he s been out here all summer getting onto some of our little business ways and reporting to the old man and now he s got the old fellow out here to see the fun never mind jim i guess the fun will be on the other side after all i ll attend to my business and d go at it with a better relish after this little piece of news maverick passed on his way regardless of the storm incapable of coherent speech muttering oaths and curses intermingled with the vilest epithets haight watching him with a grim smile for a few moments then going back to his office he had but just reseated himself at his desk when morton rutherford entered the outer room damn him what is he sneaking around here for haight soliloquized at the same time hastily transferring a revolver from his desk to his pocket i ll spoil that mug of his if he attempts any funny business here this movement was seen by rutherford who was watching him closely but he appeared to take no notice of it and entered the office as usual with a civil greeting to haight the latter sprang to his feet taking his position close by the shaded window his right hand grasping the revolver in his pocket rutherford s haight he saw there could be no semblance of civility between them it was to be open war you are a coward he said and you are a sneak haight hissed in reply prying around here when you had better be minding your own business let me tell you that i am attending to my own business and you will find before you are much older that i have more right here than you for a moment haight hesitated astonished by rutherford s words and manner then was about to make some reply when the click of the instrument attracted his attention keeping his eye on rutherford he gave the
forty pounds a year he complains that the clergy were taxed more than ever the church having become an ass whereon every man is to ride to market and cast his wallet they paid tenths and first fruits and subsidies so that out of twenty pounds of a benefice the incumbent did not reserve more than l s d for himself and his family they had to pay for both prince and laity and both grumbled at and slandered them harrison gives a good account of the higher painful diligence in their calling and that the clergy of england were reputed on the continent as learned divines skillful in greek and hebrew and in the latin tongue there was however a scarcity of preachers and ministers in elizabeth s time and their character was not generally high what could be expected when covetous patrons canceled their debts to their servants by bestowing advowsons of benefices upon their bakers butlers cooks grooms pages and lackeys when even in the universities there was cheating at elections for scholarships and fellowships and gifts were for sale the morals of the clergy were however improved by frequent conferences at which the good were praised and the bad reproved and these conferences were a notable spur unto all the ministers whereby to apply their books which otherwise as in times past would give themselves to hawking hunting tables cards dice tipling at the ale house shooting and other like vanities the learned trades and their daughters might go out to service jewell says many of them were the basest sort of people unlearned fiddlers pipers and what not not a few says harrison find fault with our threadbare gowns as if not our patrons but our wives were the causes of our woe he thinks the ministers will be better when the patrons are better and he defends the right of the clergy to marry and to leave their goods if they have any to their widows and children instead of to the church or to some school or almshouse what if their wives are fond after the decease of their husbands to bestow themselves not so advisedly as their calling requireth do not duchesses countesses and knights wives offend in the like fully so often as they and eve remarks the old philosopher of radwinter eve will be eve though adam would say nay the apparel of and decent than it ever was in the popish church when the priests went either in divers colors like players or in garments of light hue as yellow red green etc with their shoes piked their hair crisped their girdles armed with silver their shoes spurs bridles etc buckled with like metal their apparel for the most part of silk and richly furred their caps laced and buttoned with gold so that to meet a priest in those days was to behold a peacock that spreadeth his tail when he danceth before the hen hospitality among the clergy was never better used and it was increased by their marriage for the meat and drink were prepared more orderly and frugally the household was better looked to and the poor oftener fed there was perhaps less feasting of the rich in bishops houses and it is thought much peradventure that some bishops in our time do come short but this is owing to the curtailing of their livings and the excessive prices whereunto things are grown harrison spoke his mind about dignitaries he makes a passing reference to thomas a becket as the old cocke of canturburie who did crow in behalf of the see of rome and the young cockerels of other sees did imitate his demeanour he is glad that images shrines and tabernacles are removed out of churches the stories in glass windows remain only because of the cost of replacing them with white panes he would like to stop the wakes guilds paternities church ales and brides ales with all their rioting and he thinks they could get on very well without the feasts of apostles evangelists martyrs the holy days after christmas easter and whitsuntide and those of the virgin mary with the rest it is a world to see he wrote of how ready the catholicks are to cast the communion call oysterboards and to set up altars whereon to say mass and he tells with sinful gravity this tale of a sacrilegious sow upon the rd of august the high altar of christ church in oxford was trimly decked up after the popish manner and about the middest of evensong a sow cometh into the quire and pulled all to the ground for which heinous fact it is said she was afterwards beheaded but to that i am not privy think of the condition of oxford when pigs went to mass four years after this there was a sickness in england of which a third part of the people did taste and many clergymen who had prayed not to live after the death of queen mary had their desire the lord hearing their prayer says harrison and intending thereby to give his church a breathing time there were four classes in england gentlemen citizens yeomen and artificers or laborers besides the nobles live without work and buy a coat of arms though some of them bear a bigger sail than his boat is able to sustain the complaint of sending abroad youth to be educated is an old one harrison says the sons of gentlemen went into italy and brought nothing home but mere atheism infidelity vicious conversation and ambitious proud behavior and retained neither religion nor patriotism among citizens were the merchants of whom harrison thought there were too many for like the lawyers they were no furtherance to the commonwealth but raised the price of all commodities in former free trade times sugar was sixpence a pound now it is two shillings sixpence raisins were one penny and now
was not so bad as this everybody came running to see what the matter was and joanna picked her up and carried her into aunt zelie s room where it was found that a large lump on her head and a bruise on her arm were the worst of her injuries bess told how it happened i ca nt think what ails carl lately said louise he is a mean hateful boy sobbed helen i do nt care if i did spoil his composition feeling that it would be of no use to talk to her then aunt zelie left her to the tender ministrations of her sisters and joanna and went to seek the chief offender he was still in the girls room standing had hurt helen badly had passed and the sight of his composition stirred his anger afresh is it true that you threw your sister down his aunt stood before him with a look in her dark eyes which it was not pleasant to meet carl glanced down but answered yes and here is what she did holding up the blotted paper does that excuse your unmanliness your you might have killed her you know i ca nt talk to you now carl you d better go to your room i ca nt tell you how disappointed i am he never thought of not following her suggestion indeed he was glad to get away from those indignant eyes of course he muttered to himself i am all to blame and nothing is said to helen about spoiling my work boys are always found fault with but girls can do anything down in his heart he knew this was not flung himself into a chair by the window it was a gloomy thawing day the snow as if aghast at the trouble it had caused was melting sadly away there was nothing in the prospect to make him feel cheerful after awhile he went to work on his composition again and as he wrote he felt more and more like a martyr when it was finished he folded it and put it away and began to think it must be near lunch time with the door closed there in the third story he could not hear the bell however he would not go down if they wanted him they might send for him by two o clock he was feeling deeply injured nobody cared whether he starved or not then he remembered that uncle william was to take them to see hermann that afternoon by this time they must have gone without him carl threw himself on the bed and shed some tears of vexation and disappointment all the while something was the afternoon dragged slowly he grew very hungry and at last saying to himself that he would go and get some biscuit and tom sawyer one of his favorite books he went softly downstairs the house was so quiet that the sight of mr smith asleep on a hall chair was a positive relief after visiting the pantry he went to the library for his book the door was half open and when he reached it he suddenly stopped for there was aunt zelie by the table with her head bowed on her arms evidently she had not heard him and carl almost held his breath he thought she was crying he was not sure but certainly she was unhappy it came to him in that moment as it never had before how tender and sweet and helpful she was she had sorrow of her own he knew and who was there to comfort her as she comforted others and he had disappointed her had behaved shamefully must have been crazy he could not endure the sight of that sorrowful figure and turning to go away instead the next minute he was kneeling beside her saying aunt zelie i am so sorry she was startled for she had not heard him but she turned and put her arms around him for a moment without speaking aunt zelie i know how contemptible i am you ought not to have anything to do with me carl exclaimed in a great burst of contrition she took his hand and held it fast as she answered i ca nt throw stones at you dear but perhaps i can help you to learn the lesson i have had to learn many times he never forgot that afternoon how he sat beside her with his head on her shoulder while she talked to him as she had never talked before how his face glowed with mingled shame and pride as she said that of all dearest to her but i have more fear for you than for the others i long to have you grow up a strong true man master of yourself in every sense if you do not i shall feel that in some way it is my fault i will try to be what you want me to be like uncle carl if i can and nobody in the world could help me as you do illustration he told her about the trouble at school i shall not leave you till you leave me aunt zelie said smiling rather wistfully at the tall boy that will be never and i will always take care of you answered carl laying his cheek against her hand he told her about the trouble at school too finding it a relief to confess everything and she listened gravely for a little misunderstanding like this a little hateful pride pleasant friendships are given up and the good times have my good neighbors forgotten their motto already i m afraid so carl said thinking how hard it would be to make things right again have you told father he asked no he did not come to lunch then i shall have to tell him with a sigh this was not an easy thing to
he stooped down and picked up that which had arrested his attention it was a piece of paper apparently the blank leaf of a letter there was no writing or mark on it to indicate its ownership but had it been the visiting card of fred greenwood hank hazletine could not have been more positive that it belonged to the young man it was impossible that motoza should carry writing paper with him the cowman never did so consequently he could not have dropped it on his late visit it was equally improbable that bill tozer had anything to do with it he knew that both of the boys seen them figuring over some problems they were discussing and with a thrill of conviction he remembered that the paper they used was of precisely the same pattern as the piece he held in his hand the younker has been here but what the mischief has become of him and the mystified cowman looked right and left on the floor and at the roof as if he suspected the youth was hiding in one of those places an explanation suggested itself after taking the lad to the cavern his captor from some cause had changed his mind and transferred him to another place of confinement no there was another theory which would explain the mystery it was that motoza yielding to his implacable enmity of the youth had placed him beyond all reach of his friends the spirit of revenge with an american indian is tenfold stronger than cupidity it was not improbable that the miscreant having committed the unspeakable crime was concealing it from tozer his ally in the for the time he carefully let himself down from the ledge to the rock immediately beneath and began working his way through the canyon to the opening at the break his familiarity stood him in as good stead as before and he reached the place without mishap climbing the steep slope to the higher ground he sat down for a few minutes thought it was well into the night and it was useless to attempt to do anything more he was as firmly resolved however as before not to be outwitted by the ruffians with whom he was dealing he would consent to no attempt to pay them a ransom until he knew beyond peradventure that their part of the contract would be fulfilled if they try any crooked work he muttered with deadly earnestness both of em have got to settle with hank hazletine he gave no thought to jack dudley for he took it for granted that he had been able to look out for known to him he reached the plateau within an hour after the arrival of the youth who had started a fire and was doing his best to dry his clothing and gain some warmth for his chilled body it need not be said that the cowman was interested in the story told by the youth and was astonished beyond measure to learn that both had taken the same route one actually passing the other without either suspecting it on his part hazletine related all that he had passed through and explained the reason of his ascent of the canyon some time before when he was observed by the wondering lads meanwhile where was fred greenwood chapter xix into the cavern hank hazletine and jack dudley having failed to find the missing fred greenwood let us try our hand at the task going back to that afternoon when the elder youth from his concealment on the crest of the ridge fired down into the little herd of antelope grazing in the valley in front of him will be remembered that fred had started along the side of the valley with a view of placing himself beyond the game and rendering the success of himself and friend certain he never dreamed of danger to himself his attention was fixed upon the pretty animals and hungry as he was he felt a sympathy for them knowing that in all probability one of the number would be sacrificed nevertheless he put forth the utmost pains to prevent their taking alarm and there is hardly a doubt that he would have succeeded in his purpose but for the catastrophe which overtook him when half the distance had been passed suddenly while he was stealing forward in a crouching posture a low threatening voice reached his ear only the single word stop was uttered but it could not have startled the youth more than the whir of a rattlesnake under his feet before he could straighten up he turned his head like a flash not a rod distant kneeling with his winchester aimed at him believing that he would press the trigger of his weapon the next moment fred greenwood was transfixed he could only look at his enemy and await the end he was without the power to raise a finger in his own defence drop gun commanded his master the words showed the lad that he had a few minutes at least to live but the drop was on him and he promptly obeyed drop little gun added the sioux who never wavered in keeping his rifle pointed at the chest of the young man fred withdrew his revolver and flung it at his feet he was now without a single firearm an infant could not have been more helpless as yet he had not spoken a word he recalled the warning of jack dudley and knew the ferocious hatred this vagrant redskin held toward him to appeal for mercy would delight the miscreant and not aid the prisoner he tried another tack the question pleased the sioux who partly lowering his rifle still held it ready for instant use his ugly countenance was broken by the old grin huh you call motoza tief eh that s what i called you and that s what you are huh
few weeks father she said i want to know why i may nt go and see other little boys and girls and go to church and go to see the people in the cottages as norah and tom and ruth do chapter vii secrets what makes you ask that question una said her father when we have lived in other countries you have never asked to have little boys and girls to play with or worried about why you may not go and see people and go to church and here you have norah and tom and dan to play with surely that is enough but i did nt know before that little boys and girls at least when i saw other little boys and girls playing with each other i thought they were brothers and sisters or cousins and of course i have nt got any brothers or sisters or cousins of my very own but now that i know what little boys and girls do i do want to go to church and go to tea with them in their houses and do things like them please father let me and una clasped her hands coaxingly as she thought of the dear old lady and gentleman she had been to tea with that afternoon the flower filled garden the yellow honeycomb the gold fish and the black puppy and the cockatoo the old gentleman had promised to show her the next time she came all floated through her brain as she waited for her father s answer but monsieur gen shook his head no dear he said to himself he was thinking that perhaps he had been foolish to allow una to be friends with known that it would make her restless and dissatisfied with the quiet life she had been quite content to live before then he roused himself and looked down kindly at his little girl are you very disappointed poor little una he said putting his arm round her and drawing her to his side do nt look so sad and i will try and explain to you why it is that you have never had little friends and companions of your own age una looked at him still gravely but with the light of a growing interest in her eyes then she fetched a little stool and sat down at her father s feet you must know una dear said her father smiling rather sadly as he looked down at her that each one of us has some kind of work to do in the world we may do it badly or we may do it well or we may not even try to do to try to do something to help our fellow men do you understand little one una nodded yes father i quite understand she said it was not often that her father talked in this way it was rather like listening to the vicar s sermon the only sunday she had ever been to church she thought as she leant her head against her father s knee and monsieur gen went on speaking well dear sometimes people can help each other to do their bits of work in the world and sometimes too they can spoil other people s work and there are some people who are trying very hard to spoil the work which i am doing una sprang to her feet father how dare they she said indignantly horrid people i hate them her father reached out his hand and drew her to him but as long as they can not find out or how i am doing it they can not really spoil my work and that is why i have never made friends with people in any of the different places where we have stayed in case the people who want to spoil my work should try and find out through these new friends who i am and what i am doing and that is why i want you my little una to help me to keep my work as secret as possible oh father i will i will cried una only only i do nt quite see how i can let out a secret if i do nt exactly know what it is i can not tell you all the secret little una said her father at least not until you are older and can understand more about it but if i were to let you make friends and go about wherever you like people would begin to wonder where you came from and who and what i did and although not really knowing my secret you might let out little bits of it until people began to wonder and talk about you and me one can never be too careful he added half to himself yes i understand father said una gravely and she sat at her father s feet looking into the fire and not talking much until the little clock on the mantelpiece struck seven and marie came to tell her that it was bedtime i wonder whether i was wise in telling her so much monsieur gen thought to himself when his little daughter had gone but it seemed the only thing to be done and she is prudent beyond her years poor little lonely girl i do not think she will chatter about anything i have told her for some time after this una was rather quiet and sad more like what she had been when norah and dan first to laugh and play as she had been of late the secret her father had told her weighed heavily on the little girl s mind she was so afraid that she might have let out to her little friends though unknowingly something about her father s work and she was careful now not to say anything which might lead them to ask questions about him one afternoon she was walking
to the man in charge and double quick too the man stared but helena rattled the gold in her pocket and he called to two men to hitch up upon my soul he whispered to his associates it s those kids of jack belmont s and old yorba s or i m a dead man but it ai nt none of my business and i ai nt one to peach i like spirit we re going to the fire and i wish the hack to wait for us said helena as he signified that all was ready i ll pay you now how much is it ten dollars he replied unblushingly helena paid the money like a blood magdalena horrified at the extravagance her own allowance was five dollars a month she asked remonstrantly as the hack slid down the steep hill i got fifty dollars out of jack to night he s feeling awfully soft over my going away poor old jack he ll feel so lonesome without me but we ll have a gay old time travelling together in europe when i m through magdalena did not speak of her conversation with her own parent she did not want to think of it this night was to be one of uniform joy they were a quarter of an hour reaching the fire as they turned into the great central artery of the city market street they leaned forward and gazed eagerly at the dense highly coloured mass of men and women mostly young who promenaded the north sidewalk under a blaze of gas what queer looking girls said magdalena why do they wear so many frizzes and sailor hats on one side they re chippies said helena wisely what s street they work all day and promenade with their beaux all evening as i live lena we re going down fourth street we ll go right through chippytown they had been south of market street before for ila and tiny lived on the aristocratic rincon hill but their way had always lain down second street which was old but stately and respectable fourth street like market street by night would be a new country but after a few moments eager attention helena sniffed with disappointment the narrow street and those branching from it were ill lighted and deserted there was nothing to be seen but low browed shops but there was always the red glare beyond and in a few moments the holocaust burst upon them in all its terrible magnificence they sprang out of the hack and walked rapidly to the edge of the crowd which filled the street in spite of the warning cries of the firemen and the angry shouts of the policemen the fire was dwellings beyond a great furniture factory and innumerable tenements were vanishing like icicles under a hot sun the girls careless of the severe jostling they received stared in fascinated amazement at the red tongues darting among the blackened shells the crashing roofs the black masses of smoke above cut with narrow swords of flame the solid pillar of fire above the factory the futile streams of water the gallant efforts of the firemen magdalena hardly knowing why reflected with deep satisfaction that a fire was even more wonderful at close quarters than when viewed from a distance every detail delighted her but when a clumsy boy stepped on her toes she drew helena into a sand lot opposite where it was less crowded it was then that she noticed for the first time the weeping women gathered about their household goods she stared at them for a moment then shook the rapt helena by the arm look she whispered what is the matter with those absently oh do nt i wish i were on that house with a hose in my hand what a lovely exciting life a fireman s must be then yielding to magdalena s insistence she turned and directed her gaze to the people in the lot behind her oh the poor things she said forgetting the fire they ve been burnt out let s talk to them the two girls approached the unfortunate creatures who were wailing loudly as if at a wake poor devils exclaimed helena i am so glad i have some silver with me and i have nothing to give them thought magdalena bitterly but she was too proud to speak she stared at them her brain a medley of new sensations as helena went about questioning fascinating sympathising giving it was the first time she had seen poverty she had barely heard of its existence condescended to borrow from life it was not abject poverty that she witnessed by any means there were no hollow cheeks here no pallid faces no shrunken limbs it was save for the passing distress to which they were not unaccustomed a very jolly hearty contented poverty their belongings were certainly mean but solid and sufficient nevertheless to magdalena who had been surrounded by luxury from her birth and had rarely been in a street of less importance than her own these commonly clad creatures weeping over their cheap household goods seemed the very dregs of the earth her keen enjoyment fled she was sure she could never be happy again with so much misery in the world if her father would only she recalled his contempt for charities the prohibition he had laid on her mother she determined to pray all night to the virgin to soften his heart when the virgin had been allowed a reasonable time she would beg him to give the virgin had failed her many times but must surely hearken to so worthy a petition as this she stood apart no one noticed her she had nothing to give they were showering blessings upon helena who was walking about with a cocky little stride well pleased with herself suddenly helena wheeled and ran over to magdalena i ve given away
loving gaze it vanished and was gone a wave of colour swept over her face her eyes wavered gave one imploring glance me susan d asked margaret once more n no said susan d in a whisper scarcely audible no and why not dear child i promised whispered susan d susan d do you know anything about that strange noise that frightened us so last night but not another word would susan d say she looked loving imploring deprecating she threw her arms around margaret s neck and hid her face and clung to her but no word could she be brought to say at last margaret displeased and puzzled felt constrained to tell the child rather sternly to fold her work and go away and not come back to her till she could answer questions properly susan went obediently at the door she hesitated and margaret heard a little sigh which made her heart go out in sympathy toward the little creature instantly she rose and going to the child put her arms round puzzled about something she said quickly susan d nodded and clung close to her cousin s side i will not ask you anything more said margaret i am going to trust you susan d not to do anything wrong remember dear that the two most important things in the world are truth and kindness now kiss me dear and go left alone margaret sat for some time puzzling over what had happened and wondering what would happen next it was evident that the children were concerned in some way or at least had some knowledge of the mysterious sounds which had so alarmed miss sophronia what ought she to do how far must she try to force confession from them if it were her duty to try and how could she do it thus pondering she became aware of voices in the air she sat near the open window and the voices were from above her and holding her breath well if you back out now susan d it will be mean basil was saying what did you say to her i did nt say anything susan d answered sullenly why did nt you tell her that we had a pain and did nt want to bother her cause she had company cried merton eagerly i had that all fixed to tell her only she never asked me i would nt tell her a lie said susan d basil you would nt tell her a lie either you know you would nt when she looks at you that way straight at you and you ca nt get your eyes away of course i would nt said basil and the reason she did nt ask you merton was because she knew it would nt make much difference what you said susan if you had only had a little dipplo macy you could have got through all right as i did i do nt know what you mean by dipplo macy retorted susan ho stupid sneered merton i do nt believe you know what it means yourself cried basil come tell now if you are so wise what does it mean ah i knew you did nt know you are a sneak mert well i guess in the beginning when adam was making the words you know he must have wanted to hide from the serpent or something perhaps a hairy mammoth or a megatherium i should nt wonder so he said dip low and then massy for a kind of exclamation you see and spelling gets changed a lot in the course of time you can see that just from one class to another in the grammar school round things managing them without telling lies or truth either you ve got to tell one or the other objected susan d no you have nt either now how did i manage i have just kept out of cousin margaret s way all day so far and i m going to keep out the rest of it i ve been helping willis ever since breakfast and he says i really helped him a great deal and i ll make a farmer yet only i wo nt cause i m going into the navy and now pretty soon i m going in in a tearing hurry and ask her if i can take some lunch and go over to see mr merryweather at the bog cause he is going to give me a lesson in surveying he is he said he would any time i came over and so you see that s all very well night what ll you do then i should like to know easy enough i shall have a headache and she wo nt ask me questions when i have a headache she ll just sit and stroke my head and put me to sleep ho how ll you get your headache have to tell a lie then i guess no sir i wo nt and if you say that again i ll bunt you up against the wall easy enough to get a headache i do nt know whether i shall eat hot doughnuts or just ram my head against the horse chestnut tree till it aches but i ll get the headache you may bet your boots basil she asked you not to say that and you said you would nt well i m sorry i did nt mean to pull out a hair susan d and then i shall remember next time say come on cried merton we ve got lots of things to see to we have to the voices were gone margaret sat still sewing steadily and working many thoughts into her seam it might have been half an hour after this that basil burst into the room breathless and beaming his tow colored hair standing on end oh cousin margaret can i i mean may i go over to
first he but peered within and listened then he stood quiet for a space as if he waited for what we could not tell none of us being sufficiently near to prevent and the power of the demon prevailing over weak and mortal flesh he mounted the curb and amid the most horrid shrieks cursings and revilings proceeding from the foul below wherefrom came only faint groans for a short space thus died pedro d ortez lord of cartillon leaving the task of getting out his body to those vassals who greatly perturbed in spirit gathered at the spot we hastened away horrified at such abominations of beelzebub as we had witnessed being for our fear and little faith made culpable before god and hoping to repurchase peace by great penitence report made and rendered to the most reverend and illustrious father in god laurent abbot of the monastery of vaux this the tenth day of july in the year of grace one thousand five hundred and ninety six signed anselmo di napoli jehan de tours document no concerning raoul d ortez indorsed on back further notes by abbot of vaux in nomine patris et filii et sanctus spiritus amen further facts having come to my knowledge in this the year of grace one thousand five hundred and eighty nine which do most his visitation of the sins of the father upon the children of them who hate him it is deemed meet and proper that they be here set down and perpetuated for that future generations may know the truth therefore be it held in everlasting memory that pedro d ortez the same who has been by me beforementioned as of a profane carnal and blood guilty life living not with the fear of god before his eyes but filled with evil at the instigation of the devil the said pedro having at this period two sons desired that the elder should according to secular law inherit his title and lands he desired also that the younger raoul might enter the armies of the king but raoul nothing loath in so far as the fighting there was concerned lusted yet for the gold and acres which were his father s pedro the elder brother being of a mild and amiable temper designed more for the cloister than the camp raoul and meekness of spirit all of these facts being stated and related to me by brother julian who went betimes to the castle for alms and tithes which same were frequent denied and withheld to the great detriment of our just dues one day after a more than usually violent quarrel between pedro and raoul their father came suddenly upon them in a retired portion of the castle grounds the sight was enough to startle even a man so used to shedding human blood as had been the lord of cartillon pedro was slowly sinking to the ground easing himself down somewhat upon his knees and elbows his brother stood near watching and calmly wiping the red drippings from his sword upon the grass not a semblance of regret did he show for the deed of blood the father gazed transfixed with horror from one son to the other until the slow comprehension came to him how now raoul what hast thou done the older man demanded of raoul canst lordship of this fair domain the younger replied full as sturdily hot and scornful with lowering brow and unrepenting glare thou foul and unnatural murderer and thinkest thou to profit by thy brother s death no i swear hold old man swear not and taint not thy soul with perjury have a care for thine own safety it is now but the feeble barrier of thy tottering age which prevents all these acres these fighting men these towers from being my own have a care i say that thou dost not lie as low as he and by my hand the old man fell back a pace affrighted feeling for the first time in his life a fear fear of his own son yet the scornful and defiant face before him was that of his true child therein he saw reflected his own turbulent and reckless youth the wretched old man covered his face from the sight of pedro his first born repose of death and moaned aloud in his agony nay sorrow not my father raoul commanded harshly it was but a weakling who stood next thy seat of power behold i too am thy son i am stronger of a stouter heart abler and more courageous than he and will make thee a fitter heir didst thou not slay thy brother to sit in his hall didst not thou hang him to drink his wine to command his servants have i done aught but follow thy example heedless of his father s sobs raoul pursued his unrelenting purpose what the sword did for thee it has done for me all glory to the sword and he raised the reeking blade to his lips to kiss the elder man shrank away from him as he approached nay as i tell thee draw not thy hand away turn not from me or by the blood of christ beside thy woman son the puny changeling whose face now is scarce paler than his blood was thin now by the god who made ye swear twill be given out as but an accident and no man will ever know from thee the truth i swear i swear the old man repeated piteously after his son and so it came to be that raoul the second son succeeded his father as lord of cartillon and thus is the promise of the lord god made true document no concerning the making of the locket extracts from the statement of miguel siliceo goldsmith of san estevan de gormaz as given in presence of brothers jehan and hubert only such portions being here set out
saw you first to invite you maurice met the girl s smiling eyes and the ice of her hand as soon as i saw you come in last night i knew she was the other woman you did nt look at me i can see with my eyelashes do you know i have often thought i should love her if i were a man there was not a trace of jealousy in lily s gentle and perfect manner you resemble her said maurice you have the blond head and the same features only a little more delicate i have been in her parlor all morning said lily we talked about you i am certain maurice mrs carstang is in her heart still faithful to you that she should thrust the old love on him as a kind of solace seemed the cruelest of all there was no cognizance of anything except this one maddening girl she absorbed him she wrung the strength of his manhood from him as tribute such tribute as everybody a rock tranced by the strong control which he kept over himself i must go said lily she had not sat down at all maurice shuffled his papers good bye she spoke good bye he answered she did not ask are you coming down the trail with me but ebbed softly away the swish of her silken petticoat subsiding on the grassy avenue her lover stretched his arms across the desk and sobbed upon them with heart broken gasps it is killing me it is killing me and there is no escape if i took my life my disembodied ghost would follow her less able to make itself felt than now i can not live without her and she is not for me not for me he cursed the necessity which drove him out with the sailing party and the prodigal waste of life on neutral trivial doings which can not be called living he could see lily keeping down a wild beast in him which desired to toss overboard the men who crowded around her she was more deliciously droll than any comedienne full of music and wit the kind of spirit that rises flood tide with occasion he was himself hilarious also during this experience of sailing with two queens surrounded by courtiers and playing the deep game of fascination as if men were created for the amusement of their lighter moments lily s defiant inscrutable eyes mocked him but mrs carstang gave him sweet friendship and he sat by her with the unchanging loyalty of a devotee to an altar from which the sacrament has been removed next morning lily did not come to the lime kiln maurice worked furiously all day and corrected proof in his room at night though tableaux were shown in the casino both mrs carstang and lily being head and front of the undertaking the second day lily did not come to the limekiln but he saw her pass along the grassy avenue in front of his of them they waved their hands to him maurice sat with his head on his desk all the afternoon beaten and broken hearted he told himself he was a poltroon that he was losing his manhood that the one he loved despised him and did well to despise him that a man of his age who gave way to such weakness must be entering senility the habit of rectitude would cover him like armor and proclaim him still of a chivalry to which he felt recreant but it came upon him like revelation that many a man had died of what doctors had called disease when the report to the health officer should have read this man loved a woman with a great passion and she slew him the sigh of the woods around and the sunlight searching for him through his door were lonelier than illimitable space it was what the natives call a real mackinac day with infinite splendor of sky and water maurice heard the rustle came through the white waste of stones she stopped and gazed at him with large hunted eyes and submitted to his taking and kissing her hands it was so blessed to have her at all that half his trouble fled before her they sat down together on the bench much of his life maurice had been in the attitude of judging whether other people pleased him or not lily reversed this habit of mind and made him humbly solicitous to know whether he pleased her or not he silently thanked god for the mere privilege of having her near him passionate selfishness was chastened out of him one can say much behind the lips and make no sound at all if i drench her with my love and she does not know it thought maurice it can not annoy her let me take what she is willing to give and ask no more the carstangs are gone said lily yes i bade them good bye this you do nt say you regret their going i never seek mrs carstang he sat holding the girl s hands and never swerving a glance from her face which was weirdly pallid the face of her spirit he felt himself enveloped and possessed by her his will subject to her will he said within himself voicelessly i love you i love the firm chin the wilful lower lip and the cupid s bow of the upper lip i love the oval of your cheeks the curve of your ears the etched eyebrows and all the little curls on your temples i love the proud nose and most beautiful forehead every blond hair on that dear head is mine its upward tilt on the long throat is adorable have you any gesture or personal trait which does not thrill me but best of all because through them you yourself look at me revealing more than you think i
for a moment and when he looked back she was close to him with the infantile smile on her face candor and sanity in her gray eyes involuntarily he extended his arms and she nestled within them you will be married freda he said you will be married and to me he held her tightly and kissed her lips but the kiss ended in a crashing sound and a shock of pain in his whole body which expelled the breath from his lungs the moonlit island in a blaze of light which gave way to pitchy darkness with rain on his face and whistling wind in his ears while he clung with both arms not to a girl but to a hard wet and cold mizzentopgallant yard whose iron jack stay had bumped him severely between the eyes below him in the darkness a scream rang out followed by the roar of the mate are you all right up there want any help he had fallen four feet when he could speak he answered i m all right sir and catching the royal foot rope dangling from the end of the yard above him he brought it to its place passed the seizing and finished furling the royal but it was a long job his movements were uncertain for every nerve in his body was jumping in its own inharmonious key what s the matter wi you up there demanded the mate when he reached the deck and was nothing sir i forgot about the foot rope you re a bigger lunkhead than i thought go forrard he went and when he came aft at four bells to take his trick at the wheel the girl was still on deck standing near the companionway facing forward the mate stood at the other side of the binnacle looking at her with one elbow resting on the house there was just light enough from the cabin skylight for owen to see the expression which came over his face as he watched the graceful figure balancing to the heave of the ship it took on the same evil look which he had seen in his fall while there was no mistaking the thought behind the gleam in his eyes the mate looked up into owen s face and saw something there which he must have understood for he dropped his glance to the compass snarled out keep her on the course and stepped into down on the house hid him from view the girl approached the man at the wheel i saw you fall mr owen she said in a trembling voice and i could not help screaming were you hurt much no miss folsom he answered in a low though not a steady tone but i was sadly disappointed i confess i was nervous very nervous when you went aloft she said and i cleared away the life buoy then when you fell it slipped out of my hand and went overboard mr adams scolded me was nt it ridiculous there were tears and laughter in the speech not at all he said gravely it saved my life for which i thank you how why who in sam hill s been casting off these gripe lashings growled the voice of the mate behind the dinghy at the wheel where she patted the moving spokes pretending to assist him in steering miss freda said the officer sternly as he came around the corner of the house i must ask you plainly to let things alone and another thing please do nt talk to the man at the wheel will you please mind your own business she almost screamed and then crying and laughing together if you paid as much attention to your work as you do to to me men would nt fall from aloft on account of rotten foot ropes the abashed officer went forward grumbling about discipline and women aboard ship when he was well out of sight in the darkness the girl turned suddenly passed both arms around owen s neck exerted a very slight pressure patted him playfully on the shoulder as she withdrew them and sped down the companionway he steered a wild course during he received from the mate needs must when the devil drives hogged at bow and stern her deck sloped at the ends like a truck s platform while a slight twist in the old hull canted the foremast to port and the mizzen to starboard it would be hard to know when she was on an even keel the uneven planking inboard and out was scarred like a chopping block possibly from a former and intimate acquaintance with the coal trade aloft were dingy gray spars slack hemp rigging untarred for years and tan colored sails mended with patch upon patch of lighter hued canvas that seemed about to fall apart from their own weight she was english built bark rigged bluff in the bow square in the stern unpainted and leaky on the whole as unkempt and disreputable looking a craft as ever flew the black flag and with the clank of the pumps marking time to the wailing squeak of the tiller ropes she wallowed through the waves like a log in an eddying tideway makeshift slovenly air it was a square section of the bark s foreroyal painted black around the skull and cross bones design which had been left the original hue of the canvas the port holes were equally slovenly in appearance being cut through between stanchions with axes instead of saws and the bulwarks were further disfigured by extra holes smashed through at the stanchions to take the lashings of the gun breechings but the guns were bright and cared for as were the uniforms of the crew for they had been lately transhipped far from home with a general cargo this ancient trader had been taken in a fog by captain swarth and his men an
of the engraving when we opened locust avenue from the cemetery west to alexander s dairy was i not a member of the committee appointed to present the petition to the councilmen that s a member of the league of american wheelmen and now i am a candidate for director of our new four hole golf club also i play whist on the train with a man who once lived in the same house with t dewitt talmage hearing these words the a d t kid ceased weeping and cheerfully proceeded up an alley where he played wood tag moral as the twig is bent the tree is inclined the fable of the base ball fan who took the only known cure once upon a time a base ball fan lay on his death bed he had been a rooter from the days of underhand pitching it was simply pie for him to tell in what year anse began to play with the rockfords and what kelly s batting average was the year he sold for ten thousand if you asked him who played center for boston in he could tell you quick right off the reel and he was a walking directory of all the glass arms in the universe more at the umpire and then yelled robber until his pipes gave out for many summers he would come home one evening after another with his collar melted and tell his wife that the giants made the colts look like a lot of colonial dames playing bean bag in a weedy lot back of an orphan asylum and they ought to put a trained nurse on third and the dummy at right needed an automobile and the new man could nt jump out of a boat and hit the water and the short stop would nt be able to pick up a ball if it was handed to him on a platter with water cress around it and the easy one to third that ought to have been sponge cake was fielded like a one legged man with st vitus dance trying to do the nashville salute illustration the fan of course she never knew what he was talking about but she put up with it year after year mixing throat gargle for him and reading the games had to wear a green shade at last he came to his ninth inning and there were two strikes called and no balls and his friends knew it was all day with him they stood around and tried to forget that he was a fan his wife wept softly and consoled herself with the thought that possibly he would have amounted to something if there had been no national game she forgave everything and pleaded for one final message his lips moved she leaned over and listened he wanted to know if there was anything in the morning papers about the condition of bill lange s knee moral there is a specific bacillus for every classified disease the fable of the good fairy with the lorgnette and why she got it good once upon a time there was a broad girl who had nothing else to do and no children to look after so she thought she would be benevolent she had scared all the red corpuscles out of the by midget who rotated about as her husband he was soft for her and so she got it mapped out with herself that she was a superior woman she knew that when she switched the current on to herself she used up about ohms an hour and the whole neighborhood had to put on blinders she had read about nine subscription books with cupid and dove tail pieces and she believed that she could get away with any topic that was batted up to her and then slam it over to second in time to head off the runner her clothes were full of pin holes where she had been hanging medals on herself and she used to go in a hand ball court every day and throw up bouquets letting them bounce back and hit her illustration the midget also she would square off in front of a camera every two weeks and the man was next for he always removed the mole when he was touching up the negative in the photograph the broad girl resembled pauline hall but outside of she showed up on the level she looked like a street just before they put on the asphalt but never you fear she thought she had julia arthur and mary mannering seventeen up and one to play so far as good looks were concerned and when it came to the gray matter the cerebrum the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata may wright sewall was back of the flag and pulled up lame the down trodden man whom she had dragged to the altar sized her all right but he was afraid of his life he was nt strong enough to push her in front of a cable car and he did nt have the nerve to get a divorce so he stood for everything but in the summer when she skated off into the woods to hear a man with a black alpaca coat lecture to the high foreheads about the subverted ego he used to go out with a few friends and tell them his troubles and weep into his beer she was a nice woman but he knew better annyhow as bobby gaylor used to say she became restless around the house with nothing to do except her husband so she made up her mind to be benevolent to beat the band she decided that she would allow the glory of her presence to burst upon the poor and the uncultured it would be a big help to the poor and uncultured to see what a real razmataz lady was like she did nt propose to
marion cried after him and thank you a thousand times he turned again and looked back at them but in their rejoicing they had already forgotten him bless you my children he said smiling girl came down the passage toward it and as she was apparently going to carroll s rooms the actor left the door open behind him neither marion nor carroll had noticed his final exit they were both gazing at each other as though could they find speech they would ask if it were true it s come at last marion philip said with an uncertain voice i could weep cried marion philip she exclaimed i would rather see that play succeed than any play ever written and i would rather play that part in it than oh philip she ended i m so proud of you and rising she threw her arms about his neck and sobbed on his shoulder carroll raised one of her hands and kissed the tips of her fingers gently i owe it to you marion he said all to you this was the tableau that was presented on her errand of restitution and good will and with philip s ring and watch clasped in her hand they had not heard her nor did they see her at the door so she drew back quickly and ran along the passage and down the stairs into the street she did not need now to analyze her feelings they were only too evident for she could translate what she had just seen as meaning only one thing that she had considered philip s love so lightly that she had not felt it passing away from her until her neglect had killed it until it was too late and now that it was too late she felt that without it her life could not go on she tried to assure herself that only the fact that she had lost it made it seem invaluable but this thought did not comfort her she was not deceived by it she knew that at last she cared for him deeply and entirely in her distress she blamed herself bitterly but she also blamed philip no he might have known that i must love him in time she repeated to herself again and again she was so unhappy that her letter congratulating philip on his good fortune in having his comedy accepted seemed to him cold and unfeeling and as his success meant for him only what it meant to her he was hurt and grievously disappointed he accordingly turned the more readily to marion whose interests and enthusiasm at the rehearsals of the piece seemed in contrast most friendly and unselfish he could not help but compare the attitude of the two girls at this time when the failure or success of his best work was still undecided he felt that as helen took so little interest in his success he could not dare to trouble her with his anxieties concerning it and she attributed his silence to his preoccupation and interest in marion so the two grew apart each misunderstanding the other and each troubled in spirit at the other s indifference the first night of the play justified all was a great personal triumph for the new playwright the audience was the typical first night audience of the class which charles wimpole always commanded it was brilliant intelligent and smart and it came prepared to be pleased from one of the upper stage boxes helen and lady gower watched the successful progress of the play with an anxiety almost as keen as that of the author to helen it seemed as though the giving of these lines to the public these lines which he had so often read to her and altered to her liking was a desecration it seemed as though she were losing him indeed as though he now belonged to these strange people all of whom were laughing and applauding his words from the german princess in the royal box to the straight backed tommy in the pit instead of the painted scene before her she saw the birch trees by the river at home where he had first read her the speech to which they were now listening so intensely the speech in which the hero tells the girl he had thought how wonderful it would be if some day some one made such a speech to her not philip but a man she loved and now if philip would only make that speech to her now he came out at last with wimpole leading him and bowed across a glaring barrier of lights at a misty but vociferous audience that was shouting the generous english bravo and standing up to applaud he raised his eyes to the box where helen sat and saw her staring down at the tumult with her hands clasped under her chin her face was colorless but lit with the excitement of the moment and he saw that she was crying lady gower from behind her was clapping her hands delightedly but my dear helen she remonstrated breathlessly you never told me he was so good looking yes said helen rising abruptly he is very good looking she crossed the box to where her cloak was hanging but folds my dear child cried lady gower in dismay what is it the excitement has been too much for you no i am just happy sobbed helen i am just happy for him we will go and tell him so then said lady gower i am sure he would like to hear it from you to night philip was standing in the centre of the stage surrounded by many pretty ladies and elderly men wimpole was hovering over him as though he had claims upon him by the right of discovery but when philip saw helen he pushed his way toward her eagerly and took her hand in both

them to the tree in confirmation and illustration of the fact he then carefully deposited the paint pot in a secret place where it might be out of sight and touch of a certain searching eye and mischievous hand well known and feared of him but before the setting sun had dropped below the line of purple mountain tops a small boy who will be known in these annals as dicky winship might have been seen sitting on the empty paint pot while from a dingy pool upon the ground he was attempting to paint a copy of the aforesaid inscription upon the side of a too patient goat who saw no harm in the operation he was alone and very very happy all this began you may not realise it dear young folks but this method of telling a story is very much the fashion with grown up people and of course i am not to blame since i did nt begin it the plan is this you must first write a chapter showing all your people men women children dogs and cats in a certain place doing certain things then you must go back a year or two and explain how they all happen to be there perhaps you may have to drag your readers twenty five years into the regions of the past and show them the first tooth of your oldest character but that does nt matter a bit the further the better then when everybody has forgotten what came to pass in the first chapter you are ready to take it up again as if there had never been any parenthesis however i shall not introduce you to the cradles cribs or trundle beds to retrace your steps one week and look upon them in their homes on one of the pleasantest streets of a certain little california town stood and still stands for aught
a fool to quarrel with this fellow he was another of the school time playmates dispatch to his wife he was tormented by the stern words of the young orphan s telegram i act under his last wishes find randall clayton dead or alive there is trouble ahead mused ferris and i have made enemies of all the officials here but alice is mine i hold her in the hollow of my hand my wife that she can not gainsay when he had sent off his message he felt strangely cheered by the reflection that worthington probably left ten to fifteen millions behind him there s enough for all he cheerily reflected i ll let her play miss millions a bit but when the probate proceedings come up she ll find a husband is a hard thing to deal with he was wandering back to the office determined to remove at once all of his private data and personal effects to the fifth avenue when he stumbled over the policeman on the beat bad business sir this of mr clayton said the stalwart irish american is it true there s twenty five thousand reward out with a sudden inspiration arthur ferris paused mac said he i am deeply interested here i ll give you personally five thousand dollars more for the first clue mind you no publicity the policeman s eyes sparkled word of honor he said yes i ll write it in your presence seal it and give it to you this promise if the clue leads to clayton dead or alive the two men walked along in the streaming crowd ferris felt instinctively that the officer was holding something back what do the reporters say hesitating remarked ferris all in the dark a pack of fools unless it s a crime that gives itself away to any one they know nothing and the force has not picked up was so neatly done what do you mean quickly queried ferris oh any gonoph can see that the man was murdered for the stuff resolutely said mcnerney he was no fellow to clear out his life was clean as a whistle i know all about him how can you prove that hotly said the excited lawyer because all the men on the force from here to his rooms and around town knew him for a clean civil honest steady fellow one in ten thousand thief he never said mcnerney not on your life ferris stopped i will be at the fifth avenue night and day said the vice president either there or at our office you can come to my rooms at your will i ll leave word for your admittance you ll have your money in ten minutes if you turn up any sign down to the corner where he had seen clayton and leah einstein enter the carriage here the poor fellow began his ride to death mused dennis i must have that reward all of it and this fellow s five thousand had he a hand in it i ll spot him from to night but the jew boy has the key of the secret of course he s crafty and cowardly in a month he will throw off his fear when i catch him with that woman i ve got the right scent of the whole thing then i ll hunt up the hack driver the boy is the key and if the force finds out nothing in two weeks the game is mine if the boy is arrested i ll get in with the woman and carriage clue i can wait while jack witherspoon and doctor atwater conferred at the hoffman there was a private meeting at robert wade s mansion which brought together all the brutal treatment announced the policy of a united resistance a joint appeal to hugh worthington and the demand of an investigation committee of directors we will wait for mr worthington s vindication said wade in an unanswerable tone then you will wait until eternity sadly said walter edson here is the ten o clock edition of the evening telegram mr hugh worthington the well known capitalist died at pasco washington this morning from injuries received in a railroad accident when the hubbub had subsided the voice of wade was heard gentlemen we must act in a passive defence until the worthington estate sends in a man to control the situation i shall move that three of us retain lawyers to defend us all and advise us as to our joint course for i apprehend mr arthur ferris will be a king shark if he rules over us while the endangered officials burned the midnight oil the hollow eyed arthur ferris was hidden it was long after midnight when dunham dismissed his nephew he had half pooh poohed away the fears of the young schemer of course the girl is rattled you see no one but you and i know of the marriage it gives you an iron hold upon her she will undoubtedly be advised to let our western friends escort mr worthington s body on to detroit there of course she will be met by the family lawyers after the necessary preliminaries there one of them will escort her on here and i will be within reach she evidently wishes to have the affair of the marriage made public some time later if you made worthington do the right thing about the will and all that you will come out all right but do not cross her wishes you can not spring this marriage on the public without endangering all our interests my lawyers here will look out for the big deal you can bring the estate reduced your wife to a passive mood we three can clue up all the private affairs i will be near you i think you are borrowing trouble as for young witherspoon let him be a little huffy i can soon whip
abundance in every state well drilled men by thousands stood ready for the word to march and the military experience and knowledge given by a great war was yet strong upon of the war appeared a very obvious and a very simple one canada had given the offence canada should be made to pay the penalty in a very short time one hundred thousand two hundred thousand five hundred thousand men if necessary could be made ready for the invasion of canada from platform pulpit stump and editorial office came the cry on to canada at the seat of government however the plan of the war did not appear so obvious so simple throwing a great army into canada was all well enough and that army would probably do well enough but the question which produced hard breathing in the executive branch of the government was the immediate protection of the sea coast atlantic gulf and even pacific in a storm of national indignation war had been declared against a power which at this period of her history had brought up her naval forces to a point double in strength to that of any other country in a nation which comparatively speaking possessed no naval strength at all for some years the united states navy had been steadily improving but this improvement was not sufficient to make it worthy of reliance at this crisis as has been said there was money enough and every ship yard in the country could be set to work to build ironclad men of war but it takes a long time to build ships and england s navy was afloat it was the british keel that america had to fear by means of the continental cables it was known that many of the largest mail vessels of the british transatlantic lines which had been withdrawn upon the declaration of war were preparing in british ports to transport troops to canada it was not impossible that these great steamers might land an army in canada before an american army could be organized and marched to that province it might be that the united states would be forced to defend her borders instead of invading those of the enemy in every iron went on by day and by night but what was to be done when the great ironclads of england hammered upon our defences how long would it be before the american flag would be seen no more upon the high seas it is not surprising that the government found its position one of perilous responsibility a wrathful nation expected of it more than it could perform all over the country however there were thoughtful men not connected with the government who saw the perilous features of the situation and day by day these grew less afraid of being considered traitors and more willing to declare their convictions of the country s danger despite the continuance of the national enthusiasm doubts perplexities and fears began to show themselves in the states bordering upon canada a reactionary feeling became evident unless the united states navy could prevent england from rapidly pouring into canada not only her own troops but perhaps those of allied nations these northern states might become the scene of their lands might be ravished their people suffer from many quarters urgent demands were now pressed upon the government from the interior there were clamours for troops to be massed on the northern frontier and from the seaboard cities there came a cry for ships that were worthy to be called men of war ships to defend the harbours and bays ships to repel an invasion by sea suggestions were innumerable there was no time to build it was urged the government could call upon friendly nations but wise men smiled sadly at these suggestions it was difficult to find a nation desirous of a war with england in the midst of the enthusiasms the fears and the suggestions came reports of the capture of american merchantmen by fast british cruisers these reports made the american people more furious the american government more anxious almost from the beginning of this period of national turmoil a party of gentlemen met daily in one of the large rooms in a hotel in new york all from the great atlantic cities but their number increased by arrivals from other parts of the country until at last they numbered twenty three these gentlemen were all great capitalists and accustomed to occupying themselves with great enterprises by day and by night they met together with closed doors until they had matured the scheme which they had been considering as soon as this work was done a committee was sent to washington to submit a plan to the government these twenty three men had formed themselves into a syndicate with the object of taking entire charge of the war between the united states and great britain this proposition was an astounding one but the government was obliged to treat it with respectful consideration the men who offered it were a power in the land a power which no government could afford to disregard the plan of the syndicate was comprehensive direct and simple it offered to assume the entire control and expense of the war and to effect a this contract would be properly performed an immense sum of money would be deposited in the treasury at washington should the syndicate be unsuccessful this sum would be forfeited and it would receive no pay for anything it had done the sum to be paid by the government to the syndicate should it bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion would depend upon the duration of hostilities that is to say that as the shorter the duration of the war the greater would be the benefit to the country therefore the larger must be the pay to the syndicate according to the proposed contract the syndicate would receive if the war should

a difficult problem produced by david widger a difficult problem by anna katharine green mrs charles rohlfs copyright the f m lupton publishing company a lady to see you sir i looked up and was at once impressed by the grace and beauty of the person thus introduced to me is there anything i can do to serve you i asked rising she cast me a child like look full of trust and candor as she seated herself in the chair i pointed out to her i believe so i hope so she earnestly assured me i i am in great trouble i have just lost my husband but it is not that it is the slip of paper i found on my dresser and which which she was trembling violently and her words were fast becoming incoherent i calmed her and asked her to relate her story just as it had happened and after a sufficiently to respond with some degree of connection and self possession i have been married six months my name is lucy holmes for the last few weeks my husband and myself have been living in an apartment house on fifty ninth street and as we had not a care in the world we were very happy till mr holmes was called away on business to philadelphia this was two weeks ago five days later i received an affectionate letter from him in which he promised to come back the next day and the news so delighted me that i accepted an invitation to the theater from some intimate friends of ours the next morning i naturally felt fatigued and rose late but i was very cheerful for i expected my husband at noon and now comes the perplexing mystery in the course of dressing myself i stepped to my bureau and seeing a small newspaper slip attached to the cushion by a pin i drew it off and read it it was a death notice i took in its fatal and incredible words died this day at the colonnade james forsythe de witt holmes new york papers please copy james forsythe de witt holmes was my husband and his last letter which was at that very moment lying beside the cushion had been dated from the colonnade was i dreaming or under the spell of some frightful hallucination which led me to misread the name on the slip of paper before me i could not determine my head throat and chest seemed bound about with iron so that i could neither speak nor breathe with freedom and suffering thus i stood staring at this demoniacal bit of paper which in an instant had brought the shadow of death upon my happy life nor was i at all relieved when a little later i flew with the notice into a neighbor s apartment and praying her to read it for me found that my eyes had not deceived me and that the name was indeed not from my own mind but from hers came the first suggestion of comfort it can not be your husband who is meant said she but some one of the same name your husband wrote to you yesterday and this person must have been dead at least two days for the printed notice of his decease to have reached new york some one has remarked the striking similarity of names and wishing to startle you cut the slip out and pinned it on your cushion i certainly knew of no one inconsiderate enough to do this but the explanation was so plausible i at once embraced it and sobbed aloud in my relief but in the midst of my rejoicing i heard the bell ring in my apartment and running thither encountered a telegraph boy holding in his outstretched hand the yellow envelope which so often bespeaks death or disaster the sight took my breath away summoning my maid whom i saw hastening towards me from an for me sir i saw in her face before she had read the first line a confirmation of my very worst fears my husband was the young widow choked with her emotions paused recovered herself for the second time and then went on i had better show you the telegram taking it from her pocket book she held it towards me i read it at a glance it was short simple and direct come at once your husband found dead in his room this morning doctors say heart disease please telegraph you see it says this morning she explained placing her delicate finger on the word she so eagerly quoted that means a week ago wednesday the same day on which the printed slip recording his death was found on my cushion do you not see something very strange in this i did but before i ventured to express myself on this subject learned in her visit to philadelphia her answer was simple and straightforward but little more than you find in this telegram he died in his room he was found lying on the floor near the bell button which he had evidently risen to touch one hand was clenched on his chest but his face wore a peaceful look as if death had come too suddenly to cause him much suffering his bed was undisturbed he had died before retiring possibly in the act of packing his trunk for it was found nearly ready for the expressman indeed there was every evidence of his intention to leave on an early morning train he had even desired to be awakened at six o clock and it was his failure to respond to the summons of the bell boy which led to so early a discovery of his death he had never complained of any distress in breathing and we had always considered him a perfectly healthy man but there was no reason for assigning any so the burial certificate was made out

at and her curls loose and powdered with gold well the three drank chocolate in the gazebo and what happened no one knew except that the duke on taking leave gave his cousin a seat in his carriage but the cavaliere never returned winter approaching and the poor lady thus finding herself once more alone it was surmised among her women that she must fall into a deeper depression of spirits but far from this being the case she displayed such cheerfulness and equanimity of humor that my grandmother for one was half vexed with her for giving no more thought to the poor young man who all this time was eating his heart out in the house across the valley it is true she quitted but nencia would have it she looked the lovelier for the change and so gave the duke greater displeasure certain it is that the duke drove out oftener to the villa and though he found his lady always engaged in some innocent pursuit such as embroidery or music or playing games with her young women yet he always went away with a sour look and a whispered word to the chaplain now as to the chaplain my grandmother owned there had been a time when her grace had not handled him over wisely for according to nencia it seems that his reverence who seldom approached the duchess being buried in his library like a mouse in a cheese well one day he made bold to appeal to her for a sum of money a large sum nencia said to buy certain tall books a chest full of them that a foreign pedlar had brought him whereupon the duchess who could never abide a book breaks out at him with holy mother of god must i have more books about me i was nearly smothered with them in the first year of my marriage and the chaplain turning red at the affront she added you may buy them and welcome my good chaplain if you can find the money but as for me i am yet seeking a way to pay for my turquoise necklace and the statue of daphne at the end of the bowling green and the indian parrot that my black boy brought me last michaelmas from the bohemians so you see i ve no money to waste on trifles and as he backs out awkwardly she tosses at him over her shoulder you should pray to saint blandina to open the duke s pocket to which he returned very quietly your excellency s suggestion is an admirable one and i have already entreated that blessed martyr to open the duke s understanding thereat nencia said who was standing him out of the room and then quick she cried to my grandmother who was too glad to run on such errands call me antonio the gardener s boy to the box garden i ve a word to say to him about the new clove carnations now i may not have told you sir that in the crypt under the chapel there has stood for more generations than a man can count a stone coffin containing a thighbone of the blessed saint blandina of lyons a relic offered i ve been told by some great duke of france to one of our own dukes when they fought the turk together and the object ever since of particular veneration in this illustrious family now since the duchess had been left to herself it was observed she affected a fervent devotion to this relic praying often in the chapel and even causing the stone slab that covered the entrance to the crypt to be replaced by a kneel by the coffin this was matter of edification to all the household and should have been peculiarly pleasing to the chaplain but with respect to you he was the kind of man who brings a sour mouth to the eating of the sweetest apple however that may be the duchess when she dismissed him was seen running to the garden where she talked earnestly with the boy antonio about the new clove carnations and the rest of the day she sat indoors and played sweetly on the virginal now nencia always had it in mind that her grace had made a mistake in refusing that request of the chaplain s but she said nothing for to talk reason to the duchess was of no more use than praying for rain in a drought winter came early that year there was snow on the hills by all souls the wind stripped the gardens and the lemon trees were nipped in the lemon house the duchess kept her room in this black season sitting which was a thing she had never done and praying frequently in the chapel as for the chaplain it was a place he never set foot in but to say mass in the morning with the duchess overhead in the tribune and the servants aching with rheumatism on the marble floor the chaplain himself hated the cold and galloped through the mass like a man with witches after him the rest of the day he spent in his library over a brazier with his eternal books you ll wonder sir if i m ever to get to the gist of the story and i ve gone slowly i own for fear of what s coming well the winter was long and hard when it fell cold the duke ceased to come out from vicenza and not a soul had the duchess to speak to but her maid servants and the gardeners about the place yet it was wonderful my grandmother said how she kept her brave colors prayed longer in the chapel where a brazier was kept burning for her all day when the young are denied their natural pleasures they turn often enough to religion and it was a mercy as my grandmother said
his gaze and found her eyes on tonga s shore i reigned a chief and now i am a beggar at your mercy then the young pride mounting to his cheek he cried nay but i jested for i come so far to green kambara for a lordly bowl fit for the kava of a chief she smiled and with the smile malua felt the blood leap in his heart his heart inviolate never before so stirred neath woman s eyes come then with me said taka and the beach stretched from their feet a ribbon that should bind in its white length the heaven to the earth with delicate step she led him to the hut where old akau gave him kindly greeting a little in the shadow where the gourds and strange sweet herbs soft musty fragrances hung swinging from the beams about her head and lightly folded on her golden breast her two hands lay like flowers in the light bright as a sun god sat malua listening with greatest reverence to the aged man who spoke to him of ancient long dead things while he displayed his wealth of burnished cups out of the splendid eld my son he said yours is dim future mine the deathless past heroes have died for me and yet shall die and all the glory of the virgin earth yields up its sweets to me for now i rest and stretch my withered sinews in the sun and wait for peaceful death because your lips are innocent and dawn is in your eyes i give you of my store the fairest treasure after my taka you have won my heart in his strong hand he laid a bowl for this the ages had paid toll soft lightnings shone from its brown glory carved most royally he raised the kava bowl aloft as a spear shivered the dusk where taka stood the light lay on her swelling throat and showed her eyes starred like a tropic night the stranger s hand trembled a little and his quick drawn breath carried a message from his breast to hers they left the hut together from the clear bright heat of noon they turned and took their way into the greenly silent forest leaves flickered above wet blossoms simple sounds of homely labor borne upon the breeze made them the more alone they spoke of love a mighty word to ease the strange new pain born in their hearts sudden the path grew wide a little space deprived of flowers and life the house of sandal wood said taka pointing and there the last home of a chief it lay white shells and snowy pebbles girt him round in his great mould of clay and all his spears and clubs of war kept vigil showing still his might in battle shrill the parrot s to withdraw their shadows from the place sacred to death the violent crime of war a little shadow darkened taka s heart could this sweet world contain both death and love she sought malua s eyes to be assured that love lives always he had gone before to hold the leaves for her to pass and softly she came and like a golden butterfly her small hand fluttered down upon his arm he caught his breath as tho the leaping blood that fled before this touch were very flame then slowly slowly turned and in her eyes gave up his heart s desire no word was said she knew not that she loved he only knew she was the moon of women but their hearts wiser than they had flowered into one then as she passed beneath the swinging leaves he caught the wreath wherewith on tonga s shore the maids had crowned him king of love and beauty and cast it from him with a high disdain laughed to see it and her step was light along the flowery way love in this land grows into perfect stature as the swift sweet growth of nature in these gracious souls love stood full armed godlike from birth their lips whispered of life and laughter but their hearts singing together told each other clear ah love dear love there is no need to say catch up life s song its lightest merriest word pledge deep the golden sun the breeze and bird draw down long lashes over happy eyes that none may guess the light that in them lies nor with what secret smile your lips are stirred the moonlight is so short so long the day nay love dear love there is no need to say the whole world laughed with flowers overhead the sky a hollow sapphire ached with blue the green bright sea gave jewels to the sun and all the air was love that in the midst two radiant gods with brave wide eyes and hair crowned with the beatific spring they stood taka the fair and young malua fierce passionate hearted youth and passionate youth faltering before her innocent gaze he cried dare i adore so crystal clear she seemed a silver dewdrop in the rose of dawn and taka trembling how can he be mine so strong so fair a god with heart of flame and so they strove against their hearts and lived long lives of hope and fear and love s sweet pain within a heart beat but the time was near there in mid forest rimmed with leaves jade green all singing in the sun as deep and brown as taka s eyes the pool disclosed itself across the clear light of the morning showers of fiery jewels shone against the trees rubies bright sapphires purple amethyst topaz fierce opal grass green emeralds flitting bird or bird made flower they seemed to eyes newborn upon a world of love the air was heavy with strange scents the old familiar perfumes seemed so rarely sweet the jasmine was the very breath of love
with one of the new legions that they will doubtless raise and you will believe an old man who says that it is not well for a soldier in the field to have a young wife at home sergius flushed and was silent lest his answer should savour of pride or disrespect toward an elder suddenly they became conscious of a commotion in the street shrill cries were borne to their ears and a moment later blows fell upon the outer door followed by the grinding noise as it turned upon its pivots a freedman burst into the atrium titus staff as if to punish the unceremonious intrusion then he noted the excitement under which the man seemed to be labouring and stood stern and silent to learn what news could warrant such a breach of decorum it is maharbal they say and the speaker s voice came almost in gasps maharbal and the numidians not at the gates cried both young men springing to their feet but the other shook his head and went on no not that not yet but he has cut up four thousand cavalry in umbria with caius centenius the consul had sent them from gaul be silent commanded the elder torquatus surely i hear the public crier in the street is he not summoning the senate velo he said turning to the freedman you are pardoned for your intrusion go now and bear orders from me to arm my household and that my clients and freedmen wait upon me in call for every man and though i fear titus manlius torquatus can not strike the blows he struck in sicily yet even his sword might avail to pierce light armour and he is happy in that he can give those to the state whose muscles shall suffice to drive the point through heavy buckler and breastplate shall it be permitted that i attend you to the senate house asked caius his father inclined his head and donning the togas which slaves had brought they hurried into the street hardly noting that sergius had reseated himself and was gazing absently down into the water counting the ripples that spread from where each threadlike stream fell from its dolphin mouth source he did not know how long he had sat thus nor was he perhaps altogether conscious of his motive in failing to pay the aged senator the honour of accompanying him at least so far as the gates of the temple of concord sounds came to his ears from the apartments above of velo s delivery of his patron s commands then a woman s laugh rang through the passage that led back to the garden of the peristyle sergius rose and turned just as a girl sprang out into the atrium looking back with a laughing challenge to some one who seemed to pursue her but who hesitated to issue from the protecting darkness what do you fear minutia she cried my father and caius have gone and there is no one oh suddenly she became conscious of sergius presence and her olive cheeks flushed to a rich crimson then she faced him with an air of pretty defiance and went on no one here but lucius sergius fidenas who should have business elsewhere sergius said nothing but continued to stand with eyes fixed thoughtfully upon her face her figure was tall slender and very graceful her hair and eyes were dark and her features delicate and perfectly moulded over all was forgetfulness of serious things that only comes to young girls his attentive silence seemed at last to disturb her an annoyed look drove the smile from her lips and with an almost imperceptible side motion of her small head she went on surely lucius sergius fidenas has not allowed my father to go to the senate house with only caius to attend him lucius respects my father too much for that and too disinterestedly it is an even more serious omission than his failure to attend the consul at trasimenus sergius eyes blazed at the taunt and struggling with the answer that rose to his lips he said nothing for fear he might say too much the girl watched him closely her mirth returned a little at the sight of his confusion and with her mirth came something of mercy oh to be sure his wound i almost forgot that tell me my brave lucius did the gauls bite hard when they caught you to tanes how funny for naked gauls to ambush roman legionaries and chase them home father has not spoken to uncle cneus since he says it was his duty to have remained on the field and i suppose he thinks it was yours too instead of running away like a fox to be shut up in his hole sergius had recovered his composure now but his brow was clouded you are as cruel as ever marcia he said and yet i know you have heard that it was the men of my maniple who carried me away senseless from the blow of a dead man oh you did kill him i remember now she resumed with some display of interest you had run him through had you not and he just let his big sword drop on your head i got caius to show me about it and i was the gaul caius did not stab me but had a sore head for two days i meant it for you because you are trying to make an old woman of me when i am hardly a girl marcia began lucius but she raised her hand warningly and went on do you want me to tell you why my father will not let you marry me now there are two reasons one because i do nt want him to and another because he thinks you must do something great to wipe out the stain of a roman centurion s
more but some mysterious force conveyed to his mind a perfect portrait of swearengen jones in the act of putting down a large black mark against him and he forbore i wish i knew whether i had to abide by the new york or the montana standard of extravagance brewster said to himself i wonder if he ever sees the new york papers late each night the last of the grand old brewster family went to his bedroom where after dismissing his man he settled down at his desk with a pencil and a pad of paper lighting the candles which were more easily managed he found than lamps and much more costly day nopper harrison and elon gardner had the receipts for all moneys spent and joe bragdon was keeping an official report but the chief as they called him could not go to sleep until he was satisfied in his own mind that he was keeping up the average for the first two weeks it had been easy in fact he seemed to have quite a comfortable lead in the race he had spent almost in the fortnight but he realized that the greater part of it had gone into the yearly and not the daily expense account he kept a profit and loss entry in his little private ledger but it was not like any other account of the kind in the world what the ordinary merchant would have charged to loss he jotted down on the profit side and he was continually looking for opportunities to swell the total rawles who had been his grandfather s butler since the day after he landed in new greatly to the wrath and confusion of the latter s aunt emmeline the chef came from paris and his name was detuit ellis the footman also found a much better berth with monty than he had had in the house on the avenue aunt emmeline never forgave her nephew for these base and disturbing acts of treachery as she called them one of monty s most extraordinary financial feats grew out of the purchase of a automobile he blandly admitted to nopper harrison and the two secretaries that he intended to use it to practice with only and that as soon as he learned how to run an auto as it should be run he expected to buy a good sensible durable machine for his staff officers frequently put their heads together to devise ways and means of curbing monty s reckless extravagance they were worried he s like a sailor in port protested harrison money is no object if he wants a thing and damn it wo nt last long gardner said reassuringly like his namesake monte cristo the world is his just now and he wants to enjoy it he wants to get rid of it it seems to me whenever they reproached brewster about the matter he disarmed them by saying now that i ve got money i mean to give my friends a good time just what you d do if you were in my place what s money for anyway but this a plate dinner i m going to give a dozen of them and even then i ca nt pay my just debts for years i ve been entertained at people s houses and have been taken cruising on their yachts they have always been bully to me and what have i ever done for them nothing now that i can afford it i am going to return some of those favors and square myself does nt it sound reasonable in addition to what he called his efficient corps of gentlemanly aids he had secured the services of mrs dan demille as social mentor and utility chaperon mrs demille was known in the papers as the leader of the fast younger married set she was one of the cleverest and best looking young women in town and her husband was of those who did not have to be invited too mr demille lived at the club and visited his home some one said that he was so slow and his wife so fast that when she invited him to dinner he usually was two or three days late altogether mrs demille was a decided acquisition to brewster s campaign committee it required just her touch to make his parties fun instead of funny it was on october th that the dinner was given with the skill of a general mrs dan had seated the guests in such a way that from the beginning things went off with zest colonel drew took in mrs valentine and beautiful miss valentine were side by side and no one could say he looked unhappy mr cromwell went in with mrs savage and the same delicate tact in some cases it was almost indelicate was displayed in the disposition of other guests somehow they had come with the expectation of being bored curiosity prompted them to accept but it did not prevent the subsequent inevitable lassitude socially monty brewster had yet to make himself felt he and his dinners were something to talk about but they were accepted hesitatingly haltingly people wondered how he had secured the cooperation of mrs dan but then mrs dan always did go in for a new toy to her was inevitably attributed whatever success the dinner achieved and it was no small measure yet there was nothing startling about the affair monty had decided to begin conservatively he did the conventional thing but he did it well he added a touch or two of luxury the faintest aroma of splendor pettingill had designed the curiously and arranged its decoration of great lavender orchids and lacy butterfly festoons of white ones touched with yellow he had wanted to use dahlias in their many rich shades from pale yellow to orange and deep red but monty held out for orchids it was the artist too who
the ruined walls of a castle and set his pack down beside him to rest after the fatigues of his journey this is looking round and these dark yew trees conceal it very well from the road i shall come here always in the middle of the day when the sun is too hot and count over my gains how hard my mistress the lizard makes me work who would have thought she would have wished to deck her green head with opals down there where there are only a tribe of brown gnomes to see her but i have not given her that one out of the ring which i stole nor three others that i conjured out of the crozier of the priest as i knelt at the altar and they thought i was rehearsing a prayer to the virgin after resting some time the pedlar took up his pack and went boldly on to the gardens never doubting but that hulda was dead but it so happened that at that moment hulda and her mother sat at work in a shady part of the garden under some elder trees what is the matter the bird pecked her wrist and fluttered its wings and opened its beak as if it were very much frightened let us go mother and look about us said hulda so they both got up and wandered all over the gardens but the pedlar in the meantime had walked on toward the town and they saw nothing of him sing to me my sweet bird said hulda that night as she lay down to sleep tell me why you pecked my wrist then the bird sang to her who came from the ruin the ivy clad ruin with old shaking arches all moss overgrown where the flitter bat hideth the limber snake glideth and chill water drips from the slimy green stone who did asked hulda not the pedlar surely tell me my pretty bird but the bird only chirped a little and fluttered its golden wings so hulda ceased the bird woke her by pecking her wrist very early almost before sunrise and sang who dips a brown hand in the chill shaded water the water that drips from a slimy green stone who flings his red cap at the owlets that flap their white wings in his face as he sits there alone hulda upon hearing this arose in great haste and dressed herself then she went to her father and mother and entreated that they would come with her to the old ruin it was now broad day so they all three set out together it was a very hot morning the dust lay thick upon the road and there was not air enough to stir the thick leaves of the trees which hung overhead they had not gone far before they found themselves in a crowd of people all going toward the castle ruin for there they told hulda the pedlar the famous pedlar from the north who sold such fine wares surprising cleverness child whispered hulda s mother nothing could be more fortunate for us let us mingle with the crowd and get close to the pedlar hulda assented to her mother s wish but the heat and dust together with her own intense desire to rescue the lost wand made her tremble so that she had great difficulty in walking they went among gypsies fruit women peasant girls children travelling musicians common soldiers and laborers the heat increased and the dust and the noise and at last hulda and her parents were borne forward into the old ruin among a rush of people running and huzzaing and heard the pedlar shout to them keep back good people leave a space before me leave a large space between me and you so they pressed back again jostling and crowding each other and left an open space before him from which he looked at them with his cunning black eyes and spring the place was open to the sky and the broken arches and walls were covered with thick ivy and wall flowers the pedlar sat on a large gray stone with his red cap on and his brown fingers adorned with splendid rings and he spread them out and waved his hands to the people with ostentatious ceremony now good people he said without rising from his seat you are about to see the finest rarest and most wonderful exhibition of the conjuring art ever known stop cried a woman s voice from the crowd and a young girl rushed wildly forward from the people who had been trying to hold her back i impeach you before all these witnesses she cried seizing him by the hand see justice done good people i impeach you pedlar where s the ring my mother s ring which you stole on midsummer s day in the castle good people his face and speaking in a mild fawning voice i hope you ll protect me i hope you wo nt see me insulted my ring my ring cried hulda he wore it on his finger but now show your hand like a man said the people if the lady says falsely ca nt you face her and tell her so never hold it down so cowardly the pedlar had tucked his feet under him and when the people cried out to him to let the rings on his hand be seen he had already burrowed with them up to his knees in the earth illustration the pedlar had now sunk up to his waist oh he will go down into the earth cried hulda but i will not let go pedlar pedlar it is useless if i follow you before the lizard your mistress i will not let eyes upon hulda and sank lower and lower the people were too frightened to move stop child cried her mother oh he will go down
highness said i ll ring the bell and stay till morning in it he took hobson s choice for no hotel there was in the vicinity his ringing was so vehement that any but in spite of all the din there was no answer audible and so with courage laudable his royal highness turned the knob and stoutly entered in then he strode across the court but he suddenly stopped short when he passed within the castle

john graham s temper seemed to change suddenly and completely from the best humoured and most careless fellow in the world he became silent thoughtful irritable toward everyone except dorothy with keene he was curt and impatient avoiding him as much as possible and when deep dislike and rising anger they had had sharp words when they were alone i was sure but keene s coolness seemed to grow with graham s heat there was no open quarrel one saturday evening graham came to me you have seen what is going on here he said something at least i answered and i am very sorry for it but i do nt quite understand it well i do and i m going to put an end to it i m going to have it out with ned keene he is breaking her heart but are you the right one to take the matter up who else is there to do it her father he sees nothing comprehends nothing practical type poetic type misunderstandings sure to arise come together after a while each supply the other s deficiencies cursed folly and the it shall not go on i say keene is out on the road now taking one of his infernal walks i m going to meet him i m afraid it will make trouble let me go with you the trouble is made come if you like i m going now the night lay heavy upon the forest where the road dipped through the valley we could hardly see a rod ahead of us but higher up where the way curved around the breast of the mountain the woods were thin on the left and on the right a sheer precipice fell away to the gorge of the brook in the dim starlight we saw keene striding toward us graham stepped out to meet him where have you been ned keene he cried the cry was a challenge keene lifted his head and stood still then he laughed and took a step forward taking a long walk jack graham should have been with me but why this sudden question because your long walk is a pretence you are playing false there is some woman that you go to see at west point at highland falls who knows where keene laughed again certainly you do nt know my dear fellow and neither do i since when has walking become a vice in your estimation you seem to be in a fierce mood what s the matter i will tell you what s the matter you have been acting like a brute to the girl you profess to love plain words but between friends frankness is best did she ask you to tell me no you know too well she would die before she would speak you are killing her that is what you are doing with your devilish moods and mysteries you must stop do you hear you must give her up i hear her and two for yourself is that it damn you cried the younger man let the words go we ll settle it this way and he sprang at the other s throat keene cool and well braced met him with a heavy blow in the chest he recoiled and i rushed between them holding graham back and pleading for self control as we stood thus panting and confused on the edge of the cliff a singing voice floated up to us from the shadows across the valley it was herrick s song again a heart as soft a heart as kind a heart as sound and free is in the whole world thou canst find that heart i ll give to thee come gentlemen i cried this is folly sheer madness you can never deal with the matter in this way think of the girl who is singing down yonder what would happen to from her own feelings if either of you should be killed or even seriously hurt by the other there must be no quarrel between you certainly said keene whose poise if shaken at all had returned certainly you are right it is not of my seeking nor shall i be the one to keep it up i am willing to let it pass it is but a small matter at most i turned to graham and you he hesitated a little and then said doggedly on one condition and that is keene must explain he must answer my question do you accept i asked keene yes and no he replied no to answering graham s question he is not the person to ask it i wonder that he does not see the impropriety the absurdity of his meddling at all in this even if he believed it but to the explanation i say yes i will give it not to graham but to you i make you this proposition to morrow is sunday we shall be excused from service if we tell the master that we have important business to settle together you shall come with me on one of my long walks i will tell you all about them then you can be the judge whether there is any harm in them does that satisfy you i said to graham yes he answered that seems fair enough i am content to leave it in that way for the present and to make it still more fair i want to take back what i said awhile ago and to ask keene s pardon for it not at all said keene quickly it was said in haste i bear no grudge you simply did not understand that the hill and as we turned dorothy met us coming out of the shadows what are you men doing here she asked i heard your voices from below what were you talking about we were talking said keene my dear dorothy we were talking about walking yes that
which you believe a distant and indifferent god has denied you to you i declare that in this encircling ever present invisible exhaustless beneficence is already provided a lavish abundance of everything which you can possibly want or think nay desire itself is but god good love knocking at the door of your consciousness it is impossible for you to desire anything that is not already your own it only remains for you to bring the invisible into visibility to take of the everlasting substance what you will and how must you do this ask and believe that you have you have asked many times perhaps and have failed to receive why you have failed to believe ask then for what you will ask and at once asking and believing is the thing itself made manifest declare that it is yours expect it believe it hold to it without wavering no matter how empty your hands may seem it is yours and god s infinite creation shall lapse into nothingness his stars shall fall from high heaven like withered leaves sooner than that you shall fail to obtain all that you have asked when at the close of the lecture mrs b isabelle smart became the center of a polite yet insistent crush of satins velvets and broadcloths permeated by an aroma of violets and a gentle hum of delicate flattery she was aware of a timid hand upon her arm and turned to look into the small eager face under the unfashionable bonnet you you meant religious gifts did you not faltered the faint discouraged voice faith hope and and the the being resigned to god s will and and endeavoring to bear the cross i meant everything that you want answered the bright eyed one with deliberate emphasis the bright eyes softening as they took in more completely the pinched outlines and the eager child s look shining from out the worn and faded woman s face but but there is so much i i never had anything that i really wanted things you know that one could hardly mention in one s prayers have them now have them all god is all all is god you are god s god is yours then the billowing surges of silk and velvet swept the small inquiring face into the background with the accustomed ease and relentlessness of billowing surges having partaken copiously of certain material beliefs consisting of salads and sandwiches accompanied by divers cups of strong coffee mrs j mortimer van deuser had become pleasantly flushed and expansive a most unique comprehensive and uplifting view of our spiritual environment she remarked to miss philura her best society smile still lingered blandly about the curves and creases of her stolid high colored visage the dying violets on her massive satin bosom gave forth their sweetest parting breath the little lady on the front seat of the carriage sat very erect red spots glowed upon her faded cheeks i think she said tremulously that it was just wonderful i i am so very happy to have heard it thank you a thousand times dear cousin maria for taking me mrs van deuser raised her gold rimmed glasses and settled them under arching brows while the society smile faded quite away of course she said coldly one should make due and proper allowance for facts as they exist and also er consider above all what interpretation is best suited to one s individual station in life truth my dear philura adapts itself freely to the needs of the poor and lowly as well as to the demands and position our dear master himself spoke of the poor as always with us you will remember a lowly but pious life passed in humble recognition of god s chastening providence is doubtless good and proper for many worthy persons miss philura s blue eyes flashed rebelliously for perhaps the first time in uncounted years she made no answer as for the long and presumably instructive homily on the duties and prerogatives of the lowly lasting quite up to the moment when the carriage stopped before the door of mrs van deuser s residence it fell upon ears which heard not indeed her next remark was so entirely irrelevant that her august kinswoman stared in displeased amazement i am going to purchase some some necessaries to morrow cousin maria i should like fifine to go with me miss philura acknowledged to herself with a truthfulness which she felt to be almost brazen that her uppermost yearnings were of a wholly mundane character during a desires by bedtime she had even ventured with the aid of a stubbed lead pencil to indite the most immediate and urgent of these wants as they knocked at the door of her consciousness the list hidden guiltily away in the depths of her shabby purse read something as follows i wish to be beautiful and admired i want two new dresses a hat with plumes and a silk petticoat that rustles i want some new kid gloves and a feather boa a long one made of ostrich feathers i wish the small blunt pencil had been lifted in air for the space of three minutes before it again descended then with cheeks that burned miss philura had written the fateful words i wish to have a lover and to be married there i have done it she said to herself her little fingers trembling with agitation he must already exist in the encircling good he is mine moment to lay this singular memorandum before her maker appeared to miss philura little short of sacrilegious but the thought of the mysterious abundance of which the seeress had spoken urging itself as it were upon her acceptance encouraged her she arose from her evening orisons with a glowing face i have asked she said aloud and i believe i shall have mademoiselle fifine passed a very enjoyable morning with miss philura
nt know the usual thing that she d only wanted to prove she was his wife on the child s account that she d never wanted his money hinton said she was very quiet not in the least excited but she sent back the cheque kate sat motionless her head bent her hands clasped about her knees she no longer looked at peyton could there have been a mistake she asked slowly a mistake she raised her head now and fixed her eyes on his with a strange insistence of observation courts did nt think so could the courts have been mistaken he started up again and threw himself into another chair good god kate we gave her every chance to prove her case why did nt she do it you do nt know what you re talking about such things are kept from girls why whenever a man of arthur s kind dies such such women turn up there are lawyers who live on such jobs ask your father about it of course this woman expected to be bought off but if she would nt take your money she expected a big sum i mean to drop the case when she found we meant to fight it she saw the game was up i suppose it was her last throw and she was desperate we do nt know how many times she may have been through the same thing before that kind of woman is always man who who has been about with them kate received this in silence she had a sense of walking along a narrow ledge of consciousness above a sheer hallucinating depth into which she dared not look but the depth drew her and she plunged one terrified glance into it but the child the child was arthur s peyton shrugged his shoulders there again how can we tell why i do nt suppose the woman herself i wish to heaven your father were here to explain she rose and crossed over to him laying her hands on his shoulders with a gesture almost maternal do nt let us talk of it she said you did all you could think what a comfort you were to poor arthur he let her hands lie where she had placed them without response or resistance i tried i tried hard to keep him straight we all know that every was what a difference it made to him in the end it would have been dreadful to think of his dying out there alone she drew him down on a sofa and seated herself by his side a deep lassitude was upon him and the hand she had possessed herself of lay in her hold inert it was splendid of you to travel day and night as you did and then that dreadful week before he died but for you he would have died alone among strangers he sat silent his head dropping forward his eyes fixed among strangers he repeated absently she looked up as if struck by a sudden thought that poor woman did you ever see her while you were out there he drew his hand away and gathered his brows together as if in an effort of remembrance i saw her oh yes i saw her he pushed the tumbled hair from his forehead and he said my head is in a fog i want to get away from it all a wave of compunction drew her to her feet it was my fault i ought not to have asked so many questions she turned and rang the bell i ll order the ponies we shall have time for a drive before sunset ii with the sunset in their faces they swept through the keen scented autumn air at the swiftest pace of kate s ponies she had given the reins to peyton and he had turned the horses heads away from the lake rising by woody upland lanes to the high pastures which still held the sunlight the horses were fresh enough to claim his undivided attention and he drove in silence his smooth fair profile turned to his companion who sat silent also kate orme was engaged in one of those rapid mental excursions which were forever sweeping her from the straight path of the actual into uncharted regions of conjecture the tendency to seek out ultimate relations to extend her researches to the limit of her imaginative experience but hitherto she had been like some young captive brought up in a windowless palace whose painted walls she takes for the actual world now the palace had been shaken to its base and through a cleft in the walls she looked out upon life for the first moment all was indistinguishable blackness then she began to detect vague shapes and confused gestures in the depths there were people below there men like denis girls like herself for under the unlikeness she felt the strange affinity all struggling in that awful coil of moral darkness with agonized hands reaching up for rescue her heart shrank from the horror of it and then in a passion of pity drew back to the edge of the abyss suddenly her eyes turned toward denis his face was grave but less disturbed and men knew about these things they carried this abyss in their bosoms of innocence could it be that denis denis even ah no she remembered what he had been to poor arthur she understood now the vague allusions to what he had tried to do for his brother he had seen arthur down there in that coiling blackness and had leaned over and tried to drag him out but arthur was too deep down and his arms were interlocked with other arms they had dragged each other deeper poor souls like drowning people who fight together in the waves kate s visualizing habit gave a hateful precision and persistency to the image she had evoked

to save time you are to go right to the person who ordered it without stopping to change your clothes you can do that there it will make her late to the ball at best a carriage and a person to magnificent dress that was gradually built upon the figure of clarissa and when at last it was completed and she stood before the great pier glass flushed with the radiance of a pleasure she could not but feel despite her late sorrow and the fact she was but the lay figure for a more fortunate woman one would have to search far to find a more beautiful creature whyee exclaimed mrs mcguffin why i had no idea you had such a figure why i must have you in my department to show off dresses on you will work at the cutlery counter not a day after to morrow but there i am keeping you the ball must almost have begun here s a bag with your things in it i was going to say your other things and throwing a splendid cloak about the lovely shoulders of miss clarissa mrs mcguffin turned her over to the messenger there was already somebody in the carriage into which clarissa stepped window she was unable to even conjecture the sex of the individual who was to be her conductor to her destination and steeped in dreams which from pleasant ones quickly passed to bitter she speedily forgot all about the person at her side but presently she perceived their carriage had come into the midst of a squadron of other carriages charging down upon a brilliantly lighted entrance where men and women brave in evening dress were moving in why we are going to the ball room itself and as she said this and realized that here on the very threshold of the entrancing gayeties she was to put off her fine plumage and see the other woman pass out of the dressing room into the delights beyond while she crept away in her own simple garb amid the questioning amused and contemptuous stares of the haughty dames who had witnessed the exchange she broke into a piteous sob why of course to the ball room my darling breathed a voice which low of an archangel and she felt herself strained to a man s heart and her bare shoulders which peeped from the cloak at the thrust of a pair of strong arms beneath it came in contact with the cool smooth surface of the bosom of a dress shirt do nt you remember that i engaged the second two step at the charity ball clarissa almost swooning with joy as she reclined palpitating upon the manly breast of captain william leadbury said never a word for the power of speech was not in her the power of song of uttering peans of joy perhaps but not the power of speech have i assumed too much said leadbury gravely relaxing somewhat the tightness of his embrace have i arguing from the fact that you both served me in the crisis of my career and saved my life assumed too much in believing you love me if so i beg your pardon for arranging this surprise i no crooned clarissa nestling against him with all the quivering protest of a child about to be taken from its mother you read my actions rightly oh how i have suffered this week no word from you i could not understand it of course you could not know i was a girl but i thought you ought to be grateful even to a boy but i did know you were a girl when you fell i began to open the clothes about your chest when i discovered your sex i carried you upstairs placed you on a bed threw a blanket over you and was about to call miss bording to take charge of you i m glad you did nt i do nt like miss bording said clarissa i had left to call her when that poltroon of an anderson walkley who had stolen back into the house after running from it crept behind me and i dropped unconscious in the resulting confusion your very existence was as forgotten as your whereabouts was unknown you lay there as i had left you until a maid found you in the morning and packed you off it was not until wednesday that i was able to be out i knew you came from this store and mousing about in there i had no trouble in identifying the nice young page with the beautiful young woman at the cutlery counter i could scarce wait two days but as three had already passed i planned this surprise remembering our banter when i talked with you disguised as a man of fifty and now you are to go in with me as my affianced bride we d better hurry for the driver must be wondering what we are thinking about it was worthy of remark that even the ladies passed many compliments upon the beauty and grace of miss clarissa dawson the young woman who came to the ball with william leadbury heir to the millions of the late james leadbury and a number of persons esteemed judges of all that pertains to the terpsichorean art declared that when she appeared upon the floor for the first time which was to dance the second two step with the gallant soldier that such was the surpassing grace with which she revolved over the floor that one might well say she seemed to be dancing upon air what befell mr middleton because of the sixth gift of the emir it is strange said mr middleton that after clarissa had shown her devotion to the extent of saving his life captain leadbury could have had even for a moment any misgivings that she loved him one can not always be sure said
were limping and staggering mercedes was riding the loaded sled hal guided at the gee pole and charles stumbled along in the rear as buck watched them thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones by the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the gee pole with hal clinging to it jerk into the air mercedes s scream came to their ears they saw charles turn and make one step to run back and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear a yawning hole was all that was to be seen the bottom had dropped out of the trail john thornton and said john thornton and buck licked his hand chapter vi for the love of a man when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw logs for dawson he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him and here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature buck slowly won back his strength a rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones for that matter they were all loafing buck john thornton and skeet and nig waiting for the raft to come was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed buck s wounds regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her self appointed task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for thornton s nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog half bloodhound and half deerhound with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature to buck s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence love genuine passionate love was his at judge miller s down in the sun kissed santa clara valley with the judge s sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the judge s grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship but love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken john thornton to arouse this man had saved his life which was something but further he was the ideal master other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it and he saw further he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with them gas he called it was as much his delight as theirs he had a way of taking buck s head roughly between s of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god you can all but speak buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt he would often seize thornton s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress for the most part however buck s love was expressed in adoration or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under thornton s hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on thornton s knee buck was content to adore at a distance he would lie by the hour eager alert at thornton s feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of buck s gaze would draw john thornton s head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as buck s heart shone out for a long time get out of his sight from the moment he left the tent
little garden was bright and full of leaves and flowers it s life she said to judith judith nodded and smiled back at her understanding quite well just as she had understood the eyes of the bird who had swung on the twig so near her cheek the day she had hidden among the bushes in the park now you must go the little girl said at last and judith went out of the room at once without waiting or looking back though she knew the white figure did not stir till she was out of sight it was not until she had reached the second floor that the change came upon her it was a great change and a curious one the closed room became as far away as all other places and things had seemed when she had stood upon the roof feeling the nearness of the blueness and the white clouds as when she had looked round and found herself face to face with the child in the closed room she knew that she had heard no voice when the little girl spoke to her she knew that it had happened that it was she only who had lifted the doll who had taken out the toys who had arranged the low table for their feast putting all the small service upon it and though they had played with such rapturous enjoyment and had laughed and feasted what had they feasted on that she could not recall and not once had she touched or been touched by the light hand or white dress and though they seemed to express their thoughts and intentions freely she had heard no voice at all she was suddenly bewildered and stood rubbing her hand over her forehead and her eyes but she was happy as happy as when she had fallen awake in her sleep and was no more troubled or really curious than she would have been if she had had the same experience every day of her life well you must have been having a good time playing up stairs jane foster said when she entered the big kitchen this is going to do a day in the country do nt she jem through the weeks that followed her habit of playing up stairs was accepted as a perfectly natural thing no questions were asked and she knew it was not necessary to enter into any explanations every day she went to the door of the closed room and finding it closed at a touch of her hand upon the panel it swung softly open there she waited sometimes for a longer sometimes for a shorter time and the child with the coppery hair came to her the world below was gone as soon as she entered the room and through the hours they played together joyously as happy children play but in their playing it was always judith who touched the toys who held the doll who set the little table for their feast once as she went down stairs she remembered that when she had that day made a wreath of roses from the roof and had gone to put it on her playmate s head she had drawn back with deepened dimple laughing no do not touch me but there was no mystery in it after all judith knew she should presently understand she was so happy that her happiness lived in her face in a sort of delicate brilliance jane foster observed the change in her with exceeding comfort her view being that spacious quarters fresh air and sounder sleep had done great things for her them big eyes of hers ai nt like no other child s eyes i ve ever seen she said to her husband with cheerful self gratulation an her skin s that fine an thin an fair you can jest see through it she always looks to me as if she was made out of different stuff from me an you jem i ve always said it she s going to make a corking handsome girl responded jem with a chuckle they had been in the house two months when one afternoon as she was slicing child standing at the kitchen doorway looking with a puzzled expression at some wilted flowers she held in her hand jane s impression was that she had been coming into the room and had stopped suddenly to look at what she held what ve you got there judy she asked they re flowers said judith her eyes still more puzzled where d you get em from i did nt know you d been out i thought you was up stairs i was said judith quite simply in the closed room jane foster s knife dropped into her pan with a splash well she gasped judith looked at her with quiet eyes the closed room jane cried out what are you saying you could nt get in yes i can jane was conscious of experiencing a shock she said afterwards that suddenly something gave her the creeps persisted i tried it again yesterday as i passed by turned the handle and gave it a regular shove and it would nt give an inch yes the child answered i heard you we were inside then a few days later when jane weepingly related the incident to awe stricken and sympathizing friends she described as graphically as her limited vocabulary would allow her to do so the look in judith s face as she came nearer to her do nt tell me there was nothing happening then she said she just came up to me with them dead flowers in her hand an a kind of look in her eyes as if she was half sorry for me an did nt know quite why the door opens for me she says that s where i play every day there s a little girl comes and plays with
cause of their happiness appeared indeed the gray old miner was at dennihan s already keno had met him on the hill with an eager cry that welcome softened by the news and appeal miss doc herself came running to the gate her hungry arms outstretched to take the child just make him well was jim s one cry i know a woman can make him well and all afternoon the men at the blacksmith s shop kept up their hope keno had come to them telling of the altered plans by which little skeezucks had found his way to miss doc but by special instruction he added that jim was certain that improvement was coming already he told me that evenin is the customary hour fer to have a tree anyhow concluded keno hopefully he says he was off when he said to turn it loose at noon does he think miss doc can git the little feller fixed all up to celebrate to night inquired bone is that the bill of fare that s about it said keno importantly i m to come impatient for the night to arrive excited anew when at last it closed in on the world of snow and mountains the celebrators once more gathered at the shop and lighted up their tree the wind was rushing brusquely up the street the snow began once more to fall from the palace saloon came the sounds of music laughter song and revelry light streamed forth from the window in glowing invitation all day long its flow of steaming drinks and its endless succession of savory dishes had laded the air with temptation not a few of the citizens of borealis had succumbed to the gayer attractions of parky s festival but the men who had builded a christmas tree and loaded its branches with presents waited and waited for tiny skeezucks in the dingy shop the evening passed night aged in the way that wintry storm and lowering skies compel dismally creaked the door on its rusted hinges into the chink shot the particles of snow and formed again that icy mark the candles burned away on the tree gave a gasp a flare and expired silently loyally the group of big rough miners and toilers sat in the cheerless gloom hearing that music in its soullessness come on the gusts of the storm waiting waiting for their tiny guest at length a single candle alone illumined their pitiful tree standing with its meagre branches of greenery stiffly upheld on its scrawny frame while the darkness closed sombrely in upon the glint of the toys they had labored to make then finally keno came downcast pale and worried the little feller s awful sick he said i guess he ca nt come to the tree his statement was greeted in silence then maybe he ll see it to morrow said the blacksmith after a moment it would nt make so very much odds to us old cusses christmas is for kids of course so we ll leave her standing their final hopes slowly they all went out in the storm and night shutting the door on the christmas celebration now abandoned to darkness the creak of the hinges the long line of snow inside that pointed to the tree one by one they bade good night to webber the smith and so went home to many a cold little cabin seemingly hunched like a freezing thing in the driving storm chapter xiv if only i had the resolution for the next three or four days the tiny bit of a man at miss doc s seemed neither to be worse nor better of his ailment the hand of lethargy lay with dulling weight upon him old jim and miss dennihan were baffled though their tenderness increased and their old animosity disappeared forgotten in the stress of care that the sister of doc could develop such a spirit of motherhood astounded nearly every man in the camp accustomed to acerbities of criticism for their many shortcomings from her ever pointed tongue they marvelled the more population of the town she had scorned and verbally castigated most frequently resupplying their tree with candles the patient fellows had kept alive their hope of a great day of joy and celebration only to see it steadily receding from their view at length they decided to carry their presents to the house where the wan little foundling lay trusting the sight of their labors of love might cheer him to recovery to the utter amazement of her brother miss doc not only permitted the big rough men to track the snow through her house when they came with their gifts but she gave them kindly welcome in her face that day they readily saw some faint illusive sign of beauty heretofore unnoticed or perhaps concealed he ll come along all right she told them with a smile they found to be singularly sweet for jim do seem a comfort to the poor little thing old jim would surely have been glad to believe that he or anything supplied quietly in bed the miner sat by him all day long and far into every night only climbing to his cabin on the hill when necessity drove him away then he was back there in the morning by daylight eager but cheerful always the presents were heaped on the floor in sight of the pale little skeezucks who clung unfailingly through it all to the funny makeshift of a doll that bruvver jim had placed in his keeping he appeared not at all to comprehend the meaning of the gifts the men had brought or to know their purpose that never a genuinely happy christmas had brightened his little mysterious life miss dennihan knew by a swift keen process of womanly intuition i wisht he was nt so sad she said from time to time i expect he s maybe pinin

she seemed no longer conscious he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes it sank away slowly vanishing the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water before long they were dry in the sun it was fearful to and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world and how hot the sun would be without any lake she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone but she never cried proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake s decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion hum drum and kopy keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain not even they could suggest a cause now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else had out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight soon set all right the king and the people shall die of thirst their brains shall boil and frizzle in their skulls before i will lose my revenge and she laughed a ferocious laugh that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror then she went to an old chest in the room and opening it took out what looked like a piece of dried seaweed this she threw into a tub of water then she threw some powder into the water and stirred it with her bare arm muttering over it words of hideous sound and yet more hideous import then she set the tub aside and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys that clattered in her shaking hands then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all before she had finished out from the tub the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it came the head but the witch did not look round it grew out of the tub waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion till it reached the princess when it laid its head upon her shoulder and gave a low hiss in her ear she started but with joy and seeing the head resting on her shoulder drew it towards her and kissed it then she drew it all out of the tub and wound it round her body it was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld the white snakes of darkness then she took the keys and went down to her cellar and as she unlocked the door she said to herself this is worth living for locking the door behind her she descended a few steps into the cellar and crossing it unlocked another door into a dark narrow passage she locked this also behind her and descended a few more steps if any one had followed the witch princess he would have a few steps after unlocking each when she had unlocked the last she entered a vast cave the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock now this roof was the under side of the bottom of the lake she then untwined the snake from her body and held it by the tail high above her the hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern which it was just able to reach it then began to move its head backwards and forwards with a slow oscillating motion as if looking for something at the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern coming nearer to the centre every circuit while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor for she kept holding it up and still it kept slowly osculating round and round the cavern they went ever lessening the circuit till at last the snake made a sudden dart that s right my beauty cried the princess drain it dry she let it go left it hanging and sat down on a great stone with her black cat which had followed her all round the cave by her side then she began to knit and mutter awful words the snake hung like a huge leech sucking at the stone the cat stood with his back arched and his tail like a piece of cable looking up at the snake and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered seven days and seven nights they remained thus when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed the witch started to her feet picked it up put it in her pocket and looked up at the roof one drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking as
my name is lew flapp i m looking for a fellow was the name dan baxter had assumed for the time being it s all right old woman tell him to come in said a voice from inside the cottage and lew flapp entered the house immediately the old woman closed the door after him and barred it chapter xii flapp and baxter plot mischief the cottage which mother matterson occupied was a much dilapidated one of a story and a half containing three rooms and a loft some of the windows were broken out and the chimney was sadly in need of repair many were the rumors afloat concerning this old woman some said she was little short of being a witch while others had it that she was in league with tramps who had stolen things for miles around but so far if guilty she had escaped the penalty of the law so you ve come at last went on the person in the cottage as lew flapp came in and a moment later dan baxter came old with a sour look on his face and several scars which made him particularly repulsive i had almost given you up i ve had my own troubles getting here answered flapp at first i could nt locate hacknack and then i had the misfortune to fall in with sam rover sam rover is he on your track now i rather guess not and the bully of putnam hall gave a short laugh he has gone swimming for his health what do you mean i ll tell you answered lew flapp and in a rapid manner he related all that had occurred since he had met sam in the oak run barber shop well all i can say is that you are a lucky dog came from dan baxter at the conclusion of the recital you can thank your stars that you are not at this moment in the oak run lock up all if it had nt been for you growled flapp oh do nt come any such game on me flapp i can read you like a book you know you do nt dare to go home after that trip up at white corners your old man would just about kill you and you d be locked up in the bargain at these words lew flapp winced for he knew that dan baxter spoke the truth he was afraid to go home and had come to hacknack simply because he knew not where else to go and because baxter had promised him some money the amount he had realized on the sale of the stolen jewelry had been spent see here what s the use of talking that way he grumbled i did nt come here to get a lecture i m not lecturing you came hastily from dan baxter i m merely telling you things for your own good flapp i want you along swimmingly you said you d let me have some money and i ll keep my word i need at least fifty dollars you ll need more than that flapp you ve got to stay away from home until this matter blows over or until your old man patches things up with that aaron fairchild and the white corners authorities i ve got a plan if you care to listen to it sure i ll listen if you ll only let me have that money i ll let you have all you want providing you ll agree to help me well what is your plan but first tell me how about this woman and flapp nodded his head toward mother matterson do nt you worry about her grinned dan baxter i ve got her fixed she wo nt squeal then go ahead as i said before the home until this unpleasantness blows over write to your father and tell him it is all a mistake and that you are not guilty but that you ca nt prove it ask him to square the thing with aaron fairchild and the others and tell him you are going on an ocean trip and wo nt be back until you know you are safe then you come with me and we ll have a jolly good time besides squaring up matters with the rovers where are you going and how are you going to square matters with them i ve learned a thing or two since i came here at first i was going to try to fix them while they were at home but now i ve learned that they are going away on a houseboat trip on the ohio and the mississippi i propose to follow them and give them more than they want the first opportunity that presents itself you are certain about this houseboat trip i the three rover boys and some of their school chums humph i d like to get square with the whole crowd muttered lew flapp i d like to sink them in the middle of the ohio river we ll square up do nt you worry answered dan baxter i m not forgetting all they ve done against me in the past if i had the chance i d wring the neck of every one of them he added fiercely i do nt think it is safe to stay around here any longer said lew flapp after a pause somebody may spot us both i m not going to stay any longer we can get out on the night train by the way supposing sam rover does nt get out of the river what do you mean questioned flapp with a shiver although he knew well enough maybe sam say that bah do nt be chicken hearted flapp i i did nt mean to to kill him i know you did nt just the same that is a dangerous river the current is swift and it s full of
face regarded him with natural indifference and looked out of the window forgetting him a few moments later accidentally aware of him again she carelessly noted his superficially attractive qualities and approving resumed her idle inspection of the passing round she found him looking rather fixedly at her and involuntarily she returned the gaze with a childlike directness a gaze which he sustained to the limit of good breeding then evaded so amiably that it left an impression rather agreeable than otherwise i do nt see thought aphrodite why i never meet that sort of man he has nt art nouveau legs and his features are not by products of his hair i have told my brothers in law that i am old enough to go out without coming out and i am the lovely mouth grew sullen again i do nt wish to wait two years and be what dreadful newspapers call a bud i wish to go to dinners and dances now where i ll meet that sort of man the sort one feels almost at liberty to talk to without anybody presenting anybody i ve a mind to look amiable the next time he he raised his eyes at that instant but that is the effect of civilization on me she reflected metropolitan civilization i felt like saying for goodness sake let s say something even in spite of all my sisters have told me i ca nt see why it would be dangerous for me to look amiable if he glances at me again so agreeably he did but she did nt smile you see she said accusing herself discontentedly you do nt dare look human why because you ve had it so drummed into you that you can never never again do anything natural why oh because they all begin to talk about mysterious dangers when you say you wish to be natural i ve made up my mind to look interested the next time he turns why should nt he see that i m quite willing to talk to him and i m so tired of looking out of the window before i came to anybody who attracted me and i m not now so if he does look at me he did the faintest glimmer of a smile troubled her lips she thought i do wish he d speak there was a very becoming color in his face partly because he was experienced enough not to mistake her partly from a sudden and complete realization of her beauty it s so odd thought aphrodite that attractive people consider it dangerous to speak to one another i do nt see any danger i wonder what he has in that square box beside him it ca nt be a camera it ca nt be a folding easel it simply ca nt be that he is an artist a man like that are you she asked quite involuntarily what he replied astonished wheeling around an an artist i ca nt believe it and i do you know for a moment he could scarcely realize that she had spoken his keen gaze dissected the face before him the unembarrassed eyes the oval contour the smooth flawless loveliness of a child yes i am an artist he said considering her curiously i am sorry she said no not sorry only unpleasantly surprised you see i am so tired of art and i thought you looked so so wholesome he began to laugh a modulated laugh rather infectious too for aphrodite bit her lip then smiled not exactly understanding it all why do you laugh she asked still smiling have i said something i should not have said but he replied with a question have you found art unwholesome i i do nt know she answered with a little sigh i am so tired of it all you it is nt often i talk about it he said laughing again oh that is unusual why do nt you talk about art i m much too busy d doing what if that is not very impertinent oh making pictures of things he said intensely amused pictures you do nt talk about art and you paint pictures yes w what kind do you mind my asking you are so so very unusual well to earn my living i make full page pictures for magazines to satisfy an absurd desire i paint people things anything that might satisfy my color senses he shrugged his shoulders gaily you see i m the sort you are so tired of but you paint the artists i know do nt paint except that way she the air and before she had achieved it they were both convulsed with laughter you never do that do you she asked at length no i never do i ca nt afford to decorate the atmosphere for nothing then then you are not interested in art nouveau no and i never could see that beautiful music resembled frozen architecture they were laughing again looking with confidence what is a necklace of precious tones she asked precious stones no tones let me cite as an example those beautiful verses of henry haynes he replied gravely to be or not to be i d rather be a could be if i can not be an are for a could be is a may be with a chance of touching par i had rather be a has been than a might have been by far for a was once an are also an are is is and am a was was all of these so i d rather be a has been than a has nt if you please and they fell a laughing so shamelessly that the bus driver turned and squinted through his shutter at them and the scandalized horses stopped of their own accord are you going to leave he asked as she rose yes this is the park she said
greatly puzzled me during the first days of my residence in the rested upon all at first it appeared to be connected wholly with direction the horde feared the northeast it lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass and every individual gazed more frequently and with greater alarm in that direction than in any other when lop ear and i went toward the north east to eat the stringy rooted carrots that at that season were at their best he became unusually timid he was content to eat the leavings the big tough carrots and the little ropy ones rather than to venture a short distance farther on to where the carrots were as yet untouched when i so ventured he scolded me and quarrelled with me he gave me to understand that in that direction was some horrible danger but just what the horrible danger was his paucity of language would not permit him to say many a good meal i got in this fashion while he scolded and chattered vainly at me i could not understand i kept very alert but i could myself and the nearest tree and knew that to that haven of refuge i could out foot the tawny one or old saber tooth did one or the other suddenly appear one late afternoon in the village a great uproar arose the horde was animated with a single emotion that of fear the bluff side swarmed with the folk all gazing and pointing into the northeast i did not know what it was but i scrambled all the way up to the safety of my own high little cave before ever i turned around to see and then across the river away into the northeast i saw for the first time the mystery of smoke it was the biggest animal i had ever seen i thought it was a monster snake up ended rearing its head high above the trees and swaying back and forth and yet somehow i seemed to gather from the conduct of the folk that the smoke itself was not the danger they appeared to fear it else was i was unable to guess nor could they tell me yet i was soon to know and i was to know it as a thing more terrible than the tawny one than old saber tooth than the snakes themselves than which it seemed there could be no things more terrible chapter vii broken tooth was another youngster who lived by himself his mother lived in the caves but two more children had come after him and he had been thrust out to shift for himself we had witnessed the performance during the several preceding days and it had given us no little glee broken tooth did not want to go and every time his mother left the cave he sneaked back into it when she returned and found him there her rages were delightful half the horde made a practice of watching for these moments first from within the cave would come her scolding and shrieking then we could hear sounds of the thrashing and the yelling of broken tooth about this time like the eruption of a miniature volcano broken tooth would come flying out at the end of several days his leaving home was accomplished he wailed his grief unheeded from the centre of the open space for at least half an hour and then came to live with lop ear and me our cave was small but with squeezing there was room for three i have no recollection of broken tooth spending more than one night with us so the accident must have happened right away it came in the middle of the day in the morning we had eaten our fill of the carrots and then made heedless by play we had ventured on to the big trees just beyond i can not understand how lop ear got over his habitual caution but it must have been the play we were having a great time playing tree tag and such tag we leaped ten or fifteen foot gaps as a matter of course and a twenty or twenty five foot deliberate drop clear down i am almost afraid to say the great distances we dropped as we grew older and heavier we found we had to be more cautious in dropping but at that age our bodies were all strings and springs and we could do anything broken tooth displayed remarkable agility in the game he was it less frequently than any of us and in the course of the game he discovered one difficult slip that neither lop ear nor i was able to accomplish to be truthful we were afraid to attempt it when we were it broken tooth always ran out to the end of a lofty branch in a certain tree from the end of the branch to the ground it must have been seventy feet and nothing intervened to break a fall but about twenty feet lower down and fully fifteen feet out from the perpendicular was the thick branch of another tree as we ran out the limb broken tooth facing us would begin teetering this naturally teetering than that he teetered with his back to the jump he was to make just as we nearly reached him he would let go the teetering branch was like a spring board it threw him far out backward as he fell and as he fell he turned around sidewise in the air so as to face the other branch into which he was falling this branch bent far down under the impact and sometimes there was an ominous crackling but it never broke and out of the leaves was always to be seen the face of broken tooth grinning triumphantly up at us i was it the last time broken tooth tried this he had gained the end of the branch
cumberland and it is now your right to claim and receive from the hands of the queen of love and beauty the chaplet of honor which your skill has justly deserved advance sir knight of the cumberland and dismount the knight of the cumberland made no move nor sound get off yo hoss son said the hon sam kindly and get down on yo knees at the feet of them steps this fair young queen is a goin to put this chaplet on your shinin brow that horse ll stand the knight of the cumberland after a moment s hesitation steps with a slouching gait and looking about him right and left the blight blushing prettily took the chaplet and went down the steps to meet him unmask i shouted yes son said the hon sam take that rag off then mollie s voice clear and loud startled the crowd you better not dave branham fer if you do and this other gal puts that thing on you you ll never what penalty she was going to inflict i do nt know for the knight of the cumberland half kneeling sprang suddenly to his feet and interrupted her wait a minute will ye he said almost fiercely and at the sound of his voice mollie rose to her feet and her face blanched lord god she said almost in anguish and then she dropped quickly to her seat again the knight of the cumberland had gone back to his horse as he vaulted into the saddle and as the black horse sprang toward the opening tore his mask from his face turned in his stirrups and brandished his spear with a yell of defiance while a dozen voices shouted the wild dog then was there an uproar goddle mighty shouted the hon sam i did nt do it i swear i did nt know it he s tricked me he s tricked me do nt shoot you might hit that hoss there was no doubt about the hon sam s innocence instead of turning over an outlaw to the police he had brought him into the inner shrine of law and order and he knew what a political asset for his enemies that insult would be and there was no doubt of the innocence of mollie and buck as they stood mollie wringing her hands and buck with open mouth and startled face there was no doubt about the innocence of anybody other than dave branham and the dare devil knight dog s bridle and missed and the outlaw struck savagely at him with his spear nobody dared to shoot because of the scattering crowd but every knight and every mounted policeman took out after the outlaw and the beating of hoofs pounded over the little mound and toward poplar hill marston ran to his horse at the upper end threw his saddle on and hesitated there were enough after the wild dog and his horse was blown he listened to the yells and sounds of the chase encircling poplar hill the outlaw was making for lee all at once the yells and hoof beats seemed to sound nearer and marston listened astonished the wild dog had wheeled and was coming back he was going to make for the gap where sure safety lay marston buckled his girth and as he sprang on his horse unconsciously taking his spear with him the wild dog dashed from the trees at the far end of the field as marston started the wild dog saw him pulled something that flashed again and brandishing his spear he came full speed and yelling up the middle of the field it was a strange thing to happen in these modern days but marston was an officer of the law and was between the wild dog and the ford and liberty through the gap into the hills the wild dog was an outlaw it was marston s duty to take him the law does not prescribe with what weapon the lawless shall be subdued and marston s spear was the only weapon he had moreover the wild dog s yell was a challenge that set his blood afire and the girl both loved was looking on the crowd gathered the meaning of the joust the knights were crashing toward each other with spears at rest there were a few surprised oaths from men a few low cries from women and then dead silence in which the sound of hoofs on the hard turf was like thunder the blight s face was white and the little sister was gripping into view out of the woods at tight angles to stop them and it seemed that the three horses must crash together in a heap with a moan the blight buried her face on my shoulder she shivered when the muffled thud of body against body and the splintering of wood rent the air a chorus of shrieks arose about her and when she lifted her frightened face marston the discarded was limp on the ground his horse was staggering to his feet and the wild dog was galloping past her his helmet gleaming his eyes ablaze his teeth set the handle of his broken spear clinched in his right hand and blood streaming down the shoulder of the black horse she heard the shots that were sent after him she heard him plunge into the river and then she saw and heard no more viii the knight passes a telegram summoned the blight a home next day marston was in bed with a ragged wound in the shoulder left the room for a few minutes and when i came back their hands were unclasping and for a discarded knight the engineer surely wore a happy though pallid face that afternoon the train on which we left the gap was brought to a sudden halt in wildcat valley by a piece of red flannel tied to the end of
forbidden things and her son without sharing her simple faith in their omniscience credited them with an ample supply of the kind of information of which he was in search mrs boykin from the corner of an intensely modern gobelin sofa studied her cousin as he balanced himself insecurely on one of the small fanny de malrive oh of course i remember you were all very intimate with the frisbees when they lived in west thirty third street but she has dropped all her american friends since her marriage the excuse was that de malrive did nt like them but as she s been separated for five or six years i ca nt see you say she s been very nice to your mother and the girls well i daresay she is beginning to feel the need of friends she can really trust for as for her french relations that malrive set is the worst in the faubourg of course you know what he is even the family for decency s sake had to back her up and urge her to get a separation and christiane de treymes durham seized his opportunity is she so very reprehensible too mrs boykin pursed up her small colourless mouth i ca nt speak from personal experience i know madame de treymes fact except when she wants me to go to one of her ventes de charite they all remember us then and some american women are silly enough to ruin themselves at the smart bazaars and fancy they will get invitations in return they say mrs addison g pack followed madame d alglade around for a whole winter and spent a hundred thousand francs at her stalls and at the end of the season madame d alglade asked her to tea and when she got there she found that was for a charity too and she had to pay a hundred francs to get in mrs boykin paused with a smile of compassion that is not my way she continued personally i have no desire to thrust myself into french society i ca nt see how any american woman can do so without loss of self respect but any one can tell you about madame de treymes i wish you would then durham suggested well i think elmer had better at this point advanced across the wide expanse of aubusson on which his wife and durham were islanded in a state of propinquity without privacy what s that bessy hah durham how are you did nt see you at auteuil this afternoon you do nt race busy sight seeing i suppose what was that my wife was telling you oh about madame de treymes he stroked his pepper and salt moustache with a gesture intended rather to indicate than conceal the smile of experience beneath it well madame de treymes has not been like a happy country she s had a history several of em some one said she constituted the feuilleton of the faubourg daily news la suite au prochain numero you see the point not that i speak from personal knowledge bessy and i have never cared to force our way he paused reflecting that his wife had probably anticipated him in the expression of this familiar sentiment and added with a significant nod no i m surprised at that well he s one of the choicest ornaments of the jockey club very fascinating to the ladies i believe but the deuce and all at baccara ruined his mother and a couple of maiden aunts already and now madame de treymes has put the family pearls up the spout and is wearing imitation for love of him i had that straight from my maid s cousin who is employed by madame d armillac s jeweller said mrs boykin with conscious pride oh it s straight enough more than she is retorted her husband who was slightly jealous of having his facts reinforced by any information not of his own gleaning be careful of what you say elmer mrs boykin interposed with archness i suspect john of being seriously smitten by the lady durham let this pass unchallenged submitting with a good grace to his host s low whistle of amusement and the sardonic enquiry they call over here a fine lame oh i do nt mean to resort to bloodshed unless it s absolutely necessary but i mean to make the lady s acquaintance said durham falling into his key mrs boykin s lips tightened to the vanishing point i am afraid you must apply for an introduction to more fashionable people than we are elmer and i so thoroughly disapprove of french society that we have always declined to take any part in it but why should not fanny de malrive arrange a meeting for you durham hesitated i do nt think she is on very intimate terms with her husband s family you mean that she s not allowed to introduce her friends to them mrs boykin interjected sarcastically while her husband added with an air of portentous initiation ah my dear fellow the way they treat the americans over here that s another chapter you know how some people can stand it footman entering at that moment tendered her a large coronetted envelope she held it up as if in illustration of the indignities to which her countrymen were subjected look at that my dear john she exclaimed another card to one of their everlasting bazaars why it s at madame d armillac s the prince s mother madame de treymes must have sent it of course the brazen way in which they combine religion and immorality fifty francs admission rien que cela to see some of the most disreputable people in europe and if you re an american you re expected to leave at least a thousand behind you their own people naturally get off cheaper she tossed over the card to her cousin there s your
it was shortly after ten o clock one morning when ezra simpkins a reporter from the boston banner entered the oriental building that on sixth avenue and began to hunt for the office of the royal society of egyptian exploration and research after wandering through a labyrinth of halls he finally found it on the second floor a few steps farther on a stairway led down to one of the side entrances for the building could be entered from any of the four bounding streets simpkins regarded knocking on doors and sending in cards as formalities which served merely to tempt people of a retiring disposition to lie so when he walked into the waiting room and found it deserted he passed through it quickly and opened the door beyond but if he had expected this manoeuver to bring him within easy distance of the person whom he was seeking he was disappointed he had simply walked into a small outer office a self sufficient youth of twelve who was stuffed into a be buttoned suit was its sole occupant hello bub said simpkins to this cerberus of the threshold mrs athelstone in he had instantly decided to use it in place of a card as being more likely to gain him admittance aw fergit it the youth answered with fine american independence i ll let youse know when your turn comes an youse can keep your ref rences till you re asked for em and he surveyed simpkins with marked disfavor the reporter made no answer and asked no questions until that moment he had not known that he had a turn but if he had he did not propose to lose it by any foolish slip so he settled down in his chair and began to turn over his assignment in his mind that simpkins had come over to new york was due to the conviction of his managing editor mr naylor that a certain feature which had been shaping up in his head would possess a peculiar interest if it could be led with a few remarks by mrs athelstone though her husband the rev alfred w r interest in egyptology had led him to accept the presidency of the american branch of the royal society she was a leader among the theosophists and now that the old head of the cult was dead it was rumored that mrs athelstone had announced the reincarnation of madame blavatsky in her own person this in itself was a good story but it was not until a second rumor reached naylor s ears that his newspaper soul was stirred to its yellowest depths for there was in boston an association known as the american society for the investigation of ancient beliefs which was a rival of the royal society in its good work of laying bare with pick and spade the buried mysteries along the nile and this rivalry which was strong between the societies and bitter between their presidents became acute in the persons of their secretaries both of whom were women madame gianclis who served the boston society boasted egyptian blood in her veins a claim which mrs athelstone who acted as with the qualification that some ancestor of her rival had contributed a dash of the senegambian as well illustration aw fergit it this remark duly reported to madame gianclis had not put her in a humor to concede madame blavatsky s soul or any part of it to mrs athelstone promptly on hearing of her pretensions so rumor had it the boston woman had announced the reincarnation of theosophy s high priestess in herself and boston believers were inclined to accept her view as it was difficult for them to understand how any soul with liberty of action could deliberately choose a new york residence now all these things had filtered through to naylor from those just without the temple gates for whatever the quarrels of the two societies and their enemies they tried to keep them to themselves they had had experience with publicity and had found that ridicule goes hand in hand with it in this iconoclastic age but out of these rumors unconfirmed though vision of a glorified spread in the sunday banner s magazine section under a two page head builded cunningly of six sizes of type he saw ravishingly beautiful pictures of madame gianclis and mrs athelstone and hovering between them the materialized but homeless soul of madame blavatsky trying to make choice of an abiding place the whole enlivened and illuminated with much snappy reading matter now simpkins was the man to make a managing editor s dreams come true so naylor rubbed the lamp for him and told him what he craved but the reporter s success in life had been won by an ability to combine much extravagance of statement in the written with great conservatism in the spoken word early in his experience he had learned that naylor s optimism though purely professional entailed unpleasant consequences on the reporter who shared it and then betrayed some too generous trust so he absolutely refused to admit that there was any basis for it now you know she wo nt talk york boys have joshed that whole bunch so they re afraid to say their prayers out loud then she s english and dead swell and that combination s hard to open unless you have a number in the four hundred and then it ain t refined to try i can make a pass at her but it ll be a frost for me nonsense you must make her talk or manage to be around while some one else does naylor answered waving aside obstacles with the noble scorn of one whose business it is to set others to conquer them i want a good snappy interview understand and descriptions for some red hot pictures if you can t get photos i m going to save the spread in
meeting of two friends during it i had time to observe the king he wore the green uniform of a general with the jewel of the order of the lion around his neck his sixty odd years sat very lightly and left no mark save in the facial wrinkles and grey hair he was a true dalberg in height and general appearance and with the strong straight nose that was as distinctive to our family as was the beak to the bourbons i had remained in he turned and presented me i advanced and bowed as i straightened the king extended his hand saying we are glad to then he caught a full view of my face and stopped staring i dropped his hand and stepped back and for a space no one moved only i shot a side glance at courtney and caught a half smile on his lips then frederick recovered himself your pardon sir but i did not catch the name he said courtney s finesse saved me the embarrassment of a self introduction major dalberg of the united states army your majesty he said quickly the representative of our war department with your army dalberg dalberg he muttered then added perfunctorily our army is at your service sir though i fear we shall be unable to give you the war the army is quite enough sire i began he was studying my face again and thinking courtney i could see was having the finest sort of sport i could have throttled him you have our name major said the king may i ask if it is a common one in america i know of no family but my own that bears it there i answered he sat down and motioned for us to do likewise i am interested said he has your family been long in america since the year he leaned a bit forward that was during your revolutionary war yes your majesty it was that year lafayette joined washington s army that will give him a surprise i thought it did do you know the name of the dalberg of he asked quickly i saw no profit in evasion he was hugo second son of henry the knew it he exclaimed jumping up and coming over to me and you are his great grandson and eldest male heir then as such i salute you cousin he said and suddenly kissed me on the cheek were you ever kissed by a man if so and you are a woman it doubtless was pleasant enough and maybe not unusual but if you are a man it will surprise you mightily the first time of course i understood all the significance of frederick s action royalty on the continent so greets only royalty or relatives it meant i was accepted as one of the blood and a prince of my house i admit my pride was stirred your majesty overwhelms me i said bowing again i expected no recognition i am entitled to none our name was stricken from the family roll he made a deprecating gesture do and believe me also i had no intention to disclose my relationship i protested the king laughed you could not hide it with that face he said i must have flushed for he exclaimed ha you know that do you for answer i drew out the miniature of old henry which i had brought hoping for an opportunity to compare it with the original and handed it to him he gave it a quick glance and nodded yes that went with hugo he said i was surprised and looked it oh the family records are very complete as to the affair of your headstrong ancestor he explained old henry himself set it all out in his journal and he speaks of this very miniature as having been given to hugo by his mother the day he left dornlitz there were two of them copied from the portrait in the corridor he crossed one he said i glanced at courtney he threw up his hands in defeat at the same time however signifying that i should press my advantage while the king was so well disposed but i shook my head my descent had been acknowledged and that was quite enough more than enough indeed i had come to valeria as a major in the american army i sought no favors from the dalbergs here from which it would seem that a bit of hugo s stubborn independence had come down to me as for courtney the shrug of his shoulders was very eloquent of what he thought of such independence perchance you never heard of a certain letter dispatched to hugo by his brother frederick after henry s death the king asked and delivered by his ambassador i supplemented the same hugo too seems to have kept a journal he kept the letter itself and a copy of his altogether hugo must have been a rare fine fellow with a mind of his own he was a son of henry the third i answered the king nodded yet t was a pity he did not accept frederick s offer i fancy the new life was more to his mind doubtless but had he returned it would be you and not ferdinand of lotzen who would be the heir presumptive of valeria i smiled had he returned i would not be i true enough said he but think of the crown of your ancestors that might be yours it is enough to be a dalberg i have never thought of the crown i answered there spoke the son of hugo he said then suddenly he seemed to remember that we were not alone and springing up he sought out courtney who though to the remotest corner of the room my dear courtney he exclaimed i have been unpardonably rude i forgot you completely yet you brought it on yourself you
called the girl lazily achilles lifted the black tube the child beside him pressed close her eyes fixed on the tube achilles s words ran swift on the wire and her eager face held them other words came back sharp swift and the child heard them crackle and leap and break and crackle again in the misty depths and she touched achilles s arm softly they must not hurt mrs seabury she said you tell them not to hurt mrs seabury achilles s hand pressed her shoulder gently yes i tell they know it was a swift aside and his voice had taken up the tale that woman you not take that woman you hear yes she good woman tell them to look in the cellar said there is a hole there under a barrel and a barrel in the garden you tell them his eye dropped to her in cellar you say that yes yes her hands were clasped they took me there you tell them achilles s eye smiled hallo you look in cellar what you say no i do nt see it but you look in cellar yes they make tunnel yes he hung up the receiver and took her hand now we go home he said they passed swiftly out dropping payment into a sleepy unseeing palm and crossing the square to the car that should carry them home there were no delays now only swift running wheels a few jolts and stops and they were out again beneath the stars hurrying along the great breakwater of the lake hurrying home the big thin blackness and suddenly as they looked it was touched lightly as with a great finger and the dawn glowed mistily up the walls they crossed swiftly and mounted the steps between the lions the child s feet stumbling a little as they went but achilles s hand held fast and his touch on the bell summoned hurrying feet there was a fumbling at the chains a swift cautious creak and the door swung back who is it said a voice that peered out the dawn touched his face grotesquely it s me said the child it s betty harris conner the man s face fell back then he darted forward and glared at the child through the mysterious dawning light on the dark tender face and the little lip that trembled looking up my god he said he had darted from them the door was open wide and the two achilles led the child to a great divan across the hall and placed her beside him her little feet were crossed in the rough shoes and her hands hung listless behind a velvet curtain the butler s voice called frantic words a telephone bell rang sharply and whirred and rang a long fierce call and the butler s voice took it up and flung it back yes sir she s here yes sir that s what i said she s a settin here sir on the sofa with the furriner yes sir he put his head around the velvet curtain will you speak to your father miss his awe struck hand held the receiver and he helped the strange little figure to its seat in front of the phone she put the tube to her lips hallo daddy yes it s betty mr achilles brought me father yes yes your little betty yes from her fingers she had buried her face in her arms and was sobbing softly xxxvii the big bed achilles sprang forward she s all right mr harris all right his hand dropped to the trembling shoulder and rested there as his quiet voice repeated the words he bent forward and lifted the child in his arms and moved away with her but before he had traversed the long hall the little head had fallen forward on his shoulder and the child slept behind the velvet curtain the voice of conner wrestled faintly with the telephone and all about them great lights glowed on the walls they lighted the great staircase that swept mistily up and the figure of achilles mounting slowly in the stately lonely house the child in his arms his hand steadied the sleeping head with careful touch against his shoulder they were not jolting now in heavy cars through the traffic streets or wandering on the plain little betty harris had come stairs a grey figure appeared and paused a moment and looked down then miss stone descended swiftly her hands outstretched they did not touch the sleeping child but hovered above her with a look half pain half joy achilles smiled to her she come home he whispered she turned with quick breath and they mounted the stairs the child still asleep through the long corridor to the princess s room beyond with its soft lights and great silken hangings and canopied bed open for the night waiting for betty harris achilles bent and laid her down with lightest touch and straightened himself we let her sleep he said gently she very tired they stood looking down at the brown face and the little tired lip and sleeping lids their eyes met and they smiled they knew these two out of all the world they knew what it meant glowing dawn the great car thundered home and betty harris s mother looked out with swift eyes see phil the sun is up she reached out her hand sit still louie do nt tremble so he said gently she is safe now they have brought her home she s there you know asleep he spoke slowly as if to a child he was gathering up the morning in his heart this big harsh master of men his little girl was safe and a common greek a man out of the streets peddling bananas and calling up and down had made his life worth living his big tense mind gripped the fact and held it something
develop her plates in order to be sure that she had a perfect likeness before releasing the specimen for she did release all she produced except one pair of each kind never having sold a moth personally often where the markings were wonderful and complicated as soon as the wings were fully developed mrs porter copied the living specimen in water colours for her illustrations frequently making several copies in order to be sure that she laid on the colour enough brighter than her subject so that when it died it would be exactly the same shade never in all my life writes the author have i had such exquisite joy in work as i had in painting the illustrations for this volume of moths of the limberlost colour work had advanced to such a stage that i knew from the beautiful reproductions in arthur rackham s rheingold and valkyrie and several other books on the market that had assured me personally that i might count on exact reproduction and such details of type and paper as i chose to select i used the easel made for me when a girl under the supervision of my father and i threw my whole heart into the work of copying each line and delicate shading on those wonderful wings all diamonded with panes of quaint device innumerable stains and splendid dyes as one poet describes them there were times when in working a mist of colour over another background i cut a brush down to three hairs some of these illustrations i sent back six and seven times to be worked over before the illustration plates were exact duplicates of the originals and my heart ached for the engravers who must have had job like patience but it did not ache enough to stop me until i felt the reproduction exact this book tells its own story of long and patient waiting for a specimen of watching of disappointments and triumphs it represents my highest ideals in the making of a nature book and i can take any skeptic afield and prove the truth of the natural history it contains in august of the author s novel laddie was published in new york london sydney and toronto simultaneously this book contains the same mixture of romance and nature interest as the others and is modelled on the same plan of introducing nature objects peculiar to the location and characters many of whom are from life typical of the locality at a given period the first thing many critics said of it was that no such people ever existed and no such life was ever lived in reply to this the author said of a truth the home i described in this book i knew to the last grain of wood in the doors and i painted it with absolute accuracy and many of the people i described i knew more intimately than i ever have known any others picture of home life in a family who were reared and educated exactly as this book indicates there was such a man as laddie and he was as much bigger and better than my description of him as a real thing is always better than its presentment the only difference barring the nature work between my books and those of many other writers is that i prefer to describe and to perpetuate the best i have known in life whereas many authors seem to feel that they have no hope of achieving a high literary standing unless they delve in and reproduce the worst to deny that wrong and pitiful things exist in life is folly but to believe that these things are made better by promiscuous discussion at the hands of writers who fail to prove by their books that their viewpoint is either right clean or helpful is close to insanity if there is to be any error on either side in a book then god knows it is far better that it ideals than upon that of a too loose discussion of subjects which often open to a large part of the world their first knowledge of such forms of sin profligate expenditure and waste of life s best opportunities there is one great beauty in idealized romance reading it can make no one worse than he is while it may help thousands to a cleaner life and higher inspiration than they ever before have known mrs porter has written ten books and it is not out of place here to express her attitude toward them each was written she says from her heart s best impulses they are as clean and helpful as she knew how to make them as beautiful and interesting she has never spared herself in the least degree mind or body when it came to giving her best and she has never considered money in relation to what she was writing during the hard work and exposure of those early years during rainy days and many nights in the sending around the globe for books and delving to secure material for such books as birds of the bible music of the wild and moths of the limberlost every day devoted to such work was commercially lost as publishers did not fail to tell her but that was the work she could do and do with exceeding joy she could do it better pictorially on account of her lifelong knowledge of living things afield than any other woman had as yet had the strength and nerve to do it it was work in which she gloried and she persisted had i been working for money comments the author not one of these nature books ever would have been written or an illustration made when the public had discovered her and given generous approval to a girl of the limberlost when the harvester had established a new record that would have been the time for the author to
lacy answered listen here is the tale good exclaimed de wilton at the end she punished darby well i wish i could have seen it and it cut him suddenly he struck the wall sharply and yet she rides with him to day st george we are back where we started women are queer creatures just then sir james dacre stopped at the corridor door who is for a ride he asked i am said de lacy if sir ralph will excuse me de wilton nodded go by all means it was good of you to keep me company even for a moment i might venture to guess said dacre as they cantered across the bailey toward the gate that that black of yours was never foaled in england i got selim in spain de lacy answered and with him the story that he came from the stables of the soldan of granada but of that i can not vouch nor do i care patting the shining shoulder he is my good friend and companion and he has never failed with its bright full kind eye broad forehead tapered muzzle thin sensitive nostrils and ears at the arched neck the deep chest the rather short barrel the narrow waist powerful flanks and sinewy springy slender legs he is beautiful he said methinks i never saw so perfect a horse and his intelligence is in kind said aymer he has many accomplishments but the one most satisfactory to me is the way he understands my voice observe he dropped the reins over the pommel and at the word selim without touch of knee or shift of bit went through all the gaits and facings ending with the most difficult of all the seven artificial movements of the horse sir james dacre s rather cold face warmed with admiration and he reined over and stroked the black s soft muzzle you are a wonder selim he said your equal short dash the countess bay mare might put you to your speed very likely said aymer but i will wager there is none in england can beat him from the solway to land s end dacre smiled i would rather share the bet than take it then the talk led to the horses of france and spain and thence to the life there in general for sir james had never crossed the channel and he plied his companion with questions and so they jogged along in pleasant converse and de lacy saw that the reserved and quiet dacre was in fact as sincere and good hearted as the generously impulsive de wilton and he warmed to them both for he had anticipated cold looks hatred and jealousy such as under like conditions he would have met with on the continent and as they rode there came a faint hail from the front and thrice repeated the track at that point led through a wood and was straight the left just near the turn were two horsemen and the rearmost when he saw his cry had been heard waved his hat and gesticulated violently toward the other who was several lengths in front both were coming at top speed sir james dacre puckered his eyes and peered ahead my sight is rather poor he said but from yonder fellow s motions i take it he wants us to stop the other an escape doubtless just then the one in the lead shot through a patch of sunlight and both knights cried out a woman said de lacy the countess exclaimed dacre what may it mean she went riding with lord darby shortly after mid day said aymer and that is darby added dacre as the sun hit the second horseman pardieu i do not understand it can not be she is fleeing from him they drew rein and watched the she is succeeding aymer observed she is gaining on him at every jump st denis how that horse of hers can run it is wilda the bay mare i spoke of but see darby still waves what in heaven s name ails the man can it be the mare has bolted de lacy shook his head the countess is making no effort to control her the reins are hanging loose then they heard the first faint beat of the hoofs growing louder and louder and presently with it darby s cry stop her stop her maybe my lord said de lacy leaning forward his eyes intent upon the countess if the lady wish it she will signal two hundred yards away now came wilda running at terrific speed but straight and true suddenly de lacy swung selim around it is a runaway he called to dacre he said it the countess told him the same by a motion of her hand a moment more and she swept between them but beside her went the black leap for leap with the bay then aymer saw the trouble the bit had broken in the bar tearing the mouth badly and from each cheek strap dangled a useless half which striking the frightened mare on the muzzle kept driving her to top speed the countess gave de lacy a quick smile i am trying to enjoy it she said but i think i am dreadfully frightened aymer glanced at the road it was straight and level for another four hundred yards then it disappeared and he remembered it pitched sharply forward in a rough and twisting descent whatever he did must be done quickly no horse ever foaled could carry its rider down that declivity at such a speed death waits yonder he said pointing to the brow of the hill i must lift you to my saddle then suddenly loosed her foot from the stirrup i am ready she said and smiled again de lacy dropped his reins closer selim closer he commanded the black drew over until his master s boot was pressing the countess
he says to mrs steele there is a chorus of disappointment from the assembled crowd but mrs steele with evident reluctance says be left behind there s yellow fever in all these ports i m told place is full of it stay on the ship like sensible people there s nothing worth seeing in guatemala i hate to be bothered with passengers going off and the captain walks to the railing to wave his hand with stiff pomposity to a mexican who sits in the lighter you air meestake captain says the baron de bach all dthose vorkmen say it vill be two days loading this cafe the captain never very good tempered at the best of times is especially peppery to day are you runnin this ship young man or am i he seems to think he has made a forcible and irrefutable rejoinder and turns away like one who has settled something forever i vill spik with you inside the baron sets down his small valise and follows the apparently unheeding captain into the saloon we stand undecided looking and watching a stout mexican get into a huge barrel that has one side cut down and a seat fitted in a rope with huge iron hook attached is lowered from a pulley on the steamer and the barrel full of san jose official is lifted into the air the barrel twirls about the official puts his hand to his eyes and in a moment he is landed like a mammoth fish on the deck of the san miguel we hear the voices in the saloon rising with anger mrs steele looks apprehensive and makes a step towards the door out strides the baron looking hot and excited ladies ve vill go i promise you ve vill be back in time already the crowd is lessened and some have given up going even to san jose and several have made the trip in the barrel and are safely landed in the lighter i think we wo nt run any risk says mrs steele gently though we can go to i do assure you and the baron is most emphatic if you vill trust to go with me i see that you come safe back before san miguel sails the second mate comes up with an amused look you ladies jest go long th cap n s alwus like that nobuddy minds we ca nt get away under two days and he knows it we ai nt lowed to leave under forty eight hours on count o passengers from the coast that settles it and each in turn we go spinning down in the barrel and sit on piles of freight in the unsteady lighter the mexican oarsmen stand up and propel the boat through the surf with long oars it is rougher than it looks and i suffer my first touch of sea sickness we understand why we are anchored so far away and why the huge iron pier running out from san jose extends such a distance seawards i am quite faint and miserable when consumed with rage at the captain s interference he has no eyes happily for my pitiable condition i look about disconsolately for the barrel elevator for the pier is far above our heads and the great waves are dashing us against its iron side to mrs steele s horror we perceive a sort of iron cage is employed in the process of elevation at this end of the journey and soon we three are swinging in mid air between the angry waves and the iron pier oh i say breathlessly clutching at mrs steele what would uncle john say if he could see me now he would probably advise you to follow his example and make your observations from the outside of the cage i ve observed that mrs steele is sometimes lacking in sympathy at trying moments at last we are landed and at the end of the long pier we find a narrow gauge train strange primitive little cars and very dirty withal the windows and each one occupying a double seat for the carriage is only half full it s not more than seventy miles i believe says mrs steele but it takes five hours to get there it s an up hill grade all the way five hours i repeat dismayed oh why did no one tell me that before i had scarcely a mouthful of breakfast we haf another breakfast at escuintla mees a gude one says senor noma passing through our coach to the smoking car i am consoled and full of interest at the prospect as the dingy little train moves off mrs steele and i are facing each other while the baron sits behind me and points out the most noteworthy features of this notable expedition we are in the tropics truly the heat is overpowering and the baron leans over the back of my seat with my rough mazatlan fan and uses it with me do fan yourself a little i say you ve been the colour of a lobster ever since your interview with the captain the peruvian s brows contract he looks ferocious in the extreme and i am a little sorry i mentioned the captain dthat capitan ees von fool he know not how to treat a zhentleman i tell him i make a proces to the company and get him reprimand for how he spik to me why what did he say asks mrs steele he tell me i act like i vas capitan dthen he call me damn i tell him he vas a

in him deterioration is easy in the hills superficial deterioration in habits manners personal appearance and the practices of all the little niceties of life conditions of a mountain cabin and if possible might if practised excite wonder and comment if not vague suspicion sleeping garments are practically barred for the same reason shaving becomes a rare luxury a lost tooth brush may not be replaced for a month in time one may bring himself to eat with a knife for the reason that it is hard for a hungry man to feed himself with a fork that has but two tines the finger tips cease to be the culminating standard of the gentleman it is hard to keep a supply of fresh linen when one is constantly in the saddle and a constant weariness of body and a ravenous appetite make a man indifferent to things like a bad bed and worse food particularly as he must philosophically put up with them anyhow of all these things the man himself may be quite unconscious and yet they affect him more deeply than he knows and show to a woman even in his voice his walk his mouth everywhere save in his kindliness or when there has been some serious break down of soul or character within and the woman will not look to his eyes for the truth which makes its way slowly particularly when the woman has striven for the very things that the man has so recklessly let go she would never suffer herself to let down in such a way and she does not understand how a man can hale s life since his college doors had closed behind him had always been a rough one he had dropped from civilization and had gone back into it many times and each time he had dropped he dropped the deeper and for that reason had come back into his own life each time with more difficulty and with more indifference the last had been his roughest year and he had sunk a little more deeply just at the time when june had been pluming herself for flight from such depths forever moreover hale had been dominant in every matter that his hand or his brain had touched his habit was done though he was no longer acting captain of the police guard he always acted as captain whenever he was on hand and always he was the undisputed leader in all questions of business politics or the maintenance of order and law the success he had forged had hardened and strengthened his mouth steeled his eyes and made him more masterful in manner speech and point of view and naturally had added nothing to his gentleness his unselfishness his refinement or the nice consideration of little things on which women lay such stress it was an hour by sun when he clattered through the gap and pushed his tired black horse into a gallop across the valley toward the town he saw the smoke of the little dummy and as he thundered over the bridge of the north fork he saw that it was just about to pull out and he waved his hat and shouted imperiously for it to wait with his hand on the bell rope the conductor autocrat that he reins to the man who was nearest hardly seeing who he was and climbed aboard he wore a slouched hat spotted by contact with the roof of the mines which he had hastily visited on his way through lonesome cove the growth of three days beard was on his face he wore a gray woollen shirt and a blue handkerchief none too clean was loosely tied about his sun scorched column of a throat he was spotted with mud from his waist to the soles of his rough riding boots and his hands were rough and grimy but his eye was bright and keen and his heart thumped eagerly again it was the middle of june and the town was a naked island in a sea of leaves whose breakers literally had run mountain high and stopped for all time motionless purple lights thick as mist veiled powell s mountain below the valley was still flooded with yellow sunlight which lay along the mountain sides and was streaked here and there with the long shadow of a deep ravine the bodies scantily draped with green and the yawning gap held the yellow light as a bowl holds wine he had long ago come to look upon the hills merely as storehouses for iron and coal put there for his special purpose but now the long submerged sense of the beauty of it all stirred within him again for june was the incarnate spirit of it all and june was coming back to those mountains and to him and june june had seen the change in hale the first year he had come often to new york to see her and they had gone to the theatre and the opera and june was pleased to play the part of heroine in what was such a real romance to the other girls in school and she was proud of hale but each time he came he seemed less interested in the diversions that meant so much to her more absorbed in his affairs in the mountains and less particular about his looks his visits came at and each time he seemed more eager to get away she had been shy about appearing before him for the first time in evening dress and when he entered the drawing room she stood under a chandelier in blushing and resplendent confusion but he seemed not to recognize that he had never seen her that way before and for another reason june remained confused disappointed and hurt for he was not only unobserving and seemingly unappreciative but he was more silent than ever that night and he looked gloomy but
he a railroad king she whispered in a mocking awe stricken voice is he rich oh rich as solomon and is he a terrible man who eats people alive all the time yes said montague that must be the one well said betty he has done me the honour to be my granddaddy but do nt you take any letter of introduction to perplexed because he ll eat you said the girl he hates ollie dear me said the other and the girl asked do you mean that the boy has nt said a word about me no said montague i suppose he left it for you to do well said betty it s like a fairy story do you ever read fairy stories in this story there was a princess oh the most beautiful princess do you understand yes said montague she wore a red rose in her hair and then said the girl there was a young courtier very handsome and gay and they fell in love with each other but the terrible old king he wanted his daughter to wait a while until he got through conquering his enemies so that he might have time to pick who was wasting his lands do you follow me perfectly said he and then did the beautiful princess pine away um no said betty pursing her lips but she had to dance terribly hard to keep from thinking about herself then she laughed and exclaimed dear me we are getting poetical and next looking sober again do you know i was half afraid to talk to you ollie tells me you re terribly serious are you i do nt know said montague but she broke in with a laugh we were talking about you at dinner last night they had some whipped cream done up in funny little curliques and ollie said now if my brother allan were here he d be thinking about the man who fixed this cream and how long it took him and how he might have been reading it involves a question of literary criticism said montague i do nt want to talk about literature exclaimed the other in truth she wanted nothing save to feel of his armour and find out if there were any weak spots through which he could be teased montague was to find in time that the adorable miss elizabeth was a very thorny species of rose she was more like a gay coloured wasp of predatory temperament ollie says you want to go down town and work she went on i think you re awfully foolish is nt it much nicer to spend your time in an imitation castle like this perhaps said he but i have nt any castle you might get one answered betty stay around awhile and let us marry you to a nice girl they will all throw themselves at your feet you know for you have such a delicious melting voice made a note to inquire whether it was customary in new york to talk about you so frankly to your face miss betty was surveying him quizzically meantime i do nt know she said on second thoughts maybe you ll frighten the girls then it ll be the married women who ll fall in love with you you ll have to watch out i ve already been told that by my tailor said montague with a laugh that would be a still quicker way of making your fortune said she but i do nt think you d fit in the role of a tame cat a what he exclaimed and miss betty laughed do nt you know what that is dear me how charmingly naive but perhaps you d better get ollie to explain for you that brought the conversation to the subject of slang and montague in a sudden burst of confidence utterance she said he repeated slowly that when i got to be pally with her i d conclude she did nt furnish oh yes said miss wyman she just meant that when you knew her you d be disappointed you see she picks up all the race track slang one ca nt help it you know and last year she took her coach over to england and so she s got all the english slang that makes it hard even for us and then betty sailed in to entertain him with little sketches of other members of the party a phenomenon that had struck montague immediately was the extraordinary freedom with which everybody in new york discussed everybody else as a matter of fact one seldom discussed anything else and it made not the least difference though the person were one of your set though he ate your bread and salt and you ate his still and humiliating and terrifying things about him there was poor clarrie mason clarrie sitting in at bridge with an expression of feverish eagerness upon his pale face clarrie always lost and it positively broke his heart though he had ten millions laid by on ice clarrie went about all day bemoaning his brother who had been kidnapped had montague not heard about it well the newspapers called it a marriage but it was really a kidnapping poor larry mason was good natured and weak in the knees and he had been carried off by a terrible creature three times as big as himself and with a temper like oh there were no words for it she had been an actress and now she had carried larry away in her talons and was building a big castle to keep him in for he had ten millions too alas and then there was bertie stuyvesant beautiful and winning the boy who had sat opposite montague at and nobody knew how many millions he had left bertie was gay last week he had invited them to a brook trout breakfast in november and that had been a
he would never agree to a plan of that sort it was therefore necessary for her to deceive him in more ways than one plainly speaking brock had laboured under the delusion that she merely proposed to bribe the gaoler into letting him off for the night in order that by some hook or crook they could be married early in the morning provided her conception of the state marriage laws as they applied to aliens was absolutely correct it was not correct it may be well to state although that has nothing to do with the case at this moment if he had but known that she contemplated paying ten thousand and that he was expected to catch a night train across the border it is only just to his manhood to say that he should have balked even though the act were to cost him years of prison servitude which of course was unlikely in the face of the explanation that would be made in proper time by the real medcroft it thus may be seen that brock not only had been vilely imprisoned twice in the same night but that he was very much in the dark notwithstanding his attempt to make light of the situation it occurred to him at two o clock that pacing the floor in the agony of suspense was a very useless occupation he would go to bed morning would bring relief and surcease to his troubled mind constance was doubtless sound asleep in her room everything would have been explained to her long before this hour she would understand so with the return of his old sophistry he undressed and crawled into the strange bed somehow in the balcony below just as he was dropping off into the long delayed slumber he heard a light tapping at his door he sat up in bed like a flash thoroughly wide awake the rapping was repeated he called out in cautious tones asking who was there at the same time slipping from bed to fumble in the darkness for his clothes sh came from the hallway he rushed over and put his ear to the door it is i are you awake i ca nt stay here it s wrong listen here is a note under the door good night darling i m heartbroken thank god it s you he cried softly how i love you constance sh edith is with me oh i wish it were morning and i could see you i have so much to say another querulous voice broke in for heaven s our reputations are bad enough as it is good night roxbury he distinctly heard the heartless edith giggle then came the soft quick swish of garments and the nocturnal visitors were gone he picked up the envelope and waiting until they were safely down the hall turned on the light dearest he read it was not my fault and i know it was not yours but oh you do nt know how i suffered all through those hours of waiting at the cafe they did not find me until after two they were drunk they tried to explain what do you think the authorities will do to me if they find that i gave that horrid man bribe money really i m terribly nervous but he wo nt dare say anything will he he is as guilty as i for he took it he took it knowing that you were free at the time but we will talk it over to morrow would nt go to bed until edith brought me up to hear your dear voice i am so glad you are not dead it is impossible to release you to night those wretches have the key how i loathe them edith says the hotel is wild with gossip about everything and everybody it s just awful be of good heart my beloved i will be your faithful slave until death with love and adoration and kisses your own constance p s roxbury has not made a sign edith is frantic several floors below the relieved and ecstatic brock mrs medcroft was soon urging her sister to go to bed and let the story go until daylight she persisted in telling all that she had done and all that she had endured we must never let him know that we actually gave that wretch nearly twenty five hundred dollars edith he would never forgive us i admit that i was a fool and a ninny so do nt tell me i looking that you re just crazy to it s all roxbury s fault anyway why should he get up and make a speech in london without letting us know just see how it has placed us i think mr brock is an angel to do what he has done for you and roxbury yes my dear you will have to confess that roxbury is a brute a perfect brute i m sure if you have a spark of fairness in you you must hate him no no do nt say anything edith you know i m right i m not going to say anything declared edith angrily i m going to bed edith if you do nt mind dear i think i ll sleep with you after a moment of deep reflection she added plaintively there is so much that i just have to tell you deary it it wo nt keep till daylight bright and were routed from their rooms by a demand from the management of the hotel that they appear forthwith in the private office this order included every member of mr rodney s party excepting the medcroft baby considerably distressed and very much concerned over the probable outcome of the conference the rodney forces made their way to the offices not altogether in an open fashion but by humiliatingly unusual avenues the rodney family came down the back stairs brock

lip meditatively let me see one of those mexican mines is nt it or wait a moment shrewdly i may have mines on the brain because we ve been talking about them upon my word hayden his face flushing with shame his professional pride sadly wounded i m awfully sorry but to tell the truth i ca nt just put my finger on it yet somewhere lately i ve heard of it did i read of it or hear people speaking of it he drew his hand over his brow looking really worried come on and walk down the avenue with me he said maybe the night air will refresh my memory and i ll be able to think it out could hardly be regarded as a potent factor in restoring penfield s recollections for they walked some distance and he had succeeded in offering no answer to hayden s question and although he strove lightly to discuss the various topics which arose between them he was manifestly so perturbed and dismayed that hayden felt his contempt mitigated by a faint touch of pity finally when about to cross from one side of the street to the other they paused to give an oncoming motor the right of way as it went flying past them a woman leaned forward and bowed and smiled it was the lady of the butterflies and in the white light of the electric lamp hayden saw seated beside her the same gray elderly unobtrusive man with whom she had entered the gildersleeve by george marcia oldham cried penfield marcia oldham what a coincidence what luck hayden exulted so kitty s fairy princess and his fairy princess were identical it was surely one of the should have an opportunity to prove that cousinly affection of which she was always assuring him you know her of course asked penfield i have recently met her replied hayden briefly queer thing about that family meditated penfield queer how what do you mean exclaimed hayden involuntarily although he bitterly reproached himself a moment later for having as he expressed it so far forgotten himself as to ask any questions of penfield penfield chuckled an arid biting chuckle it was too his face brightened up his crestfallen manner merged happily into jauntiness his self respect was restored he was again the authoritative gossip you know of course of old oldham one of the millionaires of the last decade well with changing times changing methods of finance he lost his grip and about five years ago he died heavily involved leaving a widow and one young daughter marcia regime and was a pretty absolutely helpless creature and marcia was still at school of course it raised a storm of talk they had been used to every luxury all the ease of wealth they relied on the machinery you know to look after them and it never entered into their heads that the wheels could stop when they did stop as you can imagine every one was discussing the poor oldhams there was the greatest raising of hands and lowering of voices and mopping of eyes whenever their names were mentioned his arid chuckle seemed to strike hayden like the spatter of hail what will become of them what can they do a helpless woman like mrs oldham and a young daughter he mimicked feminine voices you heard that sort of thing bleated on every side all the women advanced positive opinions on just what they ought to do the consensus i believe amounted to the oldhams to sell everything they had left and depart for some obscure german or french town where marcia might perfect herself in the languages and fit herself for a nursery governess or something of that kind but again a fit of laughing which almost choked him to the disapproval even horror and disgust of all kind friends the eccentric oldhams did nothing of the kind they went along as they always had and certainly they did not then display nor ever have displayed any lack of money they live simply entertain very little but marcia who is considered a beauty goes out constantly she is seen everywhere dresses quite as well as her school friends kitty hampton and bea habersham with whom she always appears and who as of course you know have both married enormous amounts of money her extravagance is hardly discreet considering a watchful and censorious world but when one has such powerful and extremely loyal friends discretion is unnecessary indignantly penfield s thin laughter stabbed his ear drums if she sold in a year all the pretty little pictures she paints it would barely pay for her gowns no that wo nt do but and a new note crept into penfield s voice did you see that old duffer who was with her that s where she shows her discretion he is kept very much in the background it is only occasionally that she appears with him who is he asked hayden gruffly desperately ashamed of himself for stooping to question penfield penfield elevated his eyebrows and spread his hands let us hope that he is the rich uncle from australia he said gently ah hayden bea and kitty have managed the affair with wilfred ames beautifully so far they have almost succeeded in pulling it off in spite of the reluctant lady and wilfred s raving mother but wilfred good old thick witted wilfred is becoming daily to sleep on the hearth rug as kitty and bea wish him to on the contrary owing to his mother s watchful vigilance he is sniffing around quite suspiciously and with a series of chuckles i believe although i am not sure yet that the fair marcia has a rival and a rival to be reckoned with i assure you hayden felt he had stood all that he could penfield really was too offensive his first impulse was to turn on his heel and leave
extremity of need bright ominous accusing she seized it augustine augustine what of him sir hugh s voice had an edge to it he could not bear it it would break his heart what has he to do with it he is nt all your life you ve given him most of it already he is he must be all my life except that beautiful part that you were that you are oh you will stay my friend i ll stay your lover your determined lover and husband amabel darling you are ridiculous enchanting with your barriers your scruples her fanned his ardour to flame his arms once more went round her he murmured words of lover like pleading rapturous wild and foolish and though her love her sacred love for him was there his love for her was a nightmare to her now she had lost herself and it was as though she lost him while he pleaded thus and again and again she answered resolute and tormented no no never never do not speak so to me do not i beg of you suddenly he released her he straightened himself and moved away from her a little someone had entered amabel dropped her hands and raised her eyes at last augustine stood before them augustine had on still his long travelling coat his cap beaded with raindrops was in his hand his yellow hair was ruffled he had entered hastily he stood there looking at them transfixed yet not astonished of them spoke sir hugh did not move further from his wife s side he was neither anxious nor confused but his face wore an involuntary scowl the deep confusion was amabel s but her husband had released her no longer pleaded and with the lifting of that dire oppression the realities of her life flooded her almost with relief it was impossible this gay this facile this unseemly love but as she rejected and put it from her the old love was the stronger cherished the more closely in atonement and solicitude the man shrunk from and repulsed and in all the deep confusion before her son that he should find her so almost in her husband s arms a flash of clarity went through her mind as she saw them thus confronted deeper than ever between her and augustine was the challenge of her love and his hatred but it was that sacred love that now needed safeguards she could not feel was her refuge from oppression she rose and went to him and timidly clasped his arm dear augustine i am so glad you have come back i have missed you so he stood still not responding to her touch but as she held him he looked across the room at sir hugh you wrote you missed me that s why i came sir hugh now strolled to the fire and stood before it turning to face augustine s gaze unperturbed quite at ease how wet you are dear said amabel take off this coat augustine stripped it off and flung it on a chair she could hear his quick breathing he did not look at her and still it seemed to her that it was his anger rather than his love that protected her he will want to change dearest said sir hugh from before the fire and i want to finish his mother at the blush that overwhelmed her as that possessive word was spoken do you want me to go no dear no it is only the coat that is wet is nt it do nt go i want to see you of course after your absence hugh you will excuse us it seems such a long time since i saw him you and i will finish our talk on another day or i will write to you she knew what it must look like to her husband this weak recourse to the protection of augustine s presence it looked like bashfulness a further feminine wile made up of self deception and allurement a putting off of final surrender for the greater sweetness of delay and as the reading of him flashed through her it brought a strange pang of shame for him of regret for something spoiled sir hugh took out his watch and looked at it come back for me at five fifteen you ll give me some tea dearest of course it is time now augustine will you ring the miserable blush covered her again the tea came and they were silent while the maid set it out augustine had thrown himself into a chair and stared before him sir hugh very much in possession kept his place before the fire catching amabel s eye he smiled at her he was completely assured how should he not be what for his seeing could stand between them now when the maid was gone and amabel was making tea he came and stood over her his hands in his pockets his handsome head bent to her talking lightly slightly jesting his voice pitched intimately for her ear yet not so intimately that any unkindness of exclusion should appear augustine could hear all he said and gauge how deep was an intimacy that could wear such lightness meanwhile looked at neither his mother nor sir hugh turned from them in his chair he put out his hand for his tea and stared before him as if unseeing and unhearing while he drank it it was for her sake amabel knew that sir hugh raising his voice presently as though aware of the sullen presence made a little effort to lift the gloom what sort of a time have you had augustine he asked was the weather at haversham as bad as everywhere else augustine did not turn his head in replying quite as bad i fancy you and young wallace hammered at metaphysics i suppose we did nice lad to this augustine
through the old wicked looking streets on the other side of the river i am only sorry that my new friends my french family do not live in the old city au coeur du vieux paris as they say here they live only in the boulevard haussman which is less picturesque but in spite of this they have a great deal of the balzac tone madame de maisonrouge belongs to one of the oldest and proudest families in france but she has had reverses which have compelled her to open an establishment in which a limited number of travellers who are weary of the beaten track who have the sense of local colour she explains it herself she expresses it so well in short to open a sort of boarding house i do nt see why i should not after all use that expression for it is the correlative of the term pension bourgeoise employed by balzac in the madame vauquer nee de conflans but this establishment is not at all like that and indeed it is not at all bourgeois there is something distinguished something aristocratic about it the pension vauquer was dark brown sordid graisseuse but this is in quite a different tone with high clear lightly draped windows tender subtle almost morbid colours and furniture in elegant studied reed like lines madame de maisonrouge reminds me of madame hulot do you remember la belle madame hulot in les barents pauvres she has a great charm a little artificial a little fatigued with a little suggestion of hidden things in her life but i have always been sensitive to the charm of fatigue of duplicity i am rather disappointed i confess in the society i find here it is not so local so characteristic as i could have desired indeed to tell the truth it is not local at is cosmopolitan and there is a great advantage in that we are french we are english we are american we are german and i believe there are some russians and hungarians expected i am much interested in the study of national types in comparing contrasting seizing the strong points the weak points the point of view of each it is interesting to shift one s point of view to enter into strange exotic ways of looking at life the american types here are not i am sorry to say so interesting as they might be and excepting myself are exclusively feminine we are thin my dear harvard we are pale we are sharp there is something meagre about us our line is wanting in roundness our composition in richness we lack temperament we do nt know how to live nous ne savons pas vivre as they say here the american temperament is represented putting myself not at all american by a young girl and her mother and another young girl without her mother without her mother or any attendant or appendage whatever these young girls are rather curious types they have a certain interest they have a certain grace but they are disappointing too they do nt go far they do nt keep all they promise they do nt satisfy the imagination they are cold slim sexless the physique is not generous not abundant it is only the drapery the skirts and furbelows that is i mean in the young lady who has her mother that are abundant they are very different one of them all elegance all expensiveness with an air of high fashion from new york the other a plain pure clear eyed straight waisted straight stepping maiden from the heart of new england and yet they are very much alike too more alike than they would care to think themselves for they eye each are both specimens of the emancipated young american girl practical positive passionless subtle and knowing as you please either too much or too little and yet as i say they have a certain stamp a certain grace i like to talk with them to study them the fair new yorker is sometimes very amusing she asks me if every one in boston talks like me if every one is as intellectual as your poor correspondent she is for ever throwing boston up at me i ca nt get rid of boston the other one rubs it into me too but in a different way she seems to feel about it as a good mahommedan feels toward mecca and regards it as a kind of focus of light for the whole human race poor little boston what nonsense is talked in thy name but this new england maiden is in her way a strange type she is travelling all over says for herself for herself what can that stiff slim self of hers do with such sights such visions she looks at everything goes everywhere passes her way with her clear quiet eyes wide open skirting the edge of obscene abysses without suspecting them pushing through brambles without tearing her robe exciting without knowing it the most injurious suspicions and always holding her course passionless stainless fearless charmless it is a little figure in which after all if you can get the right point of view there is something rather striking by way of contrast there is a lovely english girl with eyes as shy as violets and a voice as sweet she has a sweet gainsborough head and a great gainsborough hat with a mighty plume in front of it which makes a shadow over her quiet english eyes then she has a sage green robe mystic wonderful all embroidered with subtle devices straight and tight in front and adorned behind along the spine with large strange iridescent buttons the revival of taste of the sense of beauty in england interests me deeply what is there in a simple row of spinal buttons to make one dream to donnor a rever as they say here i think that a great aesthetic renascence
until the great day comes when two may enter it together as theseus carried the thread of ariadne through the labyrinth of crete there are many who attempt to find the secret chamber but vainly for the thread will always break in the wrong heart when the door is opened way through the devious passages there is so little to be seen that sometimes even the man himself laughs the woman to scorn and despoils her of her few treasures the secret chamber is only a bare white room where is erected the high altar of her soul served through life by her own faith upon the altar burns steadfastly the one light waiting for him who at last has come and consecrated in his name the door of the sanctuary is rock ribbed and heavy and he who has not the key may beat and call in vain while within unheeding the woman guards her light pitifully often the man does not care sometimes he does not even suspect that he has been admitted into the inmost sanctuary of her heart for there are men who may never know what sanctuary means nor what the opening of the door has cost but the man who is worthy will kneel at the altar for a moment with the woman beside him and him he may go in sometimes with her to warm his hands at those divine fires and kindle his failing courage anew when the sanctuary is not profaned by him who has come hither its blessedness is increased ten fold it takes on a certain divinity by being shared and thereafter they serve the light together and yet through woman s eager trustfulness the man who opens the door is not always the one divinely appointed to open it sometimes the light fails and the woman weeping in the darkness is left alone in her profaned temple never to open its door again or after many years to set another light high upon the altar and in the deepening shadows pray so because the door had never been opened and because she knew the man had come at last who might enter the sanctuary with her rose lifted her ever burning light that night to the high altar of her soul and set herself to wait until son the house seemed very quiet though steadily from a distant upper room came the sound of a violin for more than an hour allison had worked continuously at one difficult phrase colonel kent smiled whimsically as he sat in the library thinking that by this time he could almost play it himself looking back over the thirty years he could see where he had made mistakes in moulding the human clay entrusted to his care yet in the end the mistakes had not mattered back in the beginning he had formulated certain cherished ideals for his son and had worked steadily toward them unmindful of occasional difficulties and even failures against his own judgment he had yielded to francesca in the choice of the boy s career look at his hands she had said you could nt put hands like his at work in an office if he is nt meant for music we ll find it out soon enough chosen path with never a question or doubt of his ultimate success just now the colonel was deeply grateful to francesca for the years abroad had been pleasant ones and would have been wholly impossible had allison been working in an office with a sigh he began to pace back and forth through the hall his hands in his pockets and his grey head bowed before him was his own portrait in uniform his hand upon his sword the sword itself hanging in a corner of the hall was dull and lifeless now he had a curious sense that his work was done the tiny stream rising from some cool pool among the mountains is not unlike man s own beginning for at first it gives no hint of its boundless possibilities grown to a river taking to itself the water from a thousand secret channels it leaps down the mountain heedless of rocky barriers with all the joy of lusty youth the its accumulation of driftwood its unsuspected depths and its crystalline shallows singing in the summer sun barriers may be built across its path but they bring only power as the conquering of an obstacle is always sure to do sometimes when the rocks and stone clad hills loom large ahead and eternity itself would be needed to carve a passage there is an easy way around the discovery of it makes the river sing with gladness and turns the murmurous deeps to living water bright with ripples and foam ultimately too in spite of rocks and driftwood of endless seeking for a path of tempestuous nights and days of ice and snow man and the river reach the eternal sea to be merged forever with the everlasting upstairs the music ceased a door opened then closed and presently allison came down rubbing his hands it s a little cool up there he said and yet by the calendar it s even then we would nt be satisfied the colonel returned who wants all his days to be alike nobody still it s a bit trying to freeze your nose one day and be obliged to keep all the windows open the next there was a long pause the colonel tapped his fingers restlessly upon the library table allison went over to the open fire and stood with his back to it clasping his hands behind him what have you been doing all the morning dad nothing just sitting here thinking pretty hopeless occupation unless you have something in particular to think about it s better to have nothing to think about than to be obliged to think of something unpleasant is nt it i do nt know
know a dead cat when i see one now mebby said flannery shortly mebby an mebby not but do ye know where doc pomeroy hangs out go an fetch him as timmy passed the box on the way out he looked at the cat with renewed interest he began to have a slight doubt that he might not know a dead cat when he saw one after all if flannery was going to have a veterinary come to look at it but the cat certainly looked dead extremely dead doc pomeroy was a tall lank man with a slouch in his shoulders and a sad hollow chested voice his voice was the deepest and mournfullest bass the boy says you want me to look at a cat he said in his hopeless tone where s the cat and doc pomeroy stood at the other side he did not even bend down to look at the cat that cat s dead he said without emotion av course it is said flannery t was dead th firrst time i seen it the boy said you wanted me to look at a cat said doc pomeroy sure said flannery sure i did that s th cat i wanted ye t see th cat what might be yer opinion av it what do you want me to do with the cat asked doc pomeroy look at it said flannery pleasantly nawthin but look at it thim is me orders have a veterinary look at th cat is what they says an i can see be th look on ye that t is yer opinion t is a mighty the veterinary slowly is as dead as it can be a cat ca nt be any deader than that one is it can not said flannery positively but it can be longer dead if i had a cat that had been dead longer than that cat has been dead said doc pomeroy as he moved away i would nt have to see it to know that it was dead a cat that has been dead longer than that cat has been dead lets you know it that cat will let you know it pretty quick now thank ye said flannery an ye have had a good look at it ye w u d nt like t look at it again mebby thim is me orders t allow ixamination be th veterinary an if t w u d be anny comfort t ye i will draw up a chair so ye can look all ye want to face and let them rest there a moment much obliged he said but he did not look at the cat again he went back to his headquarters that afternoon flannery and timmy began walking quickly when they passed the box and toward evening when flannery had to make out his reports he went out on the back porch and wrote them using a chair seat for a desk one of his tasks was to write a letter to the new york office w b he wrote the vetinnary has seen the cat and its diseased all right he says so no sine of mrs warman yet but ile keep the cat in the offis if you say so as long as i cann stand it but how cann i feed a diseased cat i nevver fed a diseased cat yet what do you feed cats lik that the next morning when flannery reached the office he opened the front door and immediately closed it with as usual flannery stood a minute looking at the door and then he sat down on the edge of the curb to wait for timmy the boy came along after a while indolently as usual but when he saw flannery he quickened his pace a little what s th matter he asked locked out flannery stood up he did not even say good morning he ran his hand into his pocket and pulled out the key timmy he said gently almost lovingly i have business that takes me t th other side av town i have th confidence in ye timmy t let ye open up th office t will be good ixperience fer ye he cast his eye down the street where the car line made a turn around the corner the trolley wire was shaking th way ye open up he said slowly is t push th key in timmy an thin turrn it t th lift wait he called as timmy turned t is important t turrn t th lift not th right an whin ye have th door open the car was rounding the corner and flannery stepped into the street whin ye have th door open th door open the car was where he could touch it take th cat out behind th office an bury it an if ye do nt i ll fire ye out av yer job mind that the car sped by and flannery swung aboard timmy watched it until it went out of sight around the next corner and then he turned to the office door he pushed the key in and turned it to the left when flannery returned the cat was gone and so was timmy the grocer next door handed flannery the he opened the door of the office and for a moment he was sure the cat was not gone but it was flannery could not see the box it was gone he threw open the back door and let the wind sweep through the office and it blew a paper off the desk flannery picked it up and read it it was from timmy mike flannery esquire it said take youre old job im tired of the express bisiness too much cats and missus warmans in it im going to new york to look for a decent job i berried the cat for you but no more for me youres
you pray for i said oh lord do not make me rich but place me next to the rich and he kept on his way rubbing his hands and chuckling and yet i must say it is worth the price i have no need of a william here nor of anybody else the water for my cups is within my reach convenient umbrellas on movable pedestals can be shoved into place a sheltered back porch hives for the night all my paraphernalia and unfinished sketches and a step lobster fresh from the sea and a peculiar peach ablaze in a peculiar sauce the whole washed down by a pint of no you ca nt have the brand there were only seven bottles left when i paid my bill and besides i am going back help to ease the cares that beset a painter s life but even this oasis of a garden hemmed about as if by the froth of trouville and the suds of cabourg through which floats the gay life of paris resplendent in toilets never excelled or exceeded anywhere can not keep me from holland very long and it is a pity too for of late years i have been looked upon as a harmless fixture at the inn so much so that men and women pass and repass my easel or look over my shoulder while i work without a break in their confidences quite as if i was a deaf dumb and blind waiter or twin brother to old coco the cockatoo who has for the past thirty years none of these unconscious ear droppings am i going to betray delightful startling improper if you must have it as some of them were not the most interesting at all events for i promised her i would nt but there is no question as to the diversion obtained by keeping the latch string of your ears on the outside none of all this ever drips into my auricles in holland a country so small that they build dikes to keep the inhabitants from being spilt off the edge is hardly the place for a scandal certainly not in stolid dordrecht or in that fly speck of a papendrecht whose dormer windows peer over the edge of the dike as if in mortal fear of another inundation and yet small as it is it is still big enough for me to approach it the fly speck of course by half a dozen different routes i can come by boat from rotterdam fop smit owns and runs it or by train from amsterdam or by carriage from any number of dams drechts and bergs or i can tramp it on foot or be wheeled in on a dog wagon i have tried them all and know being now a staid old painter and past such foolishness i take the train toot toot and i am out on the platform through the door of the station and aboard the one horse tram that wiggles and swings over the cobble scoured streets of dordrecht and so on to the bellevue why i stop at the bellevue apart from it being one of my inns is that from its windows i can not only watch the life of the tawny colored boat crowded maas but see every curl of smoke that mounts from the chimneys of papendrecht strung along its opposite bank my dear friend herr boudier of years gone by has retired from its ownership but his successor herr teitsma is as hearty in pulled his last oar some two years back and one bop takes his place there is another p and an e tacked on to bop but i have eliminated the unnecessary and call him bob for short they made bob out of what was left of peter but they left out all trace of william this wooden shod curiosity is anywhere from seventy to one hundred and fifty years old gray knock kneed bent in the back and goes to sleep standing up and stays asleep he is the exact duplicate of the tramp in the comic opera of miss hook of holland except that the actor sleeper occasionally topples over and has to be braced up bob is past master of the art and goes it alone without propping of any kind he is the only man in dordrecht or papendrecht or the country round about who can pull a boat and speak english he says so and i am forced not he wants it in advance too having had some experience with painter man he explains to herr teitsma i shall of course miss my delightful william but i am accustomed to that and then again while bob asleep is an interesting physiological study bob awake adds to the gayety of nations samples of which crowd about my easel holland being one of the main highways of the earth i have known dort and the little drecht across the way for some fifteen years five of which have slipped by since i last opened my umbrella along its quaint quays to my great joy nothing has changed the old potato boat still lies close to the quay under the overhanging elms the same dear old man and his equally dear old wife still make their home beneath its hipped roof i know for it is here i lunch the cargo forming the chief dish followed by a saucer of stewed currants a cup of coffee of bread from the baker s the old groote kirk still towers aloft the highest building in holland they say the lazy red sailed luggers drift up and down their decks gay with potted plants swiss curtains at the cabin windows the wife holding the tiller while the man trims the sail the boys still clatter over the polished cobbles an aggressive mob when school lets out and a larger crop i think than in the years gone by
possibility of further conversation just then and as soon as the curtain was down and the applause had ceased stephen langdon left his chair and reached for his coat and hat then he addressed the two young if you two youngsters care to see this out i ll leave you here together he said i have just remembered something i should have attended to to night i must see melvin my lawyer you wo nt mind beatrice will you if i leave you in roderick s care possibly i ll return before the show is out before either of them could answer langdon had passed out into the aisle and hurried away leaving duncan and miss brunswick alone together in the box if roderick duncan had really desired an opportunity to confide his troubles to beatrice it was afforded him then but now that it was at hand he felt suddenly uncertain about the wisdom of such a proceeding chapter iv the box at the opera duncan stared helplessly at the spot where the curtains had fallen together behind the departing figure of stephen langdon then he turned his eyes toward beatrice to discover that she was convulsed with laughter but levity had been excited by the departure of the banker or by duncan s attitude of dismay the young man could not have told he laughed with her for there was a distinctly ludicrous side to the situation following as it did so closely upon the announcement of his engagement to patricia by mutual consent they withdrew to the rear of the box and then beatrice with a touch of teasing witchery in her voice and with laughter still in her eyes asked him do nt you think that this is rather a compromising situation particularly in view of the fact that you have only just become engaged to patricia really you know it is dreadful is nt it i had nt thought of that he replied quite truthfully i was thinking of what langdon said when he left us it recalled something about leaving us two youngsters alone together she asked him with no that was nt the last thing he said what was it i did nt hear it he said he was going to see melvin i suppose you know who melvin is do nt you oh yes indeed mr melvin and i are great friends i think he is about the nicest old gentleman of my acquaintance do nt you he is what i should call the arbiter elegantiarum of the langdon court if one could imagine old steve as a caesar and patricia as beatrice paused and flushed hotly she had not considered to what length her words were reaching she had almost cast a reflection upon her friend which would have been as unkind as it was unmerited she added quickly but why if i may ask did the mention of mr melvin s name interest you duncan gazed at his companion rather stupidly for a moment for his mind had suddenly he had forgotten for the time being where he was and with whom he was talking but beatrice s smile and the mockery in her eyes brought him back to the present i remembered that i should have gone myself to see melvin to night he told her quietly it really was quite important i should have sought him instead of coming here indeed beatrice laughed brightly mr melvin seems to be in great demand are you and patricia to follow the french fashion of drawing the marriage contract and is mr melvin to act the part of a french notary there was a touch of irony in her question a little shaft of sarcasm that brought a quick flush to duncan s face he was reminded instantly of the tentative betrothal with patricia and his misgivings concerning it beside him was seated the one person who might aid them both and with sudden resolution acted upon as quickly as of miss brunswick s hands holding it between both his own beatrice he said with quiet emphasis you have always been a good fellow if ever there was a girl born in the world who was one i wonder if you could be persuaded to give me the benefit of your advice and possibly your active assistance she flushed a little under the praise and the intimately personal request that came with it but he did not notice this as he went on i ve somehow got things into the biggest kind of a muddle to day and i have a notion to tell you all about it i have the impulse to take you into my confidence and to ask you to help me out i know you can do it by jove beatrice i think you are the only person in the world who can do it will you she shrugged her shoulders ever so little and the flush left her cheeks suddenly came home to her that he was asking a favor that might prove extremely difficult to grant i can not say as to that until i hear what you wish me to do she replied i want you to help me square myself he said quickly to square yourself she raised her brows in assumed surprise with whom why with patricia of course help you to square yourself with patricia she laughed outright but without mirth i am afraid i do nt at all understand you roderick i supposed you had already accomplished that much for you told me did you not that patricia has just accepted you yes and that s the devil of it was the unexpected astounding reply beatrice moved farther away from him and took her hand from his grasp in well simulated horror of what he had said let us of polite society she said with mock severity we will leave the devil out of it if you please besides you

gone down on madam weatherstone s wrath and risen to find it unabated with condensed disapprobation written on every well cut feature she came to the coldly gleaming breakfast table that mrs halsey

unexpectedly appeared at breakfast perhaps in anticipation of a sort of roman holiday in which his usually late and apologetic stepmother would furnish the amusement they were both surprised to find her there before them looking uncommonly fresh in crisp sheer white with deep toned violets in her belt she ate with every appearance of enjoyment chatting amiably about the lovely morning efforts ill

all that parade yesterday the man or woman who attempts to get pleasure out of sitting in a finer seat or living in a finer house or wearing finer duds than his neighbor or even his enemy will miss it unless he is of a low order and taste when i saw all them good folks gaping and staring at me like i was a comet with a tail right there in the house of god while a good man was teaching humility and prayers and songs was going up to the throne i say while all that was taking place i felt like a cheat and a swindler hiding under plumes clap trap flowers and flounces that ud fade i looked across and saw carrie poor carrie with that blank stare of death in her eyes she seemed to say you ve whipped me clean to the earth dix i m done i m all how awful it is she may have thought i was crowing over her but i wasnt god knows i was nt during the first prayer i knelt down and prayed for her and begged forgiveness for my silly caper the poor thing has lost even her boy lover she s yearning for something she may never lay her hands on as god is my judge if i could give her this man that was here yesterday i d do it at the drop of a hat alfred i do nt want him nohow i thought i might come round to it but every word he says every move he makes goes against me if i tied myself to a man like that it would be one continual fight to approve of him oh he was so puffed up yesterday that i wanted to pull his ears and make him see straight talking all the time about the dash we d cut and the attention we attracted i was guilty of the crime and wanted to about well that is except one other thing one other thing henley echoed yes it was marry marry marry wife wife wife even before the home folks he could nt put a bite of my cooking in his big red mouth without saying what a blessing it would be to come to a table loaded that way three times a day i say i had to laugh there i was figuring on using him to the end that i could set back in a rocking chair and fan myself and tell a nigger cook to rake any old scraps together and not bother me with the details while he saw me with my sleeves rolled up humped over a hot stove or in a cloud of steam at a wash tub he said he could pay me the compliment of being the only girl who loved hard work as much as his mother had till it killed her loved it mind you think of drudging all your life for a man that favor by keeping it piled up around you while he was lying around a store telling a bunch of clerks what to do and wondering how long it would be before time to eat yes i felt mean all through the service and after he left little joe sneaked over after dark to get me to teach him his geography and while i was doing it i put my arm around his poor little wasted neck and hugged him he looked up and begun to cry and kissed me alfred there ai nt no mistaking the article when you run across it it is real love i have for that boy the love of a mother for her child that is suffering i went as far with him as the fence and as me and him stood together in the starlight i felt somehow that there was just one thing standing between me and god and that was the unworthy thing i had been doing that day i am thankful for my burdens for i have for joe shows what the other love ought to be like and until i yearn to help a man out of his troubles and cling to him and want him by me every minute until then i ll not sell myself you ca nt marry for pay and be honest for you know you ca nt give value for value you d have to act a part and that would be a living lie that would pall on you and sicken your very soul so you re not going to see long any more henley said carried out of himself by her winsome logic yes he s coming sunday i ll get through the day in some fashion or other but i m not going to tole im along like a pig following an ear of corn some girls would whether they intended to take him or not but i ve been through the rubs and ca nt afford to be so silly my natural pride wo nt for folks would say he turned me down and with all my good intentions i ca nt stand that i do nt know why but i ca nt i reckon we want what is ours if it is as empty as a bottle full of wind and in the fellow s way he does want me a girl can be an old maid with much more content if she s had what the world would call a solid chance when he had left her and was walking down the road henley paused and looked back and saw her making her way homeward through her cotton field i might have known she d kick him he said tenderly no man alive is worthy of her no man ever could be she s a jewel dropped from the skies she is as sweet and innocent as a baby and as strong and brave as a

love for love and given in love to rest and silence she was as one you have known as many whom others know now tell me is she not beautiful i saw standing before me the figure of the princess tall and slender and very beautiful and now the grave garments were not seen for her robe was of silk new and soft and shapely like to herself and her arms were round and soft and her eyes were full and dark and her hair was as deep shadows a band of gold was about her brow and her cheek was red and tender in its bloom her neck was white and round and her hands were white and her slender fingers curved slightly as her arms hung down by her sides her feet were small and straight and all all of her was beautiful and she was a princess illustration now as i gazed i saw the face and saw long so then i knew that the princess who was placed away for rest and silence had never died for did she not stand here before me and had i not long known her thus ah beautiful i took up these small golden shoes in my hands and held them out to her take these little shoes i said wrought as cunning as man may know place them upon thy feet for me and may never thorn assail thee in all thy going wear them and tread the steps of thrones years and years ages and ages princess beloved see they are wrought in love now i saw upon the lips of the princess who had lain down thousands of years ago but who lives in a place i know to day a smile very faint and far away so as the singing mouse told me it was to be seen that she did not die even as she faded away from the i wept that the princess was not dead and would not die she was beautiful she was beloved and these things have not died ah beautiful i said to the singing mouse but alas for a princess there should be a palace and here is none look about you said the singing mouse see for the time this is a palace i looked about me and it was as the singing mouse said for the time my room was a palace i saw standing there again the princess upon her feet small golden shoes what is this i asked and who am i but as i turned i saw that the singing mouse was gone but this i knew and so may you know that love does not die and here was proof of it illustration illustration of white moths illustration of white moths once said of a little stream grasses grew all about and small plants and flowers beyond the shores of the little stream arose a forest wide and dark into which the eye could reach but a little way as i stood near the little stream there arose from the grass and flowers two small moths soft and dainty beautiful and very white covered also with a white dust or powder which was so light that did they but receive a touch they must lose some of this soft white powder and so be injured so gentle and tender were they these two moths soft and white and silent arose in the air and circled one about the other rising for a time then falling but ever circling one about the other it seemed that perhaps they spoke one to the other but if that were true it was in speech so small that not even i could hear it they passed over the tops of the grasses and flowers the trees where they seemed very small i do not know why these moths no longer cared for the grasses and flowers but i saw them circling cross over the little stream high in the air and then pass on directly into the wide dark forest for a moment they appeared a small spot of white against the black shadows of the forest across the stream then they went on straight into the shadows until i could no longer see this small spot of white they made it is in this way said the singing mouse that human souls pass through life to me who can see them they look small and delicate and white and they circle one about another and they pass on into the deep forest illustration illustration the house of dreams illustration the house of dreams upon what couch i asked the singing mouse may one have the most noble dreams me with its bright eye and it seemed to me that the walls opened and widened i saw that i was within a great palace whose walls were hung in tapestries and whose doors were of golden panelings and whose windows were of curious crystals and whose furnishings were rich and wonderful and around whose stately limits swam wide gardens of strange flowers full of deep perfumes i heard soft voices of birds and the music also of gentle human voices singing and tenderly played instruments of silken and silvern strings it seemed to me that i lay upon a great couch of thrice piled down and touched hands with delights in all manners that one could think but alas i did not dream as i lay upon this couch then i saw these walls fade away in turn and in their stead arose a vast cathedral of the woods a music was in the trees and a solemn mountain stood as orator to the sky for me my couch was that of upon the grasses all about i touched hands with delights and so i dreamed and was very happy and content again the place changed and i lay in my own small room with naked walls

the day they got their skates suggestions to teachers of kit and kat they are twins and they live in holland kit is the boy and kat is the girl of course their real names are not kit and kat at all their real names are christopher and katrina but you can see for yourself that such long names as that would never in the world fit such a short pair of twins so the twins mother vrouw vedder said they can not be called christopher and katrina until they are four and a half feet high now it takes a long time to grow four and a half feet of boy and girl you know chickens and puppies and colts and kittens always grow up much faster than twins kit and kat ate a great many breakfasts and dinners and suppers and played a great many plays and had a great many happy days while they were growing up to their names i will tell you about some of them i the day they went fishing one door of her little dutch kitchen and stepped out she looked across the road which ran by the house across the canal on the other side across the level green fields that lay beyond clear to the blue rim of the world where the sky touches the earth the sky was very blue and the great round shining face of the sun was just peering over the tops of the trees as she looked out vrouw vedder listened the roosters in the barnyard were crowing the ducks in the canal were quacking and all the little birds in the fields were singing for joy vrouw vedder hummed a slow little tune of her own as she went back into her kitchen kit and kat were still asleep in their little cupboard bed she gave them each a kiss the twins opened their eyes and sat up o kit and kat said vrouw vedder the sun is up the birds are all awake and singing hurry you may go with him he is coming at six o clock so pop out of bed and get dressed i will put some lunch for you in the yellow basket and you may dig worms for bait in the garden only be sure not to step on the young cabbages that father planted kit and kat bounced out of bed in a minute their mother helped them put on their clothes and new wooden shoes then she gave them each a bowl of bread and milk for their breakfast they ate it sitting on the kitchen doorstep this is a picture of kit and kat digging worms you see they did just as their mother said and did not step on the young cabbages they sat on them instead but that was an accident kit dug the worms and kat put them into a basket with some earth in it to make them feel at home when grandfather came he brought a large fishing rod for himself and two hook on the end of each line vrouw vedder kissed kit and kat good bye mind grandfather and do nt fall into the water she said grandfather and the twins started off together down the long road beside the canal the house where the twins lived was right beside the canal their father was a gardener and his beautiful rows of cabbages and beets and onions stretched in long lines across the level fields by the roadside grandfather lived in a large town a little way beyond the farm where the twins lived he did not often have a holiday because he carried milk to the doors of the people in the town every morning early sometime i will tell you how he did it but i must not tell you now because if i do i ca nt tell you about their going fishing this morning grandfather carried his rod and the lunch basket kit and kat carried the basket of worms between them and their rods over their they walked along ever so far beside the canal then they turned to the left and walked along a path that ran from the canal across the green fields to what looked like a hill but it was nt a hill at all really because there are nt any hills in holland it was a long long wall of earth very high oh as high as a house or even higher and it had sloping sides there is such a wall of earth all around the country of holland where the twins live there has to be a wall because the sea is higher than the land if there were no walls to shut out the sea the whole country would be covered with water and if that were so then there would nt be any holland or any holland twins or any story so you see it was very lucky for the twins that the wall was there they called it a dyke grandfather and kit and they
his house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth the girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had thought her she had an eye to see and an ear to hear he could show her things and tell her things left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will it was during their night walks back to the farm that he felt most intensely the sweetness of this communion he had always been more sensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty his unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful persuasion but hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent ache veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it he did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege then he learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder that at his side living under his roof and eating his bread was a creature to whom he could say that s orion down yonder the big fellow to the right is aldebaran and the bunch of little ones like bees hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age and the long dim stretches of succeeding time the fact that admiration for his learning mingled with mattie s wonder at what he taught was not the least part of his pleasure and there were other sensations less definable but more exquisite which drew them together with a shock of silent joy the cold red of sunset behind winter hills the flight of cloud flocks over slopes of golden stubble or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow when she said to him once it looks just as if it was painted it seemed to ethan that the art of definition could go no farther and that words had at last been found to utter his secret soul as he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back with the poignancy of vanished things watching mattie whirl down the floor from hand to hand he wondered how he could to him who was never gay but in her presence her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference the face she lifted to her dancers was the same which when she saw him always looked like a window that has caught the sunset he even noticed two or three gestures which in his fatuity he had thought she kept for him a way of throwing her head back when she was amused as if to taste her laugh before she let it out and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her the sight made him unhappy and his unhappiness roused his latent fears his wife had never shown any jealousy of mattie but of late she had grumbled increasingly over the house work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl s inefficiency zeena had always been what starkfield called sickly and frome had to admit that if she were as ailing as she believed she needed the help of a stronger arm than night walks to the farm mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping and her training had done nothing to remedy the defect she was quick to learn but forgetful and dreamy and not disposed to take the matter seriously ethan had an idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant instinct would wake and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the county but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her at first she was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her but she laughed with him and that made them better friends he did his best to supplement her unskilled efforts getting up earlier than usual to light the kitchen fire carrying in the wood overnight and neglecting the mill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day he even crept down on saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor after the women had gone to bed and zeena one day had surprised him one of her queer looks of late there had been other signs of her disfavour as intangible but more disquieting one cold winter morning as he dressed in the dark his candle flickering in the draught of the ill fitting window he had heard her speak from the bed behind him the doctor do nt want i should be left without anybody to do for me she said in her flat whine he had supposed her to be asleep and the sound of her voice had startled him though she was given to abrupt explosions of speech after long intervals of secretive silence he turned and looked at her where she lay indistinctly outlined under the dark calico quilt her high boned face taking a grayish tinge from the whiteness of the pillow nobody to do for you he repeated if you say you ca nt afford a hired girl when mattie goes frome turned away again and taking up his razor stooped to catch the reflection of his why on earth should mattie go well when she gets married i mean his wife s drawl came from behind him oh she d never leave us as long as you needed her he returned scraping hard at his chin i would nt ever have it said that i stood in the way of a poor girl like mattie marrying a smart fellow like denis eady zeena answered in a tone of plaintive self effacement ethan glaring at his face in
raymond case had begun his recital adam adams began to show an interest if the man was strangled his throat should show the marks he observed there are no marks and the doctors have found no trace of poison humph the detective rubbed his chin reflectively what next margaret langmore was so horrified she ran from the the spot and a minute later two of the neighbors mrs bardon and her son alfred came over from next door where was mrs langmore at this time nobody knew alfred bardon is a physician and thinking there might still be a spark of life in mr langmore did all he possibly could to resuscitate the gentleman the servant girl ran upstairs to find some drugs for him and in the upper hallway stumbled over the dead body of mrs langmore and how had she died in the same manner as her husband this news of a double tragedy was too much for margaret and she fainted the others notified more of the neighbors and the police and of course the news spread like wildfire i was stopping at the beechwood hotel at the time and as soon as i heard of the tragedy i jumped into an automobile that was handy and rode over then you arrived at the house little before what did you see just what i have told you the doctor had been trying to bring mr langmore around but had suddenly been taken sick and could do nothing humph sick eh did he say what made him sick he did not know he thought it might be from leaning over the dead man or from working in that position i think the sudden sickness frightened him a little when the police arrived what did they find of importance nothing had anything been stolen nothing so far as they could learn of course you must have known these folks pretty well to take such an interest i knew mr langmore very well and i was acquainted with his wife adam adams knit his brow for a moment and tapped lightly on his desk with his forefinger have the police any idea as to how the he asked at this question raymond case s face flushed they do not think the murderer left the house he answered in a low tone chapter ii love under a shadow raymond case dropped back into his chair and buried his face in his hands adam adams eyed him curiously and with something of a fatherly glance it is plain to see what his trouble is thought the detective he is in love he was right raymond case was furiously desperately hopelessly in love he had met margaret langmore at bar harbor but a few short weeks before and it had been a case of love at first sight upon both sides a few automobile rides and a few dances and he had proposed and been accepted and he had counted himself the happiest man in all this wide world and now then they suspect the servant girl queried adam adams knowing they did nothing of the sort no ah yes it is is preposterous absurd but they insist and that is what has brought me to you i want to prove her innocence to the world do that and you can name your own price mr adams you have a high regard for the young lady you are close friends more i may as well tell you though so far margaret and i have kept the matter more or less a secret i love her and we are engaged to be married did mr langmore know of his daughter s engagement he did and he approved of it and what of mrs langmore did nt she approve she did not know of it margaret did not tell her why not because well the young lady and her stepmother did not get along very well together margaret wanted to be friendly but mrs langmore was very dictatorial and s let me ask was the daughter on good terms with her father yes excepting on one point he wished her to obey her stepmother and that she was not always willing to do this brought on a run of petty quarrels which fairly made margaret sick and this is the reason why the police think miss langmore the guilty person it is their theory is that she first quarrelled with her stepmother and murdered her and then struck down her father to cover her guilt he having discovered what she was doing how old is miss langmore she has just passed her twenty third birthday humph rather young to commit such a cold blooded crime as this she never did do it i ll wager my life on it oh it s absurd insulting but what are you going to do with a lot of pig headed country police how did they come to suspect her was mrs bardon the woman who lives next door is a great gossip and one who is continually poking her nose into other folks business she told the police that she was out in the garden cutting a bouquet early in the morning and she heard a violent quarrel going on at the breakfast table between mrs langmore and margaret and that mr langmore took his wife s part margaret wished to give a small house party and mrs langmore would not listen to it did mrs bardon hear all that was said no only enough to make her run to the police with the tale is any other house near by the harrison mansion but it is locked up as the family is in europe did you hear if mrs bardon and her son were home all morning they were excepting when the doctor went out to make some calls between nine and eleven did they see not a soul did mary billings the servant see anybody she
depths that s how i got the deal so prompt i told him i d undertake the job without any settlement till he got here to boss the doings but where did you get the money jude it s partnership joyce gaston broke in he set down his own emptied mug and drew a little farther from the fire s revealing light lauzoon filmer and gaston contractors and builders how does it sound but the money there was a little line of care now between the girl s deep eyes oh that s all gaston will get them back jude wiped his heavy lips on the back of his hand but it must have taken a good deal come joyce jude scowled you creep back to your corner when women get to tangling up money with their own doings it s the devil you keep to your business girl and leave deeper matters alone gaston frowned something lay back of that care traced line on joyce s forehead something lay back of her questioning what was it and jude s assumption of the male superiority over his young wife disturbed gaston he had not noticed it so sharply before presently joyce took the low stool and clasped her knees in her enfolding arms the two men had filled their pipes and now through the dim haze looked at the fair dreamy face between them then jude laid his pipe aside and snored the clock ticked softly the logs fell apart in a red glow in drawing nearer gaston and the pretty bent head came within easy distance of the hand lying inert on the chair arm jude gets awfully sleepy in the heat joyce whispered you do nt mind no why should i but i ought to be going you are tired too no the sudden upward glance was all a quiver with alertness i do nt ever seem tired now keeping one s own house is great and it seems like everything is waking up every minute sometimes i hate to go to sleep for fear i ll miss something and now gaston s hand touched the heavy curves of pale gold hair you have made a home he said i wonder if you know what a great achievement that is i wonder if jude knows joyce winced oh if he s a bit cross with me she whispered softly do nt you mind i understand i suppose you do gaston smoothed the silken hair but make him understand joyce it takes understanding on both sides you know and mr gaston the girl changed the subject as adroitly as a more worldly wise woman might have done you helped me make this home i ai nt ever going to let you forget that these pictures her loving glance took them all in and the books coming and going just fast enough to keep me nimble it seems like you d opened a gate and let some of the big world in there s plenty of it on the other side of the two solitudes joyce gaston s hand fell gently along the warm throat and rested on the bent shoulder jude gave another gurgling snore the two did not change their positions but there was silence for an instant that mountain top all jagged and high my how it just makes day long climb to getting somewhere out beyond and that great empty picture with the awful white wave coming from nowhere it just makes me hold my breath sometimes it seems as if it was going to swallow up everything and me it do nt ever do that does it mr gaston it has done damage of that kind in its time but generally it obeys orders and stops at the safety line gaston smiled into the wondering eyes i like the picture i like it terribly breathed the girl but i d hate the real thing i am sure it makes a terrific noise gaston nodded and old memories seemed beating in upon him it would wear me out by its own restlessness gaston s thought ran along with the cruder one its restlessness is at times unbearable unless one is very young and happy but i am young and happy joyce spoke lingeringly and her eyes grew fixed upon the it and be afraid of it it s beautiful but it s awful i do nt like awful things i like to look up at that brave old mountain and know it will always be the same no matter what happens down below suddenly gaston felt old very old beside this girl near him with her intuitive soul stretches and her hampered life so the mountain is your favourite picture joyce a grandfatherly tone crept into his voice and the caressing hand touched the round pale outline of cheek and chin with the assurance of age and superiority but the girl tingled under it no she said almost breathlessly i like that best of all and she pointed a trembling finger toward the madonna and child gaston was conscious of a palpitating meaning in the words and gesture why he asked softly because the fair head was lowered not in timidity but in deep thought because i want it my at the picture and i dream about it at night i know every little dimple and the soft curls and all i pray and pray and if god answers then a gentle ferocity rang through the hurried words i m going to keep it so it s going to be different from any other little child in st ange and it all fits in now that mr drew is coming back it s just wonderful it was mr drew that set me thinking about leaving something better for them as come after he said terrible strange things but you ca nt forget them can you i ve been well sort of weeding out my life ever
willing under the circumstances to take the risk first the cords which held the feet were severed then those which held the wooden gag in place then that which confined the hands when this last cord was cut two muscular arms flew up and seized the his nose was buried in the wet clothes of the man he had released let up he muttered in a smothered voice still the powerful arms drew him down and the boy was beginning to wonder if he had not better use his bolo when a voice whispered jimmie is it dead we both are we will soon be if you do nt let up answered jimmie jimmie from the bowery demanded the other sure was the reply what is this anyway a catch as catch can if you do nt let up i ll take a rib out with my bolo with a spring which almost keeled the boy over the figure sprang up ducked under the dripping canvas and crouched in the thicket from which jimmie had observed the tent jimmie s first thought was to follow then he thought of the remaining prisoners and turned to cut their bonds but he was too late as he and bent low for the purpose of entering to have hesitated longer would have been to invite capture and so with a sigh of regret the boy shot under the canvas and joined the other in the thicket it s leg bail for it came the familiar voice of pat mack and the boys poked their faces into the thicket and kept going regardless of the thorns and creepers which tore at their garments and tripped their feet it was so dark now that they could not see a hand held two inches from their eyes but they kept on making as little noise as possible chapter vii a missing motor boat you rapscallion pat mack whispered as the two came together in the embrace of a particularly tough creeper how did you ever get here i saw you last on the good old bowery i did nt fly over replied jimmie here he added take this mean by chokin me when i cut you loose a hug of affection retorted the other you looked like an angel to me did you flutter down from the sky in the rain i ought to give you a good punch for it jimmie replied you near took the hide off me beautiful nose have you got that bloomin steel cable cut seems to me they are comin after us the boys stood perfectly still and listened above the patter of the rain above the murmur of the trees above the chattering of the aroused monkeys came the crash of heavy bodies through the bushes the sound of human voices sure they are whispered pat and they set off again working their way painfully through the jungle falling now and then over long vines coming into contact with great trees and swinging parasites which brushed against their faces like snakes the boys pressed on as came closer the pursuers were more familiar with jungle methods than they and no pretense of secrecy was made have you got a gun whispered jimmie i have nt even got a toothpick was the reply we ll have to fight before long jimmie said panting with the exertion of the unfamiliar struggle with the jungle there s plenty of hollow trees about suggested pat why not hide in one of them until they pass the suggestion seemed a good one for a moment then the uselessness of such an effort at concealment became apparent with sinking hearts the boys heard the low whine of a hound i wonder how they managed to track us so easily jimmie said give me the bolo pat said i ll split the dog s head open if he comes near us use your gun on the men the boys did not give up hope of however the acclivity they were ascending grew steeper as they advanced and they were obliged to stop now and then to rest on one of these occasions they heard a commotion in the jungle just ahead of them this was disheartening they ve flanked us whispered pat the pursuers were carrying a torch which in the rain gave a dim light but still served to direct their steps and the glow of the flame now reached to the very spot where the lads stood the bushes behind them parted and the glowing eyes of the hound looked up in their faces then the call of the beast told the men following that he had at last sighted his prey the boys turned to flee again but came up against an almost perpendicular wall of rock the pursuers saw them now and came on with cries of victory guess they ve got us pat said not yet jimmie answered but however courageous the lads been taken in a moment had they not received unexpected assistance the hound was almost at their feet when a shot was heard and the great beast fell to the ground struggled for an instant and lay still another shot followed the first instantly and the torch dropped from the uplifted hand of the evil faced man who was carrying it in the lead an intense uncanny darkness followed the extinction of the torch and the two boys took advantage of it to edge around the face of the rock which had blocked their progress without the help of the dog and without the torch the pursuers could do little and stood on equal terms with the pursued it was impossible of course for the boys to make their way through the jungle without making any noise and in a moment the pursuing party showed its temper by firing revengeful shots at the spots from which the sounds of their progress proceeded after half a dozen bullets had

i found that the bite i took off of each piece i had had in hand satisfied me as nothing i had ever eaten in all my life before had done while at the same time my nibbles soothed his conscience about robbing me his teeth are big and strong and white and his jaws work like machinery he is the strongest man i ever saw and his gauntness is all muscle what is that glow a woman gets from feeding a hungry man whom she likes with her own hands and why should i want to be certain that he kissed the lace on my sleeve as it brushed his face when i reached across him to catch an inquisitive rose that i saw peeping in the window at us leaf fifth blue absinthe the juice of a lemon in two glasses of cold water to be drunk immediately on wakening page eleven i ve handed myself that lemon every morning now until i am sensitive with myself about it if there was ever anybody on the water wagon it s i and i have to sit in the gallon of water i m supposed to consume in that time sometime i m going to get mixed up and try to drink my bath if i do nt look out i dreamed night before last that i was taking a bath in a glass of ice cream soda water and trying to hide from doctor john behind the dab of ice cream that seemed inadequate for food or protection i have nt had even one glass for two months and i woke up in a cold perspiration of embarrassment and raging hunger i do nt know what i m going to do about this book and i ve got myself into trouble about writing things besides records in it he looked at me this morning as coolly as if i was just anybody and said i would like to see that record now mrs molly it seems to me you are about as slim as you want to be how did you tip the scales last time you weighed and have you noticed any trouble at all with your heart and i ve got to melt and freeze and starve off that four i answered ignoring the heart question and also the question of producing this book wonder what he would do if i gave it to him to read just as it is how about the heart he persisted and i may have imagined the smile in his eyes for his mouth was purely professional anyway i lowered my lashes down on to my cheeks and answered experimentally sometimes it hurts then a cyclone happened to me come here to me a minute he said quickly and he turned me around and put his head down between my shoulders and held me so tight against his ear that i could hardly breathe expand your chest three times and breathe as deep as you can he ordered from against my back buttons i expanded and breathed pretty quickly at that illustration breathe as deep as you can now hold your breath as long fitted my mood exactly to do so ca nt find anything he said at last letting me go and looking carefully at my face his eyes were all anxiety and i liked it when does it hurt you and how he asked anxiously moonlight nights and lonesomely i answered before i could stop myself and what happened then was worse than any cyclone he got white for a minute and just looked at me as if i was a bug stuck on a pin then gave a short little laugh and turned to the table i did nt understand you were joking he said quietly that maddened me and i would have done anything to make him think i was not the foolish thing he evidently had classified me as being i snatched at my mind and shook out a mixture of truth and lies that fooled even myself and gave them to him looking straight in his face i would have cracked all the i m not joking i said jerkily i am lonesome and worse than being lonesome i m scared i ought to have stayed just the quiet relict of mr carter and gone on to church meetings with aunt adeline and let myself be fat and respectable but i have nt got the character you thought i went to town to buy a monument and i did nt i bought enough clothes for two brides and now i m scared to wear em and i do nt know what you ll think when you see my bank book everybody is talking about me and that dinner party tuesday night and aunt adeline says she ca nt live in a house of mourning so desecrated any longer she s going back to the cottage aunt bettie pollard says that if i want to get married i ought to do it to mr wilson graves because of the seven children and then everybody would be so relieved that they are taken care of that they would forget that mrs johnson says i ought to be declared a minor and put as a ward to you i ca nt help judge wade s sending me flowers and tom s sitting on my front steps night and day i m not strong enough to carry him away and murder him i am perfectly miserable and i m now that ll do molly just hush for a half minute and let me talk to you said doctor john as he took my hand in his and drew me near him no wonder your heart hurts if it has got all that load of trouble on it and well just get a little of that scare off you put yourself in my hands and you are to do
glad to receive the comfort of finding one s brother disinclined to take what saint gregory calls a sublime tone would tend illogically i own to ease the burden of anxiety even the remote reader sick of discouraging details experiences a renewal of confidence and all because father feron s good humour is of the common kind which we can best understand and with which it befits every one of us to meet the vicissitudes of life i have said that the ardent reformer is seldom gay small wonder when his eyes are turned upon the dark places of earth and his whole strength is consumed in combat yet saint teresa the most redoubtable reformer of her quality of her gladness she was not only spiritually serene she was humanly gay and this in the face of acute ill health and many profound discouragements we have the evidence of all her contemporaries friends nuns patrons and confessors and we have the far more enduring testimony of her letters in proof of this mirthfulness of spirit which won its way into hearts and lightened the austerities of her rule a very cheerful and gentle disposition an excellent temper and absolutely void of melancholy wrote ribera so merry that when she laughed every one laughed with her but very grave when she was serious there is a strain of humour a delicate and somewhat biting wit in the correspondence of saint teresa and in her admonitions to her nuns there is also an inspired common sense which we hardly expect to find in the writings of a religious and a mystic but teresa was not withdrawn from the world she travelled establishing new foundations visiting her convents and dealing with all classes of men from the soldier to the priest from the prince to the peasant the severity of her discipline was tempered by a tolerant and half amused insight into the pardonable foibles of humanity she held back her nuns with one hand from the frenzy of self mortification which is the mainstay of spiritual vanity and with the other hand from a too solicitous regard for their own comfort and convenience they were not to consider that the fear of a headache a non existent headache threatening the future was sufficient excuse for absenting themselves from choir and if they were too ailing to practise any other austerities the rule of silence she reminded them could do the feeblest no harm do not contend wordily over matters of no consequence was her counsel of perfection fly a thousand leagues from such observations as you see i was right or they did me an injustice long as teresa ruled practical and fearless save when a lizard ran up her sleeve on which occasion she confesses she nearly died of fright her much sought advice was always on the side of reason asceticism she prized dirt she abhorred for the love of heaven she wrote to the provincial gratian then occupied with his first foundation of discalced friars let your fraternity be careful that they have clean beds and tablecloths even though it be more expensive for it is a terrible thing not to be cleanly no persuasion could induce her to retain a novice whom she believed to be unfitted for her rule we women are not so easy to know was her scornful reply to the jesuit olea who held his judgment in such matters to be infallible but nevertheless her practical soul yearned over a well dowered nun when an excellent novice with a fortune of six thousand ducats presented herself at the gates in avila was consumed with anxiety lest such an acquisition should through some blunder be lost for the love of god wrote the wise old saint to the prioress in seville if she enters bear with a few defects for well does she deserve it this is not the type of anecdote which looms large in the volumes of minced saints prepared for pious readers and its absence has accustomed us to dissever humour from sanctity but a candid soul is as a rule a humorous soul awake to the tragi comic aspect of life and immaculately free from self deception and to such souls cast like teresa s in heroic mould comes the perception of great moral truths together with the sturdy strength which supports enthusiasm in the face of human disabilities they are the lantern bearers of every age of every race of every creed les ames bien nees whom it behooves us to approach fearlessly out of the darkness for so which fiddle strings is weakness to expredge my nerves this night mrs gamp anna robeson burr in her scholarly analysis of the world s great autobiographies has found occasion to compare the sufferings of the american woman under the average conditions of life with the endurance of the woman who three hundred years ago confronted dire vicissitudes with something closely akin to insensibility to day says mrs burr a child s illness an over gay season the loss of an investment a family jar these are accepted as sufficient cause for over strained nerves and temporary retirement to a sanitarium then war rapine fire sword prolonged and mortal peril were considered as furnishing no excuse to men or women for altering the habits or slackening the energies of their daily existence as a matter of fact isabella d este witnessed the sacking of rome without so much as thinking of nervous prostration this was nearly four hundred years ago but it through such days and nights of horror and emerge therefrom with unimpaired vitality and unquenched love for a beautiful and dangerous world is to rob the words shock and strain of all dignity and meaning to resume at once the interrupted duties and pleasures of life was for the marchioness of mantua obligatory but none the less we marvel that she could play her role so well a hundred and
the rich notes of the woman s voice swelling into the midnight air then i gathered the rope in my arms and sought the sleeping quarters of my grandfather the old tiger of the pathans as i knew well was prepared to be aroused at any hour of the night even his tulwar was buckled to his belt when in answer to my summons he stepped forth into the outer chamber he listened to my eager shaggy eyebrows but not even the twitching of a muscle in his face betrayed surprise at the close of my narrative he laid a kindly hand on my shoulder o son of my dead son he said gravely if what you have seen to night be not a dream then have you done me great service but go now and sleep and prepare yourself for what is to come rest assured more than ever before that allah is on our side and that even as i said to you last night our enemies are being delivered into the hollow of our hands but sleep still refused to come to me that night the call for morning prayer found me wide awake turning over in my mind the many perplexities of the situation had the quarrel in the camp of our adversaries been nothing but a cunning pretence the fight among the tribesmen before the dawn a mere sham even the gathering in of the supposed all contrived so that this devil of devils mustafa khan should gain access to the citadel with skilled sappers and mining munitions and was the youth who had played the part of a goatherd really a son of the man or a serpent tongued liar a chosen master of craft whose seeming guilelessness had helped to delude us it had been a crude first idea on his part to suggest the admission as refugees of a swarm of armed men but when this had failed there had been glib readiness with the other and more subtle plan that had so nearly succeeded and as i reflected on these things i marked the young hypocrite for my own particular prey during the morning hours i was surprised to see the two khans guest and host betrayer and betrayed walking around the gardens in seeming amity but after a time my grandsire beckoned me to his side this is a grandson of mine he said presenting me to mustafa khan approaching too close to your present quarters and that any explosion would endanger the members of your household i saw the traitor pale under the quiet eye of the tiger of the pathans there will be no explosion to day he stammered you seem to be fully and precisely acquainted with the plans of our enemies nay do not draw that sword by your side mustafa khan look behind you man with haggard face now mustafa turned round it was to see half a dozen pikes pointed at his ribs at a signal from their master a guard had noiselessly drawn near you know what to do jemadar said the old tiger to the officer in charge there was a vicious smile now on his face such as i had never seen there before and never saw again a savage curling of the upper lip that showed the white fangs of the relentless hunting animal and prodded by the proudly erect be it said for a pathan always knows how to die with dignity and resignation to the will of god nor must we forget that he was a brave man for in coming to the citadel he had boldly ventured his life on a desperate chance and perfidy in the game of war brings shame only when it meets with discomfiture peace be with his soul my grandsire and i were now alone you will let me fight that crawling snake his son i cried with a gesture of appeal he is already carrion for the vultures was the reply he was no son of mustafa khan just a low born hireling schemer and it needed only a prod of the dagger to make him betray the whole plot and whine for the mercy which i would have scorned myself to bestow the two skilled sappers are still mining under my directions this time we shall make a feint of a sally to morrow morning outside but it is the sabat and its occupants that will be blown into the sky and not my good stout walls this last with the old familiar smile stern but pleasant to look upon and the girl who sang i ventured falteringly she is safe in the protection of my home on her rests no blame for in the part she played she was but obeying her father s bidding now that is all for the present keep your own counsel and be with me to morrow at the dawn and with the dawn came the swarm of mustafa khan s clansmen running eagerly toward the opened gateway of the fort with their fellow conspirators shouting and shooting and waving their swords in pretended pursuit but just within the entrance were ranged a dozen guns and arquebuses on swivels loaded to their muzzles with slugs of iron and almost at the same moment as the rain of death mowed down the onrushing horde fragments of a hundred bodies blown from the sabat by our countermine filled the air then indeed did our men at arms footmen and horsemen sally forth to pursue with sword and spear their scattered and dismayed enemies sending scores to their deaths and the survivors scampering to their dens among the mountains and none ever again dared to attack my grandsire the tiger of the pathans with a proud smile the afghan surveyed his audience no one ventured to question him yet there was a look of unsatisfied curiosity on more than one face oh yes laughed the soldier lightly
we jogged on yes i had to say this looked serious the fire might not be coming smoke certainly was worse the air certainly was warmer the breeze was changing or else we were down into another breeze next i saw a black shaggy creature lumbering past before and i pointed without stopping they nodded bear panted ward i nodded the bear was getting out of the way too will we make it again asked ward sure i answered we had to on we plowed we were almost at the bottom of the slope and we ought to be reaching those willows and aspens the brush was not so bad now but the brush does not figure much in a forest fire when the flames leap from tree top to tree top and make a crown fire that is the worst of all this was hot enough to be a crown fire if a breeze helped it we saw lots of animals rabbits and squirrels and porcupines and more deer and the birds were calling and fluttering thick with it and with the smell of burning pine and how we sweat then hurrah we were into the aspens i tell you their white trunks and their green leaves looked good to me but ahead of us was that other slope to climb before we were into the bareness shall we go on asked scout van sant he coughed we all coughed as we wheezed that had been a hard hike the air was hot we could feel the fire as the wind came in strong puffs everywhere animals were running and flying and the aspens were full of wild things panicky we had to decide quickly for the fire was much closer are you good for another pull i asked they grinned out of streaming faces and white lips we ll make it if you can but i did nt believe that we could up i went into an aspen to reconnoiter i called down they dropped their packs and scurried chapter xii foiling the fire i do nt know what a record i made in climbing that tree an aspen s bark is slick but in a jiffy i was at the top and could peer out note all the sky was smoke veiling the upper end of the valley and of the ridge the ridge must be afire the fire was spreading along our side and if we tried for the opposite slope and the bare spot we might be caught halfway something whisked through the trees under me it was a coyote and as i slid down like lightning thinking hard as to what we must do and do at once i heard a calling and van sant and ward came rushing back we ve found a place they cried huskily a boggy place with willows let s get in it we grabbed the packs i carried one at last scout ward led clustering thick that was a good sign the ground grew wet and soft and slushed about our feet i tell you it felt fine will it do gasped scout ward back great i said it s occupied but i guess we can squeeze in added van sant and sure enough animals had got here first all kinds coyotes rabbits squirrels skunks porcupines a big gray wolf and a brown bear and one or two things whose names i did nt know but we did nt care we forced right in to the very middle nothing paid much attention to us except to step aside and give us room of course the coyotes snarled and so did the wolf but the bear simply lay panting he was so fat and we lay panting too we were nt any too soon the air was gusty hot and gusty coolish and the smoke the water would collect and so that we could dash it over each other if necessary i could reach with my hand and pet a rabbit but i did nt nothing bothered anything else even the coyotes and the wolf let the rabbits alone this was a sanctuary there was a tremendous crashing and a big doe elk bolted into the midst of us she was thin and quivery and her tongue was hanging out and her eyes staring but she did nt stay with another great bound she was off outrunning the fire she probably knew where she was going we others lay around flat waiting wish we were on her back gasped van sant we re all right i said think so sure i answered they were game those red fox scouts they never whimpered we had done the best we could and after you ve done the best you can there take it without kicking as for me i was full of thought i never had been in a forest fire before but it seemed to me our chances were good only i wondered about general ashley and fitzpatrick in the hands of that careless gang and about major henry and jed smith and kit carson and about the beaver man with the wounded leg he d have the hardest time of all now the smoke was so heavy and sharp that we coughed and choked the air was scorching we could hear a great crackling and snapping and the breeze withered the leaves about us we burrowed the animals around us cringed and burrowed the fire was upon us and a forest fire in the evergreen country is terrible there was a constant dull roar our willows swayed and writhed the rabbit crept right against me and lay shivering and the coyotes whimpered i flattened myself and so did the red fox scouts and with my face in roaring was steady and the crackling and snapping was worse than any fourth of july sparks came whisking down through the willows and sizzled in the wetness one lit on a coyote
he slipped it into one of the pockets of his big reefer they walked in silence for a few minutes until they had passed the end of the village and then hank put his hand on the boy s arm you ve got a right hunch he said abruptly in a low voice there s somethin in the wind what makes you think so asked colin the other pointed vaguely to sea there s a ship out there he said colin did his utmost to pierce the gloom but the fog had settled down again the night was dark and the boy could scarcely see the waves breaking on the shore not twenty feet away i ca nt see anything he said whereabouts i do nt know just where the old sailor replied but i know let s hurry said the boy better go slower warned hank pulling him back gently we re not far from the rookery i do nt see why we should be so careful and i do nt see why we should whisper colin objected whispering nevertheless the seals are making noise enough to drown a brass band listen said hank the boy put his hand to his ear trying to distinguish sounds in the continuous roar voices he queried with a puzzled look i thought so the whaler nodded there was a pause while both listened then the gunner said it is nt english and it does nt sound like aleut or russian japanese queried the boy at a guess the man grasped the boy s shoulder with a grip that nearly dislocated it japanese raiders he said can you run excited i m a crack runner get back to the agent s house as fast as you know how an wake him up he ll know what to do what are you after hank asked the boy tightening his belt whatever comes along was the terse reply colin pitched off his heavy coat and started it was over a half mile run but the boy was in good condition and the path was smooth so that two minutes saw him at the agent s bedroom door eh what s that japanese raiders you ve been dreaming boy go back to bed do i look as if i d been dreaming colin said indignantly how do you suppose i could run myself out of breath in a dream hank was with me he heard them too and sent me back to tell you but the agent was already up and busy without waiting to find out how this should be done colin started off at a run and picking up a killing club that lay handy he sped down the village street hitting a resounding whack on every door as he passed as he came back up the other side of the street the natives were streaming out of their houses and colin told them all to go to the agent whereupon those who understood english started immediately the rest following the agent was ready and had all his plans made some of the men were sent to the boats and arms for others were laid out they were right on gorbatch rookery the agent asked yes sir colin replied at the reef point end the party was swinging along at a fast half run over the sands that lay between the edge of the village and the beginning of the rookery and with the rising of the moon the fog seemed to thin before it gets too light the agent said but we d better make the best use we can of our time on reaching the wall the agent vaulted lightly over it the rest following suit and to colin s surprise the official led the way behind the rookery threading in and out between idle bulls who made a display of great ferocity but never actually attacked the agent paid not the slightest heed to any of them merely keeping out of reach of their teeth as they turned a corner a cloud which had partly obscured the moon passed and showed them an unexpected sight magnified into gigantic forms by the fog were the figures of six men apparently all armed facing hank the old whaler who with both revolvers was keeping them at bay he was close to the shore standing behind two old wicked looking beachmasters who in the unnatural light appeared to be twice their natural size hank let out coming to his assistance but he did not relax his vigilance i ve got this bunch covered he said an they ca nt get to their boat one load did get off hearing his shout the invaders turned quickly but found themselves overpowered for a dozen rifles were leveled at them they knew too that natives who are trained to shoot fur seal in the water as most of those men had done before pelagic sealing was stopped could be counted on as good shots the agent who spoke sufficient japanese for simple needs demanded the surrender of the raiders and asked which was the officer of the party this question they refused to understand i suppose he went off in the other boat hazarded the agent that s a pity he stands a good chance of being shot colin looked up inquiringly how do you expect to catch him now he asked the fog is clearing away a lot the boy admitted illustration a typical seal rookery half abandoned showing the massing of the harems the watchful figures of the beach masters and the idle bulls in the background courtesy of the u s bureau of fisheries row boat has nt much chance against a launch has it oh i see now colin said understandingly you covered the water with another party in a very swift gasoline launch we have while you were waking the village i got a wireless to a revenue cutter i caught her
when the others were busy with their horses his only reply was a low hiss commanding silence a quarter past the hour found them on their way the ponies picking their path gingerly over the bad ground until they reached the range here the three rustlers drew up short for in the distance could be seen the twinkling of a camp fire one of the bar t punchers said joe but i reckon he wo they walked their horses and then urged them to a trot in the direction of the river whose tree lined banks they had seen late in the afternoon they paused only once in this place and then to cross a small stream that lay in their path as he rode larkin worked his arms cautiously back and forth until he felt the rotten rawhide give and knew that a single violent motion would free him entirely but he refrained from making that motion feeling certain that the man in the mask would give the signal when the time was ripe at last they discerned the loom of the trees against the low northern sky and pulled their horses to a walk until they arrived directly underneath a big cottonwood which stood in sinister readiness here s your last chance said parker in a low voice if you swear as we have told you you can go free now we take a man s word out here never replied larkin shore not rejoined the other we always grant a man s last request come on boys let s finish this thing quick he had hardly spoken when from the distance came the sound of rapid revolver firing mingled with the wild shouts of men for a few moments the drama beneath the cottonwood came to an abrupt halt by gum cried joe the bar t punchers have found the boys and there s the devil to pay back there lively now one of the others took his lariat from the throng at the side of his saddle and heaved the coil over an outstretched limb of the cottonwood he had hardly done so when another sound reached them a low menacing rumble that grew momentarily louder until it reached a dull roar a stampede bawled one of the men and it s heading this way joe and the man in the mask still on their horses led pinte former reached down to take the noose of the rope from the one who had arranged it suddenly larkin felt a hand fumbling with the rawhide about his arms and a low voice in his ear whispered now with the same motion bud wrenched his hands free and dug his spurs into the sides of his horse pinte startled leaped forward just as larkin drew the revolver from his pocket joe though caught by surprise did not let go of the bridle that was wound about his right hand but a blinding shot from the gun of the man in the mask did the work with a groan parker pitched forward out of his saddle and fell to the ground just as larkin fired pointblank at the third man who appeared before him still on foot the fellow went down but not until a yellow stab of light flashed up from where he had been and bud felt the wind of a bullet as it sped past his cheek the fourth man was and the man he had rescued were now alone but their thoughts were fully occupied the sound of the distant stampede had become a veritable rumbling roar that told of its nearing proximity aside from this drumming of many feet there was no sound for the animals of the range when in the grip of panic are silent with glazed eyes and muscles strained to the utmost they thundered into the dark unconscious and heedless of the sure destruction in their path it was as though thousands of creatures with their brains removed had been turned loose to run at will to the river cried the masked man suddenly panic stricken spurring his horse in the direction of the stream but larkin was at his heels and in a moment had seized the other s bridle and thrown the horse back on his haunches no bawled he at the top of his voice the bank here is twenty feet high and at the bottom are rocks death in the stampede yelled the stranger but bud would not yield and drew the horse back we can divide the herd he cried come we have nt a moment to lose they wheeled as one and dashed out of the brush into the open of the range the earth was now trembling beneath them and the pounding feet sounded a low steady note ominous with warning occasionally there was a revolver shot but this was the only other sound straight toward the oncoming living avalanche the two men rode until they had left an open space a hundred yards wide behind them then they pulled up short and dismounted now out of the threatening thunder sounded a single individual note the rapid beating of a horse s feet some horse that was bearing a desperate rider ahead of the stampede but powerless to avoid it instantly larkin saw the picture of the yawning precipice toward which the frantic rider was hurrying at breakneck speed he raised was instantly acted on for in another moment a lathering heaving pony dashed up to them and the rider leaped to the ground oh what shall i do hello who are you cried a female voice and larkin s heart leaped as though it had turned over in its place juliet he cried seizing the girl with one arm and drawing her close bud for an instant she clung to him lead the horses together and shoot them he ordered although the others could scarcely hear him every instant was priceless now
to be even gently sarcastic after the exalted revelation he had made of himself thank you she said quietly and turned her face and smiled at the now steel blue reaches of the river he dropped in several evenings to see her when he was in an idealistic mood she was warmly responsive when he and raillery and at such times she was as elusive as baffling as exasperating as a sprite on occasions when he rather insistently asked her plans and her progress in her father s case she evaded him and held him at bay she felt that he admired her but with a grudging unwilling admiration that left his fundamental disapproval of her quite unshaken the more she saw of this dogmatic dreamer this erratic man of action the more she liked him the more she found really admirable in him but mixed with her admiration was an alert and pugnacious fear so big was he so powerful so violently hostile to all the principles involved in her belief that the whole wide world of action should in justice lie as much open to woman to choose from as to man without cessation katherine kept eyes and mind on blake she searched out and pondered over the thousand possible details and ramifications his conspiracy might have no human plan was a perfect plan chance that she might discover one detail one slip one oversight that would give her the key to the case one of the thousand possibilities was that he had an active partner in his scheme since no such partner was visible in the open it was likely that his associate was a man with whom blake wished to have seemingly no relations were this conjecture true then naturally he would meet this confederate in secret she began to think upon all possible means and places of holding secret conferences such a meeting might be held there in westville in the dead of night it might be held in any large city in which individuals might lose themselves indianapolis louisville cincinnati chicago it might be held at any appointed spot within the radius of an automobile journey katherine analyzed every possible place of this last possibility she began to watch as she watched other possibilities the comings and goings of the blake automobile it occurred to her that if anything at night and then a little later it occurred to her to make a certain regular observation the blake garage and the west stable stood side by side and opened into the same alley every evening while blake s car was being cleaned if it had been in use during the day katherine went out to say good night to her saddle horse and as she was on friendly terms with blake s man she contrived while exchanging a word with him to read the mileage record of the speedometer this observation she carried on with no higher hope of anything resulting from it than from any of a score of other measures it was merely one detail of her all embracing vigilance every night she sat on watch the evening s earlier half usually in the rustic summer house in the backyard the latter part at her bedroom window one night after most of westville was in bed her long patient vigil was rewarded by seeing the blake automobile slip out with a single streets of the town hours passed and still she sat wide eyed at her window it was not till raucous old muzzains of roosters raised from the watch towers of their various coops their concatenated prophecy of the dawn that she saw the machine return with its single passenger the next morning as soon as she saw blake s man stirring about his work she slipped out to her stable watching her chance she got a glimpse of blake s speedometer then she quickly slipped back to her room and sat there in excited thought the evening before the mileage had read this morning the reading was blake in his furtive midnight journey had travelled twenty two miles if he had slipped forth to meet a secret ally then evidently their place of meeting was half of twenty two miles distant where was this rendezvous almost instantly she thought of the sycamores that fitted the requirements exactly it was eleven miles distant blake had a cabin there the place was be safer than for two men coming in different vehicles from different points perhaps to meet at that retired spot at such an eyeless hour perhaps there was no confederate perhaps blake s night trip was not to a secret conference perhaps the sycamores was not the rendezvous but there was a chance that all three of these conjectures were correct and if so there was a chance aye more a probability that there would be further midnight trysts bruce had fallen into the habit of dropping in occasionally for a few minutes at the end of an evening s speaking to tell katherine how matters seemed to be progressing when he called that night toward ten he was surprised to be directed around to the summer house his surprise was all the more because the three months drought had that afternoon been broken and the rain was now driving down in gusts and there was a far rumbling of thunder that threatened a nearer and a fiercer cannonading crouching beneath his the summer house in which he saw sitting a dim solitary figure in mercy s name what are you doing out here he demanded as he entered watching the rain i love to be out in a storm every clap of thunder sent a shiver through her you must go right into the house he commanded you ll get wet i ll bet you re soaked already oh no i have a raincoat on she answered calmly i m going to stay and watch the storm a little
had quarreled three years before of this money trouble from which colonel fairfax had shielded her she must as yet know nothing and there was no turkey for the christmas dinner verily things looked dark for the ill fated job roosting in unsuspecting security in the desolate old barn with bowed head the darky walked slowly toward the door uncle noah the colonel s tones were incisive you will kill job tonight i mos forgot massa dick faltered uncle noah dat supper s ready sah ol missus done come downstairs jus foh i chases job to roost laws a massy massa dick ca nt he live till after supper the colonel nodded carefully avoiding the old man s troubled eyes and went to join his wife at supper christmas eve my dear he announced cheerfully as he bent to kiss the sweet wistful face that for keeping you waiting uncle noah and i were discussing to morrow s turkey he gazed calmly at the old negro nervously handling the tea things he has selected a large bird and i have been advising a smaller the colonel opened his napkin and deftly tucked the hole in the end out of sight beneath the table now uncle noah what is there to night for supper to uncle noah this nightly question had become a sacred institution a stimulus to imaginative powers highly developed in his quaint dialogues with the colonel he forgot the doomed job it was christmas eve and his creative gift took festive wings well sah he beamed we has a little chicken gumbo some fried chicken jus the right golden brown sah creamed potatoes hot biscuits with currant jelly er sliced ham and baked potatoes colonel fairfax thoughtfully considered the appetizing prospect in accordance with the rules of the game what mattered it that the luscious edibles the little pretense gave to each a delightful thrill surely an adequate extenuation of the harmless diversion as usual colonel fairfax found the key to the situation in the closing items of uncle noah s list it all sounds delicious uncle noah he observed graciously but i have a touch of my old enemy the dyspepsia today i think i shall have sliced ham and baked potatoes that i think will do for us both mrs fairfax agreed her kindly eyes fixed upon uncle noah s attentive face and sah uncle noah began it was christmas eve and this game must be perfectly played shall i attend to de distribution of gifts in de negroes quarters sah yes agreed the colonel see that no one is slighted mrs fairfax bowed her wistful face upon her hands to hide the blinding tears and an odd uncomfortable silence fell upon the little group at length the colonel pushed his he said sternly a suspicious brightness gleaming in his eyes that turkey of yours is making a terrible noise under the window make him quit gobbling patricia i do nt wonder he makes you nervous he s an old renegade that the object of the colonel s wrath had long since retired to roost mattered not to his accuser the turkey had developed a convenient habit of gobbling under the window whenever emotion forced the colonel to seek a vent in stern commands uncle noah crossed to the window and commanded job to be silent mrs fairfax southern gentlewoman and thoroughbred from tip to toe quivered proudly and as uncle noah returned bade him serve the supper in tones as well controlled as they were gentle ii the inspiration ii in the great barren kitchen uncle noah wiped his steel rimmed spectacles and glared angrily about him ol missus grievin her heart out foh young massa dick he reflected and de colonel say slight no worl a comin to ebery time ol mis cry for young massa dick colonel say job gobbles the old darky choked miserably at the thought of the destined check to job s gobbling career and replacing his spectacles carefully carried in the supper prolonging its simple service to the uttermost with the single idea of adding precious minutes to the doomed turkey s span of life when at length he sought the barn it was quite dark and the velvet stillness of the night was dotted thickly with snowflakes with trembling fingers he opened the great barn door lit a queer old lantern hanging just within and hung it high upon a projecting hook the dim light revealed an antique carriage house in one corner of which upon a rude improvised roost of shingles the tyrant job slept the sleep of the just and the unjust rolled into one as the lights flickered upon his ruffled feathers the turkey emitted a throaty grunt of disapproval and moved cumbrously around to avoid the light see yere massa job he said tai nt no use yoh puttin on yoh high and mighty airs to night i se come to interview yoh sah understand job majestically tucked his head beneath his wing as if to intimate his indifference to the proposed interview uncle noah surveyed his ruffled back

indignity withdrew his head from the sheltering wing and pecked at the brown fingers turning around with a stately movement and facing the light once more with a sleepy blink of his bright beadlike eyes now sah we can talk exclaimed the negro in delight drawing up an old box he seated himself before the roost and beamed benevolently over his glasses colonel done he began confidentially when ol mis cry bout young massa dick de colonel he jus got ta scold bout sumthin and as yoh is de mos important person about he jus naturally selects yoh the turkey held his head upon one side apparently
i ll break you for this cassidy he declared fiercely why did nt you get here on the run when you heard the shot but there was nt any shot the perplexed and alarmed detective expostulated he fairly stuttered in the earnestness of his self defense i tell you chief there has nt been a sound burke rose to his feet his heavy face was set in its sternest mold you could drive a hearse through the hole they ve made in him he rumbled he wheeled on mary and dick so he shouted now it s murder well hand it over where s the gun followed a moment s pause then the inspector spoke harshly to cassidy he still felt himself somewhat dazed by this extraordinary event but he was able to cope with the order search him before the detective could obey the direction dick took the revolver from his pocket where he had bestowed it and held it out and it so chanced that at this incriminating crisis for the son the father hastily strode within the library he had been aroused by the inspector s shouting and was evidently greatly perturbed his usual dignified air was marred by a patent alarm what s all this he exclaimed as he halted and stared doubtfully on the scene before him burke in a moment like this was no respecter of persons for all his judicious attentions on other occasions to those whose influence might serve him well for benefits received you can see for yourself he said grimly to the dumfounded magnate then he fixed sinister eyes on the son so he went on with somber menace in his voice you did it young man he nodded toward the em both down town that s all the command aroused dick to remonstrance against such indignity toward the woman whom he loved not her he cried imploringly you do nt want her inspector this is all wrong now at last mary interposed with a new spirit she had regained in some measure at least her poise she was speaking again with that mental clarity which was distinctive in her dick she advised quietly but with underlying urgency in her gently spoken words do nt talk please burke laughed harshly what do you expect he inquired truculently as a matter of fact the thing s simple enough young man either you killed griggs or she did the inspector with his charge made a careless gesture toward the corpse of the murdered stool pigeon for the first time edward gilder as his glance unconsciously followed the officer of flesh and bone that had once been a man he fairly reeled at the gruesome spectacle then fumbled with an outstretched hand as he moved stumblingly until he laid hold on a chair into which he sank helplessly it suddenly smote upon his consciousness that he felt very old and broken he marveled dully over the sensation it was wholly new to him then soon from a long way off he heard the strident voice of the inspector remorselessly continuing in the vile the impossible accusation and that grotesque accusation was hurled against his only son the boy whom he so loved the thing was monstrous a thing incredible this whole seeming was no more than a chimera of the night a phantom of bad dreams with no truth under it yet the stern voice of the official came with a strange semblance of reality either you killed him the voice repeated gratingly or she did well then young man no dick shouted aghast then it was you such was the inspector s summary of the case mary s words came frantically once again she was become desperate over the course of events in this night of fearful happenings no no he did nt burke s rasping voice reiterated the accusation with a certain complacency in the inevitability of the dilemma one of you killed griggs which one of you did it he scowled at dick did she kill him again the husband s cry came with the fierceness of despair over the fate of the woman i told you no the inspector always savagely impressive now in voice and look and gesture faced the girl with saturnine persistence well then he blustered did he kill him the nod of his head was toward dick then as she remained silent i m talking to him the reply came with a soft distinctness that was like a crash of destiny yes dick turned to his wife in reproachful amazement mary he cried incredulously this betrayal was something inconceivable from her since he believed that now at last he knew her heart burke however as usual paid no heed to the niceties of sentiment they had small place in his concerns as an official of police his sole ambition just now was to fix the crime definitely on the perpetrator you ll swear he killed him he asked briskly well content with this concrete result of the entanglement mary subtly evaded the question while seeming to give unqualified assent why not she responded listlessly at this intolerable assertion as he deemed it edward gilder was reanimated he sat rigidly erect in his chair in that frightful moment it came to him anew that here was in verity the last detail himself god he cried despairingly and that s your vengeance mary heard and understood there came an inscrutable smile on her curving lips but there was no satisfaction in that smile as of one who realized the fruition of long cherished schemes of retribution instead there was only an infinite sadness while she spoke very gently i do nt want vengeance now she said but they ll try my boy for murder the magnate remonstrated distraught oh no they ca nt came the rejoinder and now once again there was a hint of the quizzical creeping in the smile no they ca nt she repeated
of such contemplative exercise as the very considerable distance for small legs between those regions and the westward fourteenth street might comprise pedestrian gaping having been in childhood as i have noted prevailingly my line fate appeared to have kindly provided for it on no small scale to the extent even that it must have been really my sole and single form of enclosed union square would seem to point a little among us all to nobler types of motion but of any basis for recreation anything in the nature of a playground or a breathing space the institution itself was serenely innocent this i take again for a note extraordinarily mediaeval it occupied the first and second floors if i rightly remember of a wide front that overhanging the endless thoroughfare looked out on bouncing clattering stages and painfully dragged carts and the promiscuous human shuffle the violence of repercussions from the new york pavement of those years to be further taken into account and i win it back from every side as in spite of these aspects of garish publicity a dark and dreadful and withal quite absurd scene i see places of that general time even places of confinement in a dusty golden light that special memories of small misery scarce in the least bedim and this holds true of our next and quite neighbouring refuge the a sordidly black interior is my main image for it attenuated only by its having very soon afterwards as a suffered ordeal altogether lapsed and intermitted faintly in the gloom i distinguish m vergnes himself quite old very old indeed as i supposed him and highly irritated and markedly bristling though of nothing in particular that happened to me at his or at anyone s else hands have i the scantest remembrance what really most happened no doubt was that my brother and i should both come away with a mind prepared for a perfect assimilation of alphonse daudet s chronicle of jack years and years later on to make the acquaintance in that work of the petits pays chauds among whom jack learnt the first lessons of life was to see the institution vergnes at once revive swarming as it did with small homesick cubans and mexicans the complete failure of blondness that marks the memory is doubtless the cumulative effect of so many of the new black and conducing to a greasy gloom into this gloom i fear i should see all things recede together but for a certain salient note the fact that the whole staff appears to have been constantly in a rage from which naturally resulted the accent of shrillness the only accent we could pick up though we were supposed to be learning for the extreme importance of it quantities of french and the sound of high vociferation i remember infuriated ushers of foreign speech and flushed complexion the tearing across of hapless exercises and dictees and the hurtle through the air of dodged volumes only never despite this the extremity of smiting there can have been at the institution no blows instructionally dealt nor even from our hours of ease do any such echoes come back to me little cubans and mexicans i make out were not to be vulgarly whacked in deference presumably to some latent relic or imputed survival of castilian pride which for reflection and comparison might well have been so suggested interesting at least the element of contrast between such opposed conceptions of tone temper and manner as the passion without whacks or with whacks only of inanimate objects ruling the scene i have described and the whacks without passion the grim impersonal strictly penal applications of the rod which then generally represented what was still involved in our english tradition it was the two theories of sensibility of personal dignity that so diverged but with such other divergences now on top of those that the old comparison falls away we to day go unwhacked altogether though from a pride other than castilian it is difficult to say at least what ideal has thus triumphed in the vergnes air at any rate i seem myself to have sat unscathed and unterrified not alarmed even by so much as a call to the blackboard only protected by my insignificance which yet covered such a sense of our dusky squalor queer for us the the poor petits pays chauds who had come so far for their privilege we had come comparatively but from round the corner and that left the state of education and the range of selection all about as quaint enough what could these things then have been in the various native climes of the petits pays chauds it was by some strong wave of reaction clearly that we were floated next into the quieter haven of mr richard pulling jenks where cleaner waters as i feel their coolness still must have filled a neater though it was true slightly more contracted trough yet the range of selection had been even on this higher plane none too strikingly exemplified our jumping had scant compass we still grubbed with a good conscience in broadway and sidled about fourth street but i think of the higher education as having there from various causes none the less begun to glimmer for us a diffused brightness a kind of high crosslight of conflicting windows realm of mr pulling jenks and bathes it as with positively sweet limitations limited must it have been i feel with our couple of middling rooms front and back our close packing our large unaccommodating stove our grey and gritty oilcloth and again our importunate broadway from the aggregation of which elements there distils itself without my being able to account for it a certain perversity of romance i speak indeed here for myself in particular and keen for romance must i have been in such conditions i admit since the sense of it had crept into a recreational
maurice levy s constitution lo sam said maurice cautiously what you doin penrod at that instant had a singular experience an intellectual shock like a flash of fire in the brain sitting in darkness a great light flooded him with wild brilliance he gasped what you doin repeated mr levy penrod sprang to his feet seized the licorice bottle shook it with stoppering thumb and took a long drink with histrionic unction what you doin asked maurice for the third time sam williams not having decided upon a reply it was penrod who answered drinkin lickrish water he said simply and wiped his mouth with such delicious enjoyment that sam s jaded thirst was instantly stimulated he took the bottle eagerly from penrod a a h exclaimed penrod smacking his lips eyes above the fence glistened ask him if he do nt want some penrod whispered urgently quit drinkin it it s no good any more ask him what for demanded the practical sam go on and ask him whispered penrod fiercely say m rice sam called waving the bottle want some bring it here mr levy requested come on over and get some returned sam being prompted i ca nt penrod schofield s after me no i m not said penrod reassuringly i wo nt touch you m rice i made up with you yesterday afternoon do nt you remember you re all right with me m rice maurice looked undecided but penrod had the delectable bottle again and tilting it above his lips affected to let the cool liquid purl enrichingly into him while with maurice s mouth watered here cried sam stirred again by the superb manifestations of his friend gim me that penrod brought the bottle down surprisingly full after so much gusto but withheld it from sam and the two scuffled for its possession nothing in the world could have so worked upon the desire of the yearning observer beyond the fence honest penrod you ai nt goin to touch me if i come in your yard he called honest cross my heart answered penrod holding the bottle away from sam and we ll let you drink all you want maurice hastily climbed the fence and while he was thus occupied mr samuel williams received a great enlightenment with startling rapidity penrod standing just outside the storeroom door extended his arm within the room deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the drug store seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine is like that great simple broad strokes dazzled mr samuel williams leaned against the wall he had the sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a chef d oeuvre perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost universal one on such huge occasions why could nt i have done that sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of the new talleyrand sam had no partner for the cotillon if maurice was to be absent from that festivity as it began to seem he might be penrod needed a male friend to take care of miss rennsdale and he believed he saw his way to compel mr williams to be that male friend for this he relied largely upon the prospective conduct of miss rennsdale when he should get the matter before her he was inclined to believe she would favour the exchange as for talleyrand penrod himself he was going to dance that cotillon can drink at one pull m rice said penrod kindly you said i could have all i want protested maurice reaching for the bottle no i did nt returned penrod quickly holding it away from the eager hand he did too did nt he sam sam could not reply his eyes fixed upon the bottle protruded strangely you heard him did nt you sam well if i did say it i did nt mean it said penrod hastily quoting from one of the authorities looky here m rice he continued assuming a more placative and reasoning tone that would nt be fair to us i guess we want some of our own lickrish water do nt we the bottle ai nt much over two thirds full anyway what i meant was you can have all you can drink at one pull how do you can gulp all you want so long as you keep swallering but you ca nt take the bottle out of your mouth and commence again soon s you quit swallering it s sam s turn no you can have next penrod said sam well anyway i mean m rice has to give the bottle up the minute he stops swallering craft appeared upon the face of maurice like a poster pasted on a wall i can drink so long i do nt stop swallering yes that s it all right he cried gim me the bottle and penrod placed it in his hand you promise to let me drink until i quit swallering maurice insisted yes said both boys together with that maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to drink penrod and sam leaned forward in breathless excitement they had feared maurice might smell past this was the crucial moment their fondest hope was that he would make his first swallow a voracious one it was impossible to imagine a second they expected one big gulping swallow and then an explosion with fountain effects little they knew the mettle of their man maurice swallowed once he swallowed twice and thrice and he continued to swallow no adam s apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat but the internal progress of the liquid was not a whit the less visible his eyes gleamed with cunning and malicious triumph sidewise at the stunned conspirators he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught not once breaking the thread of that marvelous swallering his
gentlemen hum and he never once spoke of his discomfort on the long hot road though a hay camp is subject to most singular mishaps i i have often of charming humor a superlative grain of humor perhaps and he s very lazy and fine and frank and honorable one may not forget arcadia and the rake of twigs one may not forget that is very true but he seeks to make himself out such a very great fool he cloaks each generous instinct with a laughing drollery why did you hum when you cooked his supper and called to him through the trees i i do not know t was the world old instinct of primitive woman no no no it was only because i was living the life i love the best i was very happy why were you happier after the storm i i do not know you have scolded with flashing eyes about the hay camp but i i did not mind i tried to mind and could not that is a very singular thing yes tall sentinel you have furtively watched of moonlit nights among the trees a sentinel who slept by day upon a ridiculous bed of hay that he might smoke and watch over the camp of his lady until peep o day i do not know you are sighing even now for the van and a camp fire for the hay camp through the trees no with a very definite flash of perversity where is this persistent young nomad of the hay camp anyway i i have wondered myself but with a quiver of impatience the horse had pawed the ground and the tiny bird flew off to a distant clump of palmetto diane rode hurriedly off into the flat woods chapter xxviii the nomad of the fire wheel it had been an unforgettable day this day in the pine woods diane had forded shallow streams and followed bright winged birds lunched by a silver lake set coolly in the darkling shade of cypress and found a curious nest in the stump of a tree now her saddle she was riding slowly back through the pine woods though the sun which awhile back had filled the hollow of palmetto fronds with a ruddy pool of light had long since dropped behind the horizon the girl somehow picked the homeward trail with the unerring instinct of a wild thing that one may be hopelessly lost in the deceptive flatwoods she dismissed with a laugh the wood is kind to wild things it was quite dark when through the trees ahead she caught the curious glimmer of a cart wheel of flame upon the ground hub and spokes glowing vividly in the center of a clearing curiously the girl rode toward it unaware that the picturesque fire wheel ahead was the typical camp fire of the southern indian or that the strange wild figure squatting gravely by the fire in lonely silhouette against the white of a canvas covered wagon beyond in the trees was a vagrant seminole from the proud old turbaned tribe who still dwell in the inaccessible morasses of the everglades the realization came in florida indian harmed no one he still considered himself proudly hostile to the white man wherefore diane wisely wheeled her horse about to retreat it was too late already the young seminole was upon his feet keen of vision and hearing for all he seemed but a tense still statue in the wildwood accepting the situation with good grace diane rode fearlessly toward his fire and reined in her horse but the ready word of greeting froze upon her lips for the nomad of the fire wheel was a girl tall and slender barbarically arrayed in the holiday garb of a seminole chief the firelight danced upon the beaten band of silver about her brilliant turban and the beads upon her sash upon red beaded deerskin leggings delicately thonged from the supple waist to the small and moccasined foot upon a tunic elaborately banded in red and a belt of buckskin from which hung a hunting knife a revolver and an ammunition pouch but diane s fascinated gaze lingered longest upon the indian girl s face of the sun dark caucasian than of the red man and lovelier than either with grave vigilant eyes of dusk a straight small nose and firm proud mouth vividly scarlet like the wild flame in her cheeks aloof impassive the indian girl stared back i wish well to the beautiful daughter of white men she said at length with native dignity the contralto of her voice was full and rich and very musical her english deliberate and clear cut immensely relieved for the keen glance of those dark indian eyes had suddenly softened diane leaped impetuously from her horse across the fire white girl and indian maid clasped hands illustration white girl and indian maid then clasped hands do forgive me she exclaimed warmly but i saw your fire and turned this way before i really knew what i was doing just as diane won the confidence of every wild thing in the forest so now with her winsome grace and unaffected warmth she won the forest leaped like a spark from eye to eye then with a slow grave smile in which there was much less reserve the seminole motioned her guest to a seat by the fire nothing loath diane promptly tethered her horse and squatted indian fashion by the cartwheel fire immensely thrilled and diverted by her picturesque adventure my name she offered presently with her ready smile is diane di ane said the indian girl majestically and added naively she was the roman goddess of light and of hunting is it not so diane looked very blank where in the world she stammered staring and colored the indian girl smiled from so high she said shyly i have been taught by mic co like the white

cowardice of the american soldiers and saw them wager the dewey would not come to manila at all but that he would sail down around the malay peninsula and hasten home by way of good hope to save his vessels from certain destruction all this sounded plausible to her and she grew restless and enthusiastic as the dull hours dragged away dewey was so long in coming from hongkong and the garrison on the island had been kept at their guns ready for action for so many hours without rest that many of them were completely tired out by the last day of april and asked for relief it was hard to give it marie s opportunity had come her ability as an expert rifle shot was known alike to officers and enlisted men she offered to serve the spanish commandant could not well refuse he needed her services besides power to win the temporary friendship of the natives consequently he promised to assign her to duty for the night the sunset as viewed from corregidor island on the evening of april was most glorious not a cloud was in the sky a dead calm prevailed so that the sea was unusually smooth as the sun sank to rest behind the shimmering horizon it caused the island to cast a long shadow over manila bay as far as the eye could reach but this soon disappeared when the sun had sunk from view marie noticed that a comparatively new moon was visible in the sky and she remarked to the sergeant of the guard it will not be very dark to night we can see the americanos a long way off yes replied the sergeant the only difficulty with the cowards is that they will not come near enough to be seen at all they have had plenty of time to run from hongkong to manila and heard of i ll bet you a peso spanish dollar that they have gone home and that all of this excitement has been for nothing dewey is getting old marie he does nt want to go to a watery grave so far from home if he were young and ambitious it would be different old men do not care much about real fighting especially on the sea it is different with old generals commanding land forces they can sit away back in the rear of the battle field receive messages that come to them plan certain movements based upon these reports and while they do have considerable responsibility still they are not in the actual fight as for dewey nobody has ever heard of him he is not a recognized naval commander besides the old fellow according to reports is slow and easy going if he should come to make us an unfriendly call tonight mark my word marie there will not be a sliver inside of thirty minutes after the first shot is fired he had scarcely concluded speaking when the officer of the guard lieutenant orlando called out sergeant of the guard fall in the first relief the sergeant threw his arm over marie s shoulder in an affectionate manner smacked a hurried caress against her olive cheek jumped up from the little bamboo bench on which they were sitting rushed up to the guard house and cried out first relief fall in marie hastened after him as the relief was forming in line she seized a mauser rifle that stood leaning against a huge rock grabbed up a cartridge belt well filled with mauser ammunition that was lying on the ground near by hastily adjusted it to fit her waist measure buckled it on and fell into the rear rank count fours ordered the sergeant as is usual in military affairs the front and rear rank men count in unison that is number rear rank both count one at the same time second file counts two etc when it came to marie she piped out simultaneously with the corporal who stood in front of her quatro four as the guard was marched along the stony pathways on corregidor island and the various sentinels were relieved marie soon saw that there was not going to be a place for her she tip toed up to the corporal who was posting the relief and asked him where he was going to station her never mind said the corporal we have a place for you and sure enough they had every soldier or civilian who has ever been on this island will readily recall the rough hard beaten winding path that led from the summit of the hill in a south westerly direction down over precipices around clumps of bamboo to a beautiful fresh water spring which bubbled out of the coral rocks at a point just high enough the season of high tides a few feet from this spring and elevated but slightly above it is a massive flat rock along the north and west sides of this rock is a vertical stone precipice some eight feet high which from its upper edge inclines back gradually at an angle of about twenty degrees above a horizontal plane toward the crest of the island on this rock spain firmly bolted one of her most modern cannon a good seven inch gun it was so situated on a revolving casement that its shots could be made to sweep the whole boca grande channel as the large entrance south of the island is called marie had often operated this gun she had done splendid work with it on a floating target two miles distant its deadly roar was her delight oh if she could but use it just once on an actual enemy instead of firing it at an indicated one when the old guard had been relieved and the sentries were marched back to the guard house marched along just as they approached the guard house the sergeant motioned to her to fall out
drove hard with his right he knew that he gauged the distance carefully and he was unable to account for the fact that the blow failed to land a moment later he staggered back a trifle from a blow upon the side of the cheek davis had outgeneraled him there there was not much force to the blow and frank smiled now davis advanced and feinting rapidly with both hands placed his right against frank s mouth but the lad had perceived the blow coming and stepped quickly backward breaking the force of it and was not hurt before davis could cover the lad placed a hard right and left to davis nose up this advantage quickly and followed his man around the room striking out whenever opportunity offered plainly davis was becoming rattled he continued to retreat now frank backed him into a corner and drove a hard uppercut to the chin davis head jerked backward and struck the hard wood of the wall frank stepped back and allowed davis to come out of the corner davis it could be plainly seen was furiously angry but he held himself in check apparently realizing that victory depended upon coolness and caution frank advanced swiftly swung and missed by a fraction of an inch as davis jerked his head sharply to one side before the lad could recover davis struck out viciously and landed flush on frank s jaw the lad staggered back but before davis could follow up his advantage frank covered and held his opponent off the blow had been the hardest of the fight so far davis with more confidence since this blow stepped forward aggressively feinted right to frank s sore jaw again frank covered up and gave ground believing that he had the lad at his mercy davis advanced quickly and swung hard with his left with dazzling rapidity frank stepped inside and catching the swing with his left arm planted his right fist squarely upon davis nose davis uttered a cry of pain and leaped back frank followed pressing him closely davis seemed content to remain on the defensive now and for the space of perhaps a minute warded off all the lad s blows with a really remarkable defense even jack was forced to give him his due he can box he muttered but i doubt if he can keep his head but the end of the battle came now with sudden and unexpected swiftness frank seeking to put an end to the fight stepped forward feinted with his left and drove his right straight for davis chin swinging from the floor davis jerked before he could recover davis had swung hard with both hands and both blows went home one catching frank in the abdomen doubling him up and the other straightening him again as it landed squarely on his chin frank dropped to the floor and lay still chapter xviii mistaken for an enemy davis had won fairly and cleanly there was no doubt about that but jack and lord hastings wasted no time in considering the merits of the encounter each sprang forward and bent above the lad lord hastings raised the boy s head to his knee water he said to jack the latter hastened to get it and after a few drops had been sprinkled over his face frank opened his eyes he glanced up curiously at lord hastings what s the matter he asked what s happened matter is returned jack quietly that you have just been convinced that you are not such a terrible fighter as you have been demanded frank suddenly realizing just what had happened he did returned jack dryly and he did a pretty good job of it but i tell you i had him cried frank one more blow and and the one more blow did nt land replied his chum but i tried yes you tried all right i saw you you just missed him and then he landed on you twice and hard that s why you re here he could nt do it again said frank feebly maybe not and maybe yes said jack however you re not going to have another trial you ve been licked and licked good and proper and that s all there is to it see if you can get up now i ll take you to our own quarters frank pulled himself to his feet and leaning on jack his coat and stood near as the two passed out there was a sneering smile on his puffed face and he spoke perhaps you fellows will pay a little more attention to me when i say something after this he muttered jack whirled on him sharply see here he said quietly if you make any trouble in the future i ll take you in hand myself you ll find that the result will be somewhat different so sneered davis feeling not a little proud of himself you are at liberty to try at any time right now eh he made as if to discard his coat flushed with victory he manifested no doubt that he could handle jack as well as frank in spite of himself jack was forced to smile we wo nt fight now he said quietly you re not in condition in the first place but when you have been fixed trifle with me threats eh call them what you please i do nt want to have to spank you but i may have to do nt bother me that s all he helped frank from the room without another word lord hastings about to leave the room stopped for a word with davis just a word of advice he said as you know we are on a perilous duty any more trouble and i ll have you ironed if necessary you re in no position to make a nuisance of yourself davis made no reply he recognized lord hastings authority to
lanky unprepossessing man with a truculent eye rimmed by lashless lids and with a drooping mustache which almost concealed the cruel curve of his lips whom he knew as denver ed having met him several times in the durango country and a medium sized stranger whom he knew as garvey the latter was dark complexioned with a hook nose and a loose lipped mouth calumet did not appear to notice them he poured his glass full and lifted it preparatory to drinking before it reached his men garvey had left them and was standing beside him have that on me said garvey silkily to calumet calumet surveyed him with a glance of mild interest he set his glass down and the other silently motioned to the bartender for another stranger here i reckon said garvey as he poured his whiskey where s your ranch the lazy y said calumet the other filled his glass here s how he said and tilted it toward his lips calumet did likewise if he felt the man s hand on the butt of the six shooter at his hip he gave no indication of it nor did he seem to exhibit any surprise or concern when after drinking and setting the glass down he looked around to see that garvey had drawn the weapon out and was examining it with apparently casual interest this action on the part of garvey was unethical and dangerous and there were men calumet or to one another whispered the significant words greenhorn and tenderfoot others to whom the proprietor had spoken concerning calumet looked at him in surprise still others merely stared at garvey and calumet unable to account for the latter s mild submission to this unallowed liberty the proprietor alone remembering a certain gleam in calumet s eyes on a former occasion looked at him now and saw deep in his eyes a slumbering counterpart to it and discreetly retired to the far end of the bar where there was a whiskey barrel in front of him but calumet seemed unconcerned some gun remarked garvey it was strange though that he was not looking at the weapon at all or he might have seen the empty chambers he was looking at calumet and it was apparent that his interest in the weapon was negative yes some agreed calumet he swung around and faced the man leaning his denver ed sauntered over and joined them he looked once at calumet and then his gaze went to garvey as he spoke friend of yourn he questioned there was marked deference in the manner of garvey he politely backed away shifting his position so that denver ed faced calumet at a distance of several feet with no obstruction between them calumet s eyes met denver s and he answered the latter s question garvey having apparently withdrawn from the conversation friend of his sneered calumet grinning shallowly i reckon not i m pickin my company denver ed did not answer at once he moved a little toward calumet and shoved his right hip forward so that the butt of his six shooter was invitingly near then with his hands folded peacefully over his chest he spoke you do he said you mangy there was a stir among the onlookers as the vile epithet was his fingers closed around the butt of the weapon at denver ed s hip the gun came out with a jerk and lay in calumet s hand calumet began to pull the trigger the dull metallic impact of the hammer against empty chambers was the only result denver ed grinned malignantly as his right hand stole into his vest there was a flash of metal as he drew the concealed gun but before its muzzle could be trained on calumet the latter pressed the empty weapon in his own hand against the one that denver ed was attempting to draw blocking its egress while in calumet s left hand the six shooter which he had concealed under his own vest roared spitefully within a foot of denver ed s chest many in the room saw the expression of surprise in denver ed s eye as he pitched forward in a heap at calumet s feet there were others who saw garvey raise the six shooter which he had drawn from calumet s holster all heard the hammer click impotently on the and cover garvey saw the flame spurt and watched garvey crumple and sink there was a dead silence taggart had not moved calumet s gaze went from the two fallen men and rested on his father s enemy did nt work he jeered they missed connections did nt they you ll get yours if you ai nt out of town by sundown layin for me for a week eh you sufferin sneak thinkin i was born yesterday he ignored taggart and looked coolly around at his audience not a man of which had moved he saw the sheriff standing near the door and it was to him that he spoke frame up he said in short sharp accents back durango way denver an the little guy pulled it off regular little man gets your gun denver gets you riled sticks his hip out so s you ll grab his gun you do gun s empty try to perforate denver then he pulls another gun an salivates you self defense he looked around with a cold grin planted an empty on him myself he said the little guy fell for it so did denver i reckon that s all you wantin me for this he inquired of the sheriff you ll find me at the lazy y taggart he hesitated and looked around taggart was nowhere to be seen sloped added calumet with a laugh i do nt reckon i ll want you said toban clear case of self defense i reckon most everybody saw the play some raw several men had moved one of
pistol but his fingers went to his belt and with the quickness of light itself he hurled a knife straight at marteau the woman his aim her movement was purely instinctive according to his own words she had even more to fear from marteau than from this ruffian the young officer instantly dropped to his knees and as he did so presented his pistol and fired the knife whistled harmlessly over his head and buried itself in the wood paneling of the door the bullet sped straight to its mark the unfortunate blackguard collapsed on the floor at the feet of the girl who screamed and shrank back shuddering now mademoiselle said the young man advancing into the room i have the happiness to inform you that you are free chapter vii a rescue and a siege the woman stared at him in wild amazement that she was free temporarily at least could not be gainsaid her captors had not seen fit to bind her and she now stood absolutely untouched by anyone the shooting the fighting had confused her she had only seen marteau as an accomplice and friend of change of heart she did not know whether she had merely exchanged masters or what had happened smiling ironically at her bewilderment which he somehow resented in his heart marteau proceeded to further explanation you are free mademoiselle he repeated emphatically bowing before her but i thought did you think that i could be allied with such cowardly thieves and vagabonds as those but you said it was simply a ruse could you imagine that one of my family that i should fail in respect and devotion to one of yours to you i determined to free you the instant i saw you and will you not complete your good work broke out the man tied to the chair in harsh and foreign but sufficiently comprehensible french by straightway releasing me young sir but who is this this is sir gervaise yeovil answered mademoiselle laure my attorney an came with me from chatillon to get certain papers and why all this bother and explanation burst out sir gervaise tell him to cut these lashes and release me from this cursed bondage he added in english that is quite another matter sir said marteau gravely i regret that you are an enemy and that i can not but we are not enemies monsieur cried one of the officers who had just succeeded in working a gag out of his mouth we are russian officers of the imperial guard and since you have deserted the cause of the corsican you will deserted thundered marteau his pale face flaming that was as much a ruse as the other what then do you mean by wearing a russian coat over your uniform and he is a spy he shall be hanged said the other also freeing himself of his gag gentlemen ask me to release you in order that you may hang me i wo nt hang you burst out the englishman on the contrary i ll give you fifty pounds if you ll cut these cords and marteau shook his head countess bellowed yeovil angrily there s a knife on the table yonder pray do you the young woman made a swift step in that direction but the frenchman was too quick for her pardon me mademoiselle i beg that the first use you make of your new life be not to aid my enemies your enemies marteau the enemies of france then not my uncle s france said the girl but your father s and i had hoped yours no no in any event these gentlemen must remain bound for the time being no harm shall come to you from me but as for these hounds he stepped over to the two cossacks who lay mute he bent over them with such a look of rage ruthless determination and evil purpose in his face as startled the woman into action monsieur she cried stepping over to him and striving to interpose between him and the two men marteau what would you do my sister dead in the cottage yonder after after he choked out he stopped his fingers twitching my old father if i served them right i would pitch them into yonder fireplace or torture them the dogs the cowards my friend said the young countess gently laying her hand on his arm marteau threw up his hands that touch recalled him to his senses i will let them alone for the present he said meanwhile he seized the dead man and dragged the body out of sight behind the tables will monsieur from the dim recesses of a far corner and who are you asked marteau lifting the light and staring a frenchman sir they knocked me on the head and left me for dead but if monsieur would assist me i marteau stepped over to him bent down and lifted him up he was a stout hardy looking peasant boy pale cheeked with blood clotted around his forehead from a blow that he had received feverish fire sparkled in his eyes if monsieur wishes help to put these brutes out of the way command me he said passionately we will do nothing with them at present answered marteau quick laure the knife whispered the englishman the frenchman heard him however and wheeled around mademoiselle he cried on your honor i charge you not to abuse the liberty i have secured for you and that i allow you but friends you would even now be he paused as my sister he added with terrific intensity your pleasure shall be mine said the young woman if i could have a drink of wine said the young peasant sinking down into a chair there is a flask which they did not get in the pocket of one of the officers yonder said the young frenchwoman looking sympathetically at the poor exhausted

vi the triumph vii the downfall viii the chain is locked jimsy the christmas kid illustration i the invasion his name was jimsy and he took it for granted that you liked him that made things difficult from the very start that and the fact that he arrived in the village two days before christmas strung to such a holiday pitch of expectation that if you were a respectable bewhiskered first citizen like jimsy s host you felt the cut and dried dignity of a season which unflinching thrift had threatened by his bubbling air of faith in something wonderful to happen he had arrived at twilight just as the first citizen was about to read his evening paper and he had made a great deal of noise yelling back at old austin white whose sleigh had conveyed him from the station to the house a s long uncle pregnant with the friendliness of a conversational ride he had scraped away his snow heels with a somewhat sustained noise born perhaps of shyness and now as he stood in the center of the prim old fashioned room a thin eager youngster not too warmly clad for the bite of the new england wind abner sawyer felt with a sense of shock that this city urchin whom judith had promised to christmas detracted in some ridiculous manner from the respectability of the room he was an inharmonious note in its staid preciseness moreover it was evident from the frank friendliness of his dark gray eyes that he was first citizen aura of informality and give and accept friendship as a matter of course illustration what what is your name asked the first citizen peering over his spectacles he wished that judith s christmas protege was not so thin and a trifle larger illustration jimsy answered the boy an specks he s me chum he goes to mister middleton s next door specks and jimsy the first citizen helplessly cleared his throat and summoned judith she came in a spotless apron no whiter than her hair she was spare aunt judith sawyer spare and patient as the wife of a provident man may well be who sees no need for servants and her primness was of a gentler vaguer sort than that of abner sawyer jimsy glanced up into her sweet tired face and his eager eyes claimed her with a bewildering smile of welcome then because jimsy s experience with clean aprons and trimly parted hair was negligible almost to the should polish the toe of one worn shoe with the sole of the other and study the result and aunt judith with furtive interest judith said the first citizen not wholly at his ease mr er ah mr jimsy has arrived jimsy snickered naw naw nix he said jimsy s the handle i m a stray i am hai nt got no folks mom dorgan says ye have to have folks to have a bunch name i m the christmas kid to be sure you are said aunt judith gently to be sure and where are your things jimsy s thin little face reddened hai nt only got one rig he mumbled an that war nt fitten to wear mom dorgan borried these duds fur me she she s awful good that way when she s sober there was wistful eagerness in his face to illustration quite unconscious of the scandalized flutter in this quiet room whose oval portraits of ancestral sawyers might well have tumbled down at the notion of any one being anything but sober the boy moved closer to the fire as if the ride had chilled him illustration gee he said with a long quivering breath ai nt that a fire now ai nt it and because his keen young eyes could not somehow be evaded abner sawyer accepted the responsibility of the reply and said hastily that it was then feeling his dignity imperilled in the presence of judith though why he could not for the life of him explain he moved forward a chair for the christmas guest and returned to his paper aunt judith went back to a region of tinkling china and humming kettle the room became quiet enough for any one to read but the first citizen somehow could not read he was ridiculously conscious of that tense little figure by the fire with the disturbingly noisy who was absolutely quiet yet his very presence seemed to clamor the clamor of an inherent sociability repressed with difficulty jimsy glanced at the checkerboard window beyond which snowy hills lay beneath a sunset afterglow gee whiz he burst forth ai nt the snow white the first citizen jumped much as one may jump when he has waited in nerve racking suspense for a pistol shot the boy had done exactly what he had expected him to do broken that sacred ante prandial hour with the lindon evening news which judith had not broken this twenty years illustration snow he said discouragingly for all he had determined to ignore the remark snow is always white jimsy shook his head naw he said n york snow s gray an dirty specks said the snow we seen on the hills from the train winder was christmas card snow and with that the minister he up an tells specks an me christmas trees an an sleigh bells an gifts an wreaths an skatin an holly gee that said abner sawyer with cold finality will be quite enough sure agreed jimsy a christmas like that snuff fur any kid
afternoon when the brewster party were sitting about iced fruit drinks amid the dingy and soiled elegance of the kast s one private parlor mr sherwen immaculate self creaseless except for one furrow of the brow how you are going to get out of here i really do nt know he said why should we hurry inquired miss brewster i do nt find caracuna so uninteresting never since i came here has it been so charming said the legation representative with a smiling bow but much as your party adds to the landscape i m not at all sure that this city is the most healthful spot for you at present you mean the plague asked mr brewster not quite so loud please healthful as i used it was in part a figure of speech something is brewing hereabout not a revolution cried miss polly with eyes alight oh do brew a revolution for me i should so adore to see one possibly you may though at most the dutch blockade is perhaps only a beginning however it s sufficient to keep you bottled up though if we could get word to them i dare say they would let a yacht go out senator richland of the committee on foreign relations is an old friend of my family said carroll in his measured tones a cable would probably never get through this government would nt allow it there are other possibilities perhaps mr brewster he continued with a side glance at the girl we might talk it over at length this evening quite useless mr sherwen smiled the magnate polly would have it all out of me before i was an hour older she may as well get it direct very well then it s this quarantine business if dr pruyn comes here and declares bubonic plague but how will he as the blockade goes the dutch will help him all they can but this government will keep him out if possible he is not persona grata asked brewster not with any of the countries that play politics with pestilence but if he s sent here he ll get in some way in fact stark the public health surgeon at puerto del norte let fall a hint that makes me think he s on his way now probably in some cockleshell of a small boat manned by indian smugglers it sounds almost too adventurous for the scholarly pruyn whom i recall observed mr brewster the man who went through the cholera anarchy on the lazar island off camacho with one case of medical supplies and two boxes of cartridges may have been scholarly he certainly did nt exhibit any distaste for adventure well i wish he d arrive and get something settled only i d like to have you out of the way away mr sherwen pleaded miss polly with mischief in her eyes i d make the cunningest little office assistant to busy old dr pruyn and he s a friend of dad s and we surely ought to wait for him if only i could send you the fact is americans wo nt be very popular if matters turn out as i expect shall we be confined to our rooms and kept incomunicado while dr pruyn chases the terrified germ through the streets of caracuna queried the irrepressible polly you ll probably have to move to the legation where you will be very welcome but none too comfortable the place has been practically closed and sealed for two months i m sure we should bother you dreadfully said the girl it would bother me more dreadfully if you got into any trouble just this morning there was some kind of an affair on a street car in which some americans design a very dainty and ornamental design in insouciance as her father said americans any one we have met no news has come to me i understand one of the diplomatic corps returning from the president s matinee spoke to an american woman and an american man interfered when did this happen asked carroll about noon inquiries are going on quietly the young man directed a troubled and accusing look from his fine eyes upon miss brewster you see miss polly he said no lady should go about unprotected down here ordinarily it s as safe as any city said sherwen just now i ca nt be so certain i hate being watched over like a child pouted miss brewster and i love sight seeing alone the flowers along the calvario road were so lovely that s the road to the palace remarked carroll looking marvelous she continued cheerfully who lives in that salmon pink pagoda just this side of the curve trouble sat dark and heavy upon the handsome features of mr preston fairfax fitzhugh carroll but he was too experienced to put a direct query to his inamorata what suspicion he had he cherished until after dinner when he took it to the club and made it the foundation of certain inquiries thus it happened that at eleven o clock that evening he paused before a bench in the plaza bowered in the bloom of creepers which flowed down from a balcony of the kast and occupied by the comfortably sprawled out form of mr thomas cluff who was making a burnt offering to morpheus good evening said mr carroll pleasantly evenin how s things returned the other right as can be thanks to you on behalf of the brewster family i want to express our appreciation of your assistance to miss brewster this morning but it might have been a great deal mr brewster will wish to thank you in person aw forget it besought mr thomas cluff that little lady is all right i d just as soon eat an ambassador let alone a gilt framed secretary to help her out miss brewster said the other somewhat more stiffly is a wholly admirable young
as children play fell dull upon his ears the unsolicited complaints of wives and mothers all unsatisfied with life while crowned with every blessing earth can give longing for god knows what to bring content and openly or with appealing look asking for sympathy the first blind step that leads from wifely honour down to shame is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy he saw proud women who would flush and pale with sense of outraged modesty if one spoke of the ancient sin before them bare to all men s sight or flimsily conceal by veils that bid adventurous eyes proceed charms meant alone for lover and for child he saw chaste virgins tempt and tantalise lure and deny invite and then refuse and drive men forth half crazed to wantons arms mother you taught me there were but two kinds of women in the world the good and bad but you have been too sheltered in the safe old fashioned sweetness of your quiet life to know how women of why i have been more tempted and more shocked by belles and beauties in the social whirl by trusted wives and mothers in their homes than by the women of the underworld who sell their favours do you think me mad no mother i am sane but very sad i miss my boyhood s faith in woman s worth torn from my heart by good folks of the earth the younger born the modern english speaking young girl is the astonishment of the world and the despair of the older generation nothing like her has ever been seen or heard before alike in drawing rooms and the amusement places of the people she defies conventions in dress speech and conduct she is bold yet not immoral she is immodest yet she is chaste she has no ideals yet she is kind and generous she is an anomaly and a paradox we are the little daughters of time and the world his wife we are not we are marred with our mother s follies and torn with our father s strife we are the little daughters of the modern world and time her spouse she has brought many children to our father s house before we came when both our parents were content with simple pleasures and with quiet homely ways modest and mild were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days modest and mild but father time grew restless and longed for a swifter pace and our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender grace and life was no more living but just a headlong race and we are wild yea wild are we the younger born of the world into life s vortex hurled with the milk of our mother s breast we drank her own unrest and we learned our speech from time who scoffs at the things sublime time and the world have hurried so they could not help their younger born to grow we only follow behind them as they ran there was but one goal pleasure for woman or for man and they robbed the nights of slumber to lengthen the days brief span we are the demi virgins of the modern day all evil on the earth is known to us in thought but yet we do it not we bare our beauteous bodies to the gaze of men we lure them tempt them lead them on and then lightly we turn away by strong compelling passion we are never stirred to us it is a word a word much used when tragic tales are told we are the younger born yet we are very old in understanding and our knowledge makes us bold boldly we look at life loving its stress and strife and hating all conventions that may mean restraint yet shunning sin s black taint we know wine s taste and the young maiden bloom and sweetness of our lips is often in eclipse under the brown weed s large capacity for joy or pain but an insatiable appetite for pleasure we have no use for leisure and never learned the meaning of that word repose life as it goes must spell excitement for us be the cost what may speeding along the way we ofttimes pause to do some generous little deed and fill the cup of need for we are kind at heart though with less heart than head unmoral not immoral when the worst is said we are the product of the modern day we are the little daughters of time and the world his wife we are not like the children born in their younger life we are marred with our mother s follies and torn with our father s strife happiness there are so many little things that make life beautiful i can recall a day in early youth when i was longing for happiness toward the western hills i gazed watching for its approach the hills lay between me and when some traveller crossed the hill always a fine grey dust rose cloudless against the sky the traveller i could not distinguish but the dust cloud i could see and the dust cloud seemed formed of hopes and possibilities each speck an embryo event at sunset when the skies were fair the dust cloud grew radiant and shone with visions the happiness for which i waited came not to me adown that western slope but now i can recall the cloud of golden dust the sunset and the highway leading over the hill the wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart the visions of youth in my eyes and i know this was happiness there are so many little things that make life beautiful i can recall another day when i rebelled at life s monotony everywhere about me was the commonplace and nothing seemed to happen each day was like its yesterday and to morrow
a cruel idea commented the trained nurse perhaps but i believe organized charity even of that sort is usually ineffective and weakens the race that accepts it i believe victims of such disaster are healthier and surviving as fate decrees keep off the grass cried the youngster i brought back a car full of books the hint was taken and we talked of books until the coffee came out as usual the trained nurse sat behind the pot and when we were all served she pushed the tray back folded her strong capable white hands on the edge of the table and said quietly messieurs et mesdames we lit our cigarettes and she began it was the first year after i left home and took up nursing i had a room at that time in one of the friendly society refuges on the lower side of beacon hill it was under the auspices of an episcopal high church in the days of father hall and was rather english in tone indeed its matron was an englishwoman gentle round faced lace capped and very sympathetic i was very fond of her i had josephine was a tiny creature all grey in tone with mouse colored hair she was a foundling she had not the least notion who her people were her first recollections were of the orphan asylum where she was brought up in her early teens she had been bound out to a dressmaker who had been kind to her and when her first employer died josephine who had saved a little money and longed for independence began to go out as a seamstress among the women she had grown to know in the dressmaking establishment and went to live at one of the christian association homes for working girls every one knows what those boarding houses are two or three hundred girls of all ages from sixteen up of all temperaments all girls willing to submit to control girls with their gay days and their tragic girls of ambition and girls with faith in the future as well as girls of no luck and girls with their simple youthful romances a little lady dainty in her ways industrious unrebellious always ready to help the other girls about their clothes and a model of a confidant every one told her their little troubles every one confided their little romances they were sure of a good listener who never had any troubles or romances of her own to confide i do nt know how old josephine was at that time she might have been twenty five looked younger but was perhaps older she was so tiny and such a mouse of a thing that she seemed a child but for her energy and her capacity for silence it was i fancy three years after i first knew her that she one evening confided to a group of her intimate friends as they sat together over their sewing that she was engaged to be married there was a great excitement little lonely josephine so discreet who had sympathized with the romances of so many of her comrades had kissing as went on you never saw unless you have seen a crowd of such girls together every one was full of questions and there were almost as many tears shed as questions asked he was a carpenter josephine told them she had known him ever since she was with the dressmaker who took her out of the asylum he lived in utica new york he had a good job and they were to be married as soon as she could get ready so josephine set to work with her nimble fingers to make her trousseau during the years she had worked for me the matron at the friendly society and many of its patrons had come to know and love dear little josephine and in our house there was almost as much excitement over the news as there was at the association at the south end all the girls set to work to make something for little josephine every one for whom she had worked gave her something one lady gave sewed a bit of underwear for her she had sheets and table linen and all sorts of dainty things which her girl friends loved to count over and admire in the evening without the least bit of envy by the time spring came josephine had to buy a new trunk to pack her things away in then she told us all that she was going to utica to be married what was the use of his spending his money to come east for her and pay his expenses back that seemed reasonable and the day was fixed for her departure her trunks were packed she took a night train so that we could all go to the station to see her off and i am sure that the crowd who saw us kissing her good bye are not likely to forget the scene then the girls went home chattering about dear little josephine in due time came a letter from a place near utica where she was she said on her little and he sent his love and it was signed with her new name and she would send us her address as soon as she was settled time went by some months then she did send an address but she did not write often and when she did she said little but that she was happy as nearly as i can remember it was a year and a half after she left that news came that josephine had a son by that time a great many of the girls she had known were gone changes come fast in such a place but there was great rejoicing and those who had known her found time to make something for dear little josephine s baby and the sending of the things kept up
not explain to you just how deeply i am interested in the saving of human life that comes first with me my theories as you call them come second i can not undertake the promotion of these theories as a salaried advocate this is the only stupid and impractical thing that my grandfather ever did i believe he must have known that the terms of the will could not be carried out mr dodge is to me after declaring that he would not do so after adding the codicil annulling the bequest intended for me he broke a solemn compact now he has made the situation absolutely impossible i shall not act as trustee of this fund and i shall not use a penny of the fortune as i see fit judge hollenback there must be some other channel into which all this money can be diverted without there is no provision sir as i said before said judge hollenback testily it can only be released by an act of yours that is clear quite clear then i shall find a way said braden resolutely i shall go into court and ask to have the will set aside as that s it sir that s it came an eager voice from an unexpected quarter wade was leaning forward in his chair visibly excited by the prospect of relief i yes very queerly during the past few months i should say that he was of unsound mind then as every eye was upon him he subsided as suddenly as he had begun shut up whispered murray murderously bending over the better to penetrate his ear you damn fool judge hollenback indulged in a frosty smile mr wade is evidently bewildered then turning to braden he said mr dodge s advice is excellent think the matter over for a few days and then come to see me i am placed in a most unhappy position said braden with dignity mrs thorpe appreciates my feelings i am sure she was led to believe as i was that my grandfather had left me out of his will such a thing as this subterfuge never crossed my mind nor hers i wish to assure her in the presence of all of this i know it braden interrupted anne i know that you had nothing to do with it and for that reason i feel that you should accept the trust that is anne cried out braden incredulously you can not mean it you i do mean it she said firmly it is your greatest justification you should carry out his wishes he does not leave you the money outright you may do as you please with it to be sure but why should you agree with simmy that it may be converted solely to your own private uses why should you feel that he intended you to have it all for your own does he not set forth explicitly just what uses it is to be put to by you during your lifetime he puts you on your honour he knew what he was about when he overruled judge hollenback s objection he knew that this trust would be safe that you would not spend a penny of it on yourself he was staring at her blankly mrs tresslyn was speaking now but it is doubtful if he heard a word that she uttered he was intent only upon the study of anne s warm excited face mr thorpe assured me a little over a year ago began anne s mother a hard light in her eyes that it was his determination to leave his grandson out of his will altogether it was his desire or at least so he said to remove from braden s path every obstacle that might interfere with his becoming a great man and a credit to his name by that of course he meant money unearned he told me that most of his fortune was to go to charitable and scientific institutions i had his solemn word of honour that his grandson was to be in no sense a beneficiary under his will he please mother broke eyes and so how are we to reconcile this present foolishness with his very laudable display of commonsense of a year ago went on mrs tresslyn the red spot darkening in her cheek he played fast and loose with all of us i agree with braden thorpe there was treachery in ahem coughed judge hollenback so loudly and so pointedly that the angry sentence was not completed mrs tresslyn was furious she had been cheated and anne had been cheated the old wretch had played a trick on all of them he had bought anne for two millions and now nothing absolutely nothing was to go to charity braden was seven times a millionaire instead of a poor but ambitious seeker after fame in the few minutes that followed judge hollenback s cough she had time to restore her equanimity to its habitual elevation it had for once stooped perilously near to catastrophe meanwhile her son george had arrived at a conclusion a half uttered groan and crossed over to braden s side strange fierce pains were shooting through all the joints and muscles of his body see here brady i d like to ask a question if you do nt mind i do nt mind what is it would you have operated on mr thorpe if you d known what was in this will braden hesitated but only for a second yes my grandfather asked me to operate there was nothing else for me to do under the circumstances that s just what i thought well all i ve got to say is that so long as you respected his wishes while he was alive it seems pretty rotten in you to take the stand you re taking now what do you mean he virtually asked you to make an end

grandmother of course she looked at phyllis with a wistful hope in her eyes phyllis thoughtfully lifted the this is a lovely material she said thoughtfully is it the color you do nt like n no joy answered doubtfully it s the make then she burst out passionately i want to look frisky she declared i want to be dressed the way john s used to seeing girls i i want to look just as pretty and like folks as gail maddox she checked herself flushing and biting her lip she had nt meant to say that but phyllis took it beautifully no reason why you should nt look just exactly like folks she soothed this is lovely too this silver tissue goodness what a lot of material there is in these angel sleeves she held it up consideringly wait a minute joy i think i read my title clear she ran out of the room coming back in a moment with a life size here s dora the dress model she said cheerfully she adjusts in proof she began to screw dora down and in to required proportions measuring her by joy who watched operations with fascinated eyes i never knew you could sew she said my father was a country minister mrs harrington explained flinging the green frock inside out over the steely shoulders of dora the dress frame i cook very nicely if i do say it myself and till i was seventeen i did every bit of my own sewing and were you married at seventeen no phyllis answered stopping a moment from her pinnings and speaking more gravely my father died then and i went to work i had nt time to sew after that i bought ready made things so when i was married that was a long seven years afterwards i did have such lovely times buying organdies and that was the summer allan was getting well she stared off at the wall for a moment as she knelt up against the green satin that was the loveliest summer i ever had excepting every one since she laughed a little then prevented herself from further speech by putting a frieze of pins in her mouth and beginning to do something with the dress with them one by one do you mind cutting into this she asked when that row was gone the more the better said joy with enthusiasm it will make a stunning frock with the silver net draped over the pale green satin m m that silver iridescent girdle on the other dress the violet can i have that too joy ripped and handed with tremulously eager hands while phyllis swiftly cut away the sleeves of the green dress and slashed a decolletage and draped the net over it and pinned on the girdle try if she invited lifting the frock gingerly off dora and dropping it over joy then she wheeled her around to where she could see her reflection in the tall pier glass between the windows of course that s rough she told her but what do you think of it generally are there any changes you want oh not one joy replied ecstatically regarding the slim little green and silver figure in the glass it needs to be shorter meditated phyllis aloud and fell to pinning it up to the proper shortness joy continued to look at it rapturously it had been a straight long gown and all phyllis had needed to do was to drape it with the net ripped from the other dress and shorten and cut it into fashionableness it was charming springlike and becoming and best of all strictly up to date do nt you think you ll feel equal to being the feature of the certainly should in your place that is if you have silver slippers i have and i think i do said joy gravely then i ll hand this over to viola to put the finishing stitches in look out the window do you see anything familiar coming up the path joy in her pinned finery looked then snatched her clothes from the sofa where they lay in state and ran upstairs john was coming along the path and she did nt want him to know about her frock till it was all done she came down a moment later brown clad and demure and looking so young and harmless that any man would have been sure his tilt with her of the night before was a dream she greeted him shyly with her lashes down is nt is nt it a little early for you to be away from your patients she asked my morning office hours are make some calls in the car want to come he asked thank you said joy that is if you do nt think i d be in the way if i thought you would be i would nt have asked you said dr hewitt matter of factly so run along and pin up your hair child i do nt want people to think i ve been robbing the cradle herself for trying to tease him even if he did nt seem to see it she liked him so much apart from any other feeling that it was hard to be anything but nice and grateful to him except when she thought of gail maddox it just takes two hairpins she informed him coming over to him and holding up the ends of her braids you wind it round and pin it behind he took the hairpins and the braids and quite deftly did as she asked him to yet with a certain note of affection in his voice that made joy feel very comforted as she flew to get her cap her heart gave a queer pleasant sort of turn over his voice made her feel so belonging she sang as she went and phyllis and john smiled across at each
you think that your creative fire will blaze if instead of throwing in your wet raw thoughts you feed it a few seasoned bits you open therefore the drawer of your desk where you keep your rejected and broken fragments for your past has not been prosperous hopeful against experience that you can recast one of these to your present mood this is mournful business certain paragraphs that came from you hot are now patched and shivery their finer meaning has run out between the lines of the page you had best put on your hat you will get no comfort from these stale papers one evening lately being in this plight i spread out before me certain odds and ends i had dug deeper than usual in the drawer and had brought up a yellow stratum of a considerable age i was poring upon these papers and was wondering whether i could fit them to a newer measure when i heard a slight noise behind me i glanced around and saw that a man had entered the room and was now seated in a chair before the fire in the common nature of things this should have been startling for the hour was late twelve o clock had struck across the way and i had thought that i was quite alone but there was something so friendly and easy in his attitude he was a young man little more than a lanky boy that instead of being frightened i swung calmly around for a better look he sat resting in his hand as though in thought by the light that fell on him from the fire i saw that he wore a brown checked suit and that he was clean and respectable in appearance his face was in shadow good evening i said you startled me i am sorry he replied i beg your pardon i was going by and i saw your light i wished to make your acquaintance but i saw at once that i was intruding so i sat here you were quite absorbed would you mind if i mended the fire without waiting for an answer he took the poker and dealt the logs several blows it did nt greatly help the flame but he poked with such enjoyment that i smiled i have myself rather a liking for stirring a fire he set another log in place then he drew from his pocket a handful of dried orange peel i love it crackles and spits he ranged the peel upon the log where the flame would get it and then settled himself in the big chair perhaps you smoke i asked pushing toward him a box of cigarettes he smiled i thought that you would know my habits i do nt smoke so you were going by and came up to see me i asked yes i was not sure that i would know you you are a little older than i thought a little stouter but dear me how you have lost your hair but you have quite forgotten me my dear boy i said you have the advantage of me where have i seen you there is something familiar about you and i am sure that i have seen that brown suit before we have never really known each other the boy replied we met once but you since that meeting a great many times i lay this afternoon on a hilltop and wondered what you would be like but i hoped that sometimes you would think of me perhaps you have forgotten that i used to collect railway maps and time tables did you i replied so did i when i was a little younger than you are perhaps if i might see your face i would know you it s nothing for show he replied and he kept it still in shadow would you mind he said at length if i ate an apple he took one from his pocket and broke it in his hands you eat half he said i accepted the part he offered me perhaps you would like a knife and plate i said i can find them in the pantry not for me he replied i prefer to bite i myself care nothing for plates i said we ate in silence presently you have my habit i said of eating everything skin seeds and all everything but the stem he replied by this time the orange peel was hissing and exploding you are an odd boy i said i used to put orange peel away to dry in order to burn it we seem to be as like as two peas i wonder he said if that is so he turned in his chair and faced me although his face was still in shadow doubtless we are far different in many things do you swallow grape seeds hardly i cried i spit them out i am glad of that he paused it was a breezy hilltop where i lay i thought of you dear me no oh i m so sorry i had hoped you might be i had counted on it it is very disappointing i was thinking about that as i lay on the hill but are nt you just on the point of doing something that will make you famous by no means dear me i am so sorry do you happen to be married yes and would you mind telling me her name i obliged him i do nt remember to have heard of her i did nt think of that name once as i lay upon the hill things do nt turn out as one might expect now i would have thought but it s no matter for a moment or so he was lost in thought and then he spoke again you were writing when i came into the room nothing important the his arms impatiently that s what
honor and recognition and you re selfish enough to spoil it all i ve never spoken to norma berwynd in any way to which her husband or you could object therefore i resent your attitude my attitude i m your wife he took a turn across the stage followed by her eyes pausing before her at length he said quietly now i insist upon it if you are here when i return i shall dismiss the rehearsal i refuse to allow our domestic relations to interfere with my business he strode out to the front of the house and then paced the dark foyer striving to master his emotions a moment later he saw his wife leave the stage and assumed that she had obeyed his admonitions and gone home the property man appeared with an armful of draperies and mechanical appliances interrupting his whistling long enough to call out here s the new hangings mr phillips and the oriental rugs i ve got the dagger too he held a gleaming object on high believe me it s some davy crockett there s a newspaper guy out back and he wants your ideas on the american drama i told him they were great will you see him not now tell him to come back later say that john danton is some character because well because it does nt happen in real life and i ve tried to make this play real more than anything else when norma berwynd and her husband arrived phillips had completely regained his composure and he greeted them cordially the woman seemed awed half frightened by her sudden rise to fame she seemed to be walking in a dream and a great wonder dwelt in her eyes as for francis he returned the author s greeting curtly making it plain that he was in no agreeable temper i congratulate you phillips he said you and norma have become famous overnight the open resentment in his tone angered the playwright and caused him to wonder if their long deferred clash was destined to occur this morning he knew himself to be overwrought and he imagined francis to be in no better frame of mind nevertheless he answered pacifically if that is so we owe it to your art what i failed to detect in reading and rehearsing the piece and what you neglected to tell me namely that this is a woman s play there s nothing in it for me there s nothing in my part oh come now the part is tremendous you merely have nt got the most out of it as yet francis drew himself up and eyed the speaker coldly you re quoting the newspapers pray be more original you know of course how i stand with these penny a liners they never have liked me but as for the part he shrugged i ca nt get any more out of it than there is in it doubtless that was my fault at rehearsals i ve called this one so we can fix up the weak spot in the third act well we re on time where are the others francis cast an inquiring glance about i ll the former speaker opened his mouth for a cutting rejoinder but changed his mind and stalked away into the shadowy depths of the wings please make allowances for him norma begged approaching phillips in order that her words might not be overheard i ve never seen him so broken up over anything he is always unstrung after an opening but he is terrible this morning there was trouble timidity and another indefinable expression in the woman s eyes as they followed the vanishing figure of her husband faint lines appeared at the corners of her mouth lines which had no place in the face of a happily married woman she was trembling moreover as if she had but recently played some big emotional role and phillips felt the old aching pity for her tugging at his heart he wondered if those stories about francis could be true it has been a great strain on all of us he told her this he indicated the pile of morning papers and at sight of them her eyes suddenly filled with that same wonder and gladness he had noticed when she first arrived oh h i i m breathless something clutches me here she laid her hand upon her bosom it s so new i ca nt express it yet except well all of my dreams came true in a night some fairy waved her wand and lo poor ugly little me she laughed although it was more like a sob i had no idea my part was so immense had you i had i wrote it that way my dreams also came true but why a faint flush stole into her cheeks there are so many women who could have played the part better than i you had courage to risk your piece in my hands mr phillips perhaps i knew his face with startled curiosity or better at least than the world knew you tell me there is something wrong i m afraid he resents your oh no no she denied hastily letting her eyes fall but not before he had seen them fill again with that same expression of pain and bewilderment he s not himself that s all i you wo nt irritate him please he has such a temper francis came out of the shadows scowling well let s get at it said he phillips agreed if you do nt mind we ll start with your entrance i wish you would try to express more depth of feeling more tenderness if you please mr francis remember john danton has fought this love of his for many years undertaking to remain loyal to his wife he does nt dream that diane returns his love for he until this instant now however they are
his young chickens of course that left very few for them and that the wild berry crop was poor everybody agreed with the stranger and everybody nodded his head as if to say that s quite true at least everybody but mr crow he was determined that he would not agree with anything the stranger said and so he shouted nonsense at the top of his lungs a murmur ran through the meeting and there were cries of put him out that s what i say too mr crow bellowed and then he could hardly believe his ears when someone near him said they mean you xxii the test well he found that some people wanted to put him out of the meeting just because he had said one word had he not always talked more than anybody else at those sunset meetings in the pine woods luckily no one made a move to oust him and he managed to keep silent for a little while but he was so angry that he did not hear what the stranger was saying at last however mr crow began to pay attention again do you want to know why times are hard and food is scarce in this neighborhood the impudent fellow asked everybody except old mr crow answered yes and after the echo had died away the stranger continued it s because you need a new leader he declared i understand that a person called old mr crow has been your leader for a good many years and my advice to you friends is this get rid of him a good the older and wiser of his listeners shook their heads who is there that could take mr crow s place a voice called at that question the stranger coughed slightly and said of course i would nt suggest any one specially being a newcomer here myself and if the position were offered to me i do nt know that i could accept it though i have had so much experience the young fellows on the limb with mr crow at once set up a great cawing we want you they chanted old mr crow might have been a scarecrow for all the attention they paid to him and he did not dare open his mouth many others took up the cry and a great hub bub arose a beating of wings and flying up and down and jostling some of the younger ones squawked like chickens others pretended to cry like children but most of the company cawed in their loudest tones until the old mr crow s best friends spoke up and said it s plain that a good many people want you for a leader stranger then i d be very happy to act as such the bold fellow replied and i ll begin at once but the elderly person who had just spoken said that there was no hurry and that the stranger ought first to be put to a test we want to make sure that you re a good leader he explained and i would suggest that you go to see farmer green to morrow tell him that we object to his putting tar on his corn and ask him not to do it again next spring the stranger looked somewhat uneasy as he listened but after he had pondered for a few moments he said briskly i ll do that i ll go to farmer green to morrow he wo nt be busy for to morrow s sunday and i ll we ll meet again on monday at sunset mr crow s friend announced and then the meeting broke up in the wildest disorder as for old mr crow he crept away without speaking to anyone and always before he had made more noise than any ten of the others xxiii the white flag unhappy mr crow could scarcely eat a mouthful of food after that meeting on saturday night when he found the stranger talking to the gathering he was worried because he knew that if the stranger succeeded in getting farmer green to promise that he would not put tar on his corn the following spring everybody would choose the newcomer to be the leader of all the crows in pleasant valley and that was an honor that old mr crow had had for years for two whole days he sulked at home he would nt even go to his door when anybody knocked but on monday evening mr crow was the first to reach the meeting place in the pine woods leader s seat and there he intended to stay as long as he could at last his neighbors came straggling to the woods and when the stranger arrived he seemed annoyed because he could not have mr crow s seat and he said in an undertone to mr crow i advise you to go home the old gentleman glared at him and he answered in a loud voice i advise you to go home yourself if you have a home to go to now some people thought that mr crow s answer was a good one so they laughed and that made the stranger feel quite uncomfortable but there were others who spoke up and said that mr crow s remark was very unkind they knew that the stranger had a beautiful home further north because he had told them all about it and that made him feel better once more then old mr crow called the meeting to order and immediately the stranger announced in a loud voice then there was even more noise than is usual at a crow caucus it was a long time before old mr crow could quiet the meeting but he succeeded at last and when it was still he said to the stranger how do you know farmer green has surrendered it was so quiet that you could have heard a pine needle
trunk and the two peered at the group around the fire some kind of an indian pow wow half breeds mostly whispered kent lydia shivered do nt they look fierce in the firelight she murmured let s get out of here kent shucks be a sport lyd we ll watch them a minute then i ll brace up and speak to store clothes and moccasins squatting around the blaze none of them was speaking they act as if they were waiting for some one whispered lydia with some of the old thrill of pirate plays returning to her kent they ve all got guns hush there comes some one else for the love of cats john levine emerged from the darkness of the forest into the fire glow how he grunted slipping into an empty space opposite the two eavesdroppers how returned the indians silence in the woods except for the crackling fire kent let s go i do nt want to listen i do nt want to know the cold sweat was standing on lydia s forehead kent seized her arm you ve got to stay it s your business to know he whispered sharply where s eagle s feather asked levine sick i got back from washington today big fight there marshall and his crowd they ll make a big fight i may have to compromise i may make my bill read only mixed bloods can sell their lands not full bloods good said an indian full blood do nt want to sell anyhow better for you mixed bloods agreed levine because you ll get higher prices for your land but worse for us whites for there ll be less land unless you mixed bloods should happen to swear the full bloods are mixed too no one spoke for a minute then a fat yellow faced half breed laughed i ll swear old chief dawn had a white great grandmother i ll get even with him for throwing me out of the council exactly said levine it ll be a good way for all of you to pay up old debts any of marshall s men one of the younger indians said some young fellows been going through the woods measuring out a road and they acted like they was just out for a vacation when any one was around a year ago i see one of the fellows riding out with marshall levine grunted lydia s heart was pounding so hard that it really pained her she stared at john unbelievably yet it was the same familiar sallow face with the gaunt look about the cheeks only the eyes were strange lydia had never seen them so hard so searching before kent was breathing deep and he did not loose his hold on her arm well said levine is that all you folks have got to report after six months what do you think i m paying you for an old mixed blood almost as dark as a full blood removed his pipe from his mouth all the shoes we buy this year made out of paper woman at last chance tell me injun agent tell her he gets those shoes from marshall the hog grunted levine anything more what more might have come lydia did not know for an old squaw came tottering into the fire glow she was gray headed and emaciated oh that s our old squaw kent remember whispered lydia shut up murmured kent the squaw made her way up to john there was something sinister in the look of her and he rose what you do now white man she snarled steal steal more eh levine looked down on her and his voice was pitying why you poor old devil you look half starved he dug into his pocket and brought out a silver dollar go get some grub he said the old woman stared from the dollar to levine s face and her voice rose to a men drunk make our young girls have babies that grow like these snakes she pointed a trembling scrawny finger at the scowling mixed bloods white man dirty fool dirty thief and she spat at levine at the same time striking the dollar from his hand it rolled out onto the needles and lay shining in the firelight john stiffened and the mixed bloods watched him curiously but the squaw suddenly burst into the feeble yet deep drawn sobs of the old and tottering over to the silver she picked it up hungry she sobbed all the time much hungry and she started slowly away from the fire in the direction of kent and lydia s hiding place quick whispered kent and noiselessly the two ran back into the darkness of the woods through which however a silver light was beginning to filter there s the moon he said in a low voice now i can find the lake silence toward the rising moon in less than half a mile they found the lake and far around its curving shore the gleam of their own camp fire holy mike what do you think of that demanded kent as they headed for the fire is nt levine a wonder oh kent gasped lydia what shall we do do cried kent why keep our mouths shut and see what happens lord what an adventure lyd i would nt have missed this day for a hundred dollars lydia scarcely heard him john levine she murmured my best friend oh i ca nt believe it shucks why that s life gee what rich pickings me for the real estate business kent it s stealing just as my squaw said and it s just the meanest dirtiest kind of stealing have got to have that land and if a lot of sentimental grannies wo nt let us get it openly we ve got to get it quietly they were nearing the camp now and kent stopped and in the moonlight
d been feeling too miserable to get up and drive them that very night it happened she got her cattle home turned them into the corral and went into the house into her room behind the kitchen and shut the door there without calling to anybody without a groan she lay down on the bed and bore her child i was basement stairs out of breath and screeching baby come baby come she says ambrosch much like devil brother william is surely a patient man he was just ready to sit down to a hot supper after a long day in the fields without a word he rose and went down to the barn and hooked up his team he got us over there as quick as it was humanly possible i went right in and began to do for antonia but she laid there with her eyes shut and took no account of me the old woman got a tubful of warm water to wash the baby i overlooked what she was doing and i said out loud mrs shimerda do nt you put that strong yellow soap near that baby you ll blister its little skin i was indignant illustration antonia driving her cattle home mrs steavens antonia said from the bed if you ll see some fine soap that was the first word she spoke after i d dressed the baby i took it out to show it to ambrosch he was muttering behind the stove and would nt look at it you d better put it out in the rain barrel he says now see here ambrosch says i there s a law in this land do nt forget that i stand here a witness that this baby has come into the world sound and strong and i intend to keep an eye on what befalls it i pride myself i cowed him well i expect you re not much interested in babies but antonia s got on fine she loved it from the first as dearly as if she d had a ring on her finger and was never ashamed of it it s a year and eight months old now and no baby was ever better she could marry and raise a family but i do nt know as there s much chance now i slept that night in the room i used to have when i was a little boy with the summer wind blowing in at the windows bringing the smell of the ripe fields i lay awake and watched the moonlight shining over the barn and the stacks and the pond and the windmill making its old dark shadow against the blue sky iv the next afternoon i walked over to the shimerdas yulka showed me the baby and told me that antonia was shocking wheat on the southwest quarter i went down across the fields and tony saw me from a long way off she stood still by her shocks leaning on her pitchfork watching me as i came we met like the people in the old song in silence if not in tears her warm hand clasped mine i thought you d come jim i heard you were at for you all day she was thinner than i had ever seen her and looked as mrs steavens said worked down but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity of her face and her color still gave her that look of deep seated health and ardor still why it flashed across me that though so much had happened in her life and in mine she was barely twenty four years old antonia stuck her fork in the ground and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other we sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut mr shimerda s plot off from the rest of the world the tall red grass had never been cut there it had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden grass i found myself telling her everything why i had decided to study law and to s relatives in new york city about gaston cleric s death from pneumonia last winter and the difference it had made in my life she wanted to know about my friends and my way of living and my dearest hopes of course it means you are going away from us for good she said with a sigh but that do nt mean i ll lose you look at my papa here he s been dead all these years and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else he never goes out of my life i talk to him and consult him all the time the older i grow the better i know him and the more i understand him she asked me whether i had learned to like big cities i d always be miserable in a city i d die of lonesomeness i like to be where i know every stack and tree and where all the ground is friendly i want s put into this world for something and i know what i ve got to do i m going to see that my little girl has a better chance than ever i had i m going to take care of that girl jim i told her i knew she would do you know antonia since i ve been away i think of you more often than of any one else in this part of the world i d have liked to have you for a sweetheart or a wife or my mother or my sister anything that a woman can be to a man the idea of you is a part of my mind you influence my likes and dislikes
started for the duck pond back at the meeting place once more freddie firefly rushed up to jimmy rabbit in great excitement do you know what you did he cried you brought me the wrong picture and dusty moth has gone shrieking off into the darkness he was so disappointed this is not betsy butterfly s picture it s some dreadful looking caterpillar and when i glanced at it just now over in the orchard it sent a chill all through me for the time being jimmy rabbit said but before freddie had finished speaking he had begun to smile and then he unwrapped the picture once more and leaned it against a stone where the moon s rays fell squarely upon it you re mistaken he informed freddie then this is a picture of betsy butterfly i painted it myself and i ought to know as i explained last night i made it earlier in the summer and as i said she has changed somewhat in the meantime but it s a very good likeness of her as she was once you mean gasped freddie firefly you mean that betsy butterfly was once an ugly caterpillar why certainly said jimmy rabbit and so was dusty moth for that matter yes he was a caterpillar himself once and a much uglier one than betsy if only he knew it in fact said jimmy looking at the picture with his head on one side great beauty even at so early an age xxii the skipper in farmer green s meadow there lived a very nervous person called the skipper he was a distant cousin of betsy butterfly s and since the two were almost exactly the same age they quite naturally spent a good deal of time together the skipper was of a dark somber brown shade and it always seemed to the gaily colored betsy that he tried to make up for his dull appearance by being extremely lively in his movements he was forever skipping suddenly from one place to another a trick which had caused people to call him by so odd a name much as she liked this queer cousin betsy often found his uncertain habit somewhat annoying it was not very pleasant when talking to him to discover that he had unexpectedly left her when she supposed he was right beside her or behind her if she had anything important to tell him she frequently had to hurry after him and the worst never knew when he would dart away again as the summer lengthened it seemed to betsy butterfly that the skipper grew more flighty than ever once she had been able to say a few words to him before he went swooping off but now now she could not even tell him that it was a nice day without following her cousin at least half an hour in order to finish her remark you re becoming terribly fidgety betsy told him at last if you do nt look out you ll have nervous prostration or i shall if you do nt stop jumping about like a jack in the box i advise you she said to see a doctor before you get any worse of course it must not be supposed that betsy butterfly could say all that to her cousin without going to a good deal of trouble as a matter of fact she had to follow him about the fields for two whole days and travel several miles before she succeeded in finishing what she feel fine the skipper cried i do nt need a doctor i he started to skip away from the wild morning glory blossom on which he had perched himself but betsy caught him just in time and held him now you listen to me she commanded you re in a dangerous condition some day someone will come to you with an important message and if you go sailing off the way you do how s he ever going to tell the whole message until it s too late perhaps if it was good news it would nt hurt it to keep it a while the skipper asserted cheerfully and he gave a quick spring with the hope of escaping from betsy s grasp but she held him firmly by the coat tails suppose i wanted to warn you not to go near the flower garden because johnnie green was waiting there for you with his net to capture you and put you in his you did nt sit still and listen to me that s so said the skipper i had nt thought of that i d see a doctor at once but i do nt know any go to aunt polly woodchuck under the hill betsy butterfly advised him she s the best doctor for miles around so they went together to call on aunt polly the old lady looked at the skipper and shook her head i ca nt help him she said betsy asked anxiously is his trouble catching no indeed said aunt polly he ca nt stay in one place long enough to give it to anybody well after that betsy saw very little of her cousin the skipper but she did not mind that especially since she soon made the acquaintance of a very agreeable young gentleman who dressed in the height of fashion he wore said that his manners were delightful he never went skipping off while betsy butterfly was talking to him the end illustration the honey bunch books by helen louise thorndyke for little girls from to years

a saloon and had a highball he was not a drinking man at least he never had been one beyond a convivial glass or two with his fellows but he felt that day the need of a little push toward optimism in the back part of the room three men were playing freeze out bud went over and stood because there was nothing else to do and because he was still having some trouble with his thoughts he was lonely without quite knowing what ailed him he hungered for friends to hail him with that cordial hello bud when they saw him coming no one in alpine had said hello bud when he came walking in that day the postmaster bad given him one measuring glance when he had weighed the package of ore but he had not spoken except to name the amount of postage required the bartender had made some remark about the weather and had smiled with a surface friendliness that did not deceive bud for a moment he knew too well that the smile was not for him but for his patronage he watched the game and when the man opposite him pushed back his chair and looking up at bud asked if he wanted to sit in bud went and sat down buying a dollar s worth of chips as an the game was not keen he played for the feeling it gave him of being one of the bunch a man among his friends or if not friends at least acquaintances and such was his varying luck with the cards he played for an hour or so without having won enough to irritate his companions wherefore he rose from the table at supper time calling one young fellow frank quite naturally they went to the alpine house and had supper together and after that they sat in the office and talked about automobiles for an hour which gave bud a comforting sense of having fallen among friends later they strolled over to a picture show which ran films two years behind their first release and charged fifteen cents for the privilege of watching them it was the first theater bud had entered since he left san jose and at the last minute he hesitated tempted to turn back he hated moving pictures they always had love scenes somewhere in the story and tickets and it seemed unfriendly to turn back now he went inside to the jangling of a player piano in dire need of a tuner s service and sat down near the back of the hall with his hat upon his lifted knees which could have used more space between the seats while they waited for the program they talked in low tones a mumble of commonplaces bud forgot for the moment his distaste for such places and let himself slip easily back into the old thought channels the old habits of relaxation after a day s work was done he laughed at the one reel comedy that had for its climax a chase of housemaids policemen and outraged fruit vendors after a well meaning but unfortunate lover he saw the lover pulled ignominiously out of a duck pond and soused relentlessly into a watering trough and laughed with frank and called it some picture he eyed a succession of current events long since gone stale out where the world moved swifter than here in the mountains into close touch with life all the dull months he had spent with cash and the burros dwarfed into a pointless irrelevant incident of his life he felt that he ought to be out in the world doing bigger things than hunting gold that somehow always refused at the last minute to be found he stirred restlessly he was free there was nothing to hold him if he wanted to go the war he believed he would go over and take a hand he could drive an ambulance or a truck current events however came abruptly to an end and presently bud s vagrant half formed desire for achievement merged into biting recollections here was a love drama three reels of it at first bud watched it with only a vague disquieting sense of familiarity then abruptly he recalled too vividly the time and circumstance of his first sight of the picture it was in san jose at the liberty he and marie had been married two days and were living in that so marvelous and so fleeting he had whispered that the girl looked like her and she had leaned heavily against his shoulder in the dusk of lowered lights their hands had groped and found each other and clung the girl did look like marie when she turned her head with that little tilt of the chin when she smiled she was like marie bud leaned forward staring his brows drawn together breathing the short quick breaths of emotion focussed upon one object excluding all else once when frank moved his body a little in the next seat bud s hand went out that way involuntarily the touch of frank s rough coat sleeve recalled him brutally so that he drew away with a wincing movement as though he bad been hurt all those months in the desert all those months of the slow journeying northward all the fought battles with memory when he thought that he had won all gone for nothing their slow anodyne serving but to sharpen upon his knee small beads of moisture oozed out upon his forehead he sat stunned before the amazing revelation of how little time and distance had done to heal his hurt he wanted marie he wanted her more than he had ever wanted her in the old days with a tenderness an impulse to shield her from her own weaknesses her own mistakes then in those old days there had been the glamor of mystery that is called romance that was gone worn
i do just the same said mr dusenberry promptly and it ai nt hard to recall either because nobody buys it but miss tunie scroggs tunie is the all firedest female i ever did see crazy after a husband tunie is he chuckled if i was nt married already i dare say tunie would have worried me into matrimony before now tunie s trouble is that everybody knows her too well men all keep out of her way but she s a dandy tunie is they tell me that when hinterman the plumber hired a new man up to derlingport and tunie found out he was a single feller she went to work and had new plumbing put in her house just so s the feller would have to come within her reach but he got away he did said mr gubb nervously he stood tunie as long as he could and then he threw up his job and went back to derlingport they tell me she do nt do nothin much now but set around the house and think up new ways to git acquainted with men that ai nt heard enough of her to stay shy of her sorry i ai nt got no ink mr gubb it s a matter of no consequential importance thank you said mr gubb and he went out he was distinctly troubled he recalled now that miss scroggs had smiled in a winning way when she spoke to him and that she had quite warmly pressed his hand when she departed with a timid bachelor s extreme fear of designing women mr gubb dreaded another meeting with miss scroggs only his faithfulness to his correspondence school diploma had power to keep him at work on the anonymous wiggle case and he walked thoughtfully toward the home of mrs canterby he went to the back door good afternoon said mr gubb i been a little nervous about that paper i hung onto your walls if i could take a look at it well now mr gubb that s real kind of you said mrs canterby you can look and welcome if you just wait until i excuse myself to miss scroggs is she here asked mr gubb with a hasty glance toward his avenues of escape she just run in to borrow a book to read said mrs canterby and she s having some trouble finding one to suit her taste she s in my lib ry sort of glancing through some books does does she glance through to about near to page fourteen asked mr gubb nervously now that you call it to mind said mrs canterby that s about how far she is glancing through them she s glanced through about sixteen and take myra s lover or the hidden secret but she ai nt sure she come over to borrow weldon shirmer but i had lent that to a friend she was real disappointed i did nt have it mr gubb wiped the perspiration from his face he too would have liked at that moment to have seen a copy of weldon shirmer and to have read what stood at the top of page fourteen if it ai nt too much trouble mrs canterby he said i wish you would sort of fetch that myra book out here without miss scroggs s knowing you done so i got a special reason for it in my deteckative capacity and i wish you would nt mention to miss scroggs about my being here land sakes said mrs canterby what s up now miss scroggs she s right interested in you too she made inquiries of me about you when you a real handsome gentleman mrs canterby laughed coyly and went out and mr gubb dropped into a chair and wiped his face again nervously his eye falling on the kitchen table noted a sheet of writing paper it was the same style of paper as that on which the anonymous wiggle letters had been written he bent forward and glanced at it in blue ink evidently made of indigo dissolved in water was written on the sheet a recipe the writing although undisguised and slanting properly was beyond doubt the same as that of the wiggle letters when mrs canterby returned to the kitchen with myra s lover hidden in the folds of her skirt the perplexed mr gubb held the recipe in his hand by any chance of doubt he said do you happen to be aware of whom wrote this petunia wrote it said mrs canterby promptly and whatever are you being so mysterious for there s no mystery there is often mystery hidden into mince meat recipes when least expected said mr gubb i see you got the book he took it and turned to page fourteen at the top of the page were the words completing a sentence without turning a hair of his head then followed the first complete sentence it ran a woman like you said lord cyril should be loved cherished and obeyed goodness exclaimed mr gubb and handed the book back to mrs canterby why did you say that asked mrs canterby i was just judging by the book that miss scroggs is fond of love and affection in fiction tales he said fond of exclaimed mrs canterby far be it from me to say anything about a neighbor lady but if petunia scroggs ai nt crazy over love and marriage i do nt know what she i recall about tim wentworth furnaces put in and repaired and how hungry petunia used to look after him when he went by in his wagon but she could nt get after him because she has nt a furnace in her house but the minute he hung up the sign chimneys cleaned she was down to his shop and had him up to the place and i know it for a fact for i took some of
the hand torch it was able to cover much more ground at a time and with its help a white envelope half hidden in the long grass could not escape detection jack could easily understand just what had happened to big bob he first flashed into his brain after supper that for the life of him he found it impossible to say positively one thing or the other now he thought he could remember distinctly pushing the important letter through the slot or drop inside the post office and immediately afterwards doubts again assailed him leaving him worse off after each experience if they failed to find the letter and the postmaster and his assistant had no recollection of having noticed it in cancelling the stamps of the heap that went out with the afternoon mail then there was no help for it and poor bob was doomed to wait day after day as even weeks went on always dreading lest each morning was destined to usher in the time when his great crime must come to light and his punishment begin they were soon on the spot and each with his separate light started to carefully examine the long and tangled grass now partly dead that lay on either side of the well worn path across the lots doubtless for when jack on one occasion started to say something he saw the other whirl around as though thrilled with expectations that were immediately doomed to disappointment nothing rewarded their search bob might further satisfy himself and believe he was only doing his duty by coming out again at peep of dawn and once more covering the ground before giving it up as hopeless but jack felt certain nothing would be found if that letter had dropped from the boy s pocket then some one must have long since picked it up he believed he would hear of it if this person being honest delivered the letter at the post office and told how he had come to find it on the vacant lot well it s no use looking any further i guess jack big bob now remarked in a decidedly dejected tone after they had gone twice over the entire width of the three lots and without any success attending their efforts i m afraid not because he felt just as sorry as could be for the poor chap i suppose you ll sleep mighty little tonight for worrying over this thing try your level best to follow out all you did when in the post office some little thing may recall to your mind that you certainly did drop that particular letter in the slot i will jack surely i will bob told him vigorously but i m afraid it wo nt do much good you see i ve become so mixed up by now thinking one thing and then another that no matter what did happen i could nt honestly say i remembered it but i still have a little hope you ll hear good news from mr dickerson or that in the morning it may be handed in at our house for my dad put his full address on the back flap i remember that very distinctly yes i d be willing to stand my gruelling and not whimper looking quite down hearted jack saw really he felt very sorry for big bob jeffries the latter was well liked having a genial disposition like nearly all big boys do the smaller runts being the scrappy ones as a rule as every one knows who has observed the lads in their play hours and made any sort of a study of their characteristics on another occasion jack well remembered he had come very nearly losing one of the best players on the baseball nine when the pitcher alec donohue appeared exceedingly gloomy and confessed to jack that as his father was unable to obtain work in the chester mills and shops and had been offered a position over in harmony he feared that he would thus become ineligible to pitch for chester but jack as so often happened when trouble beset him took the bull by the horns he went and saw a gentleman who could give mr donohue employment and enlisted his sympathy it had all ended right by of work and so alec pitched the great game whereby harmony s famous team went down to a crushing defeat jack could not but take note of the similar conditions by which chester was to be threatened with the loss of one of the strongest members of her team looks as though history liked to repeat itself jack mused as he walked back home after parting company with big bob only in this case it s the football eleven that s liable to be weakened if bob s father takes him out and we never could scare up a fullback equal to him if we raked old chester with a fine tooth comb so i certainly hope it ll all come out right yet i surely do chapter iv a friend in need it lacked only five minutes or so of the school hour on the following morning when jack winters hurrying along was intercepted by a disturbed looking boy who had been impatiently awaiting his arrival of course this was none other than his customary associates ever since arriving and had never once taken his eyes off the street along which he knew jack must come he seized hold of the other eagerly jack needed no second look to convince him that poor bob had passed a wretched night his eyes were red and there was an expression of mute misery on his usually merry face that doubtless had induced more than one fellow to ask if he felt ill no doubt bob had a stereotyped answer to this sympathetic question which was to the effect that he was not feeling himself oh i thought
of the usurper well for pity sakes what are you doing here she demanded he opened his eyes slowly and looked at her she fitted in so well with of the sky and the world s fresh beauty that he took her appearance as a part of the picture and was silent it was only when she repeated her question rather sharply that he sat up to explain why i found this spot months ago it is the stillest most heavenly nook in green valley i come up here whenever i m tired of thinking well i found this place years and years ago nanny complained what s the matter with us both using it he said very civilly but objected nan this is the sort of a place that you want all to yourself yes it is he agreed and did not let the situation worry him further he did nt offer her a seat or give her a chance to take herself off gracefully and nanny was beginning to feel a little awkward she was nt used to being ignored in this strange fashion are you up at her with eyes as innocent and serene as a child s i m twenty three nan was startled into confessing why are nt you married as she gasped and searched about for an answer he added in india a girl is a grandmother at that age this is nt india smiled nan good naturedly for she saw quite suddenly that this big young man knew very little about women especially western women no this is nt india he repeated her words slowly little wrinkles of pain ruffling his face for his inner eye was blotting out the green valley picture and painting in its stead the india of his memory the india of gorgeous color the bazaars the narrow streets the india that held within its mystic arms two plain white stones standing side by side and bearing the inscriptions father and mother nan not guessing what was going on in his heart took advantage of his silence twenty eight why are nt you married why in the world should i be he wanted to know green valley men are usually the fathers of two or three children at your age she informed him calmly oh he smiled frankly of course i shall marry some day but a man need never hurry he unlike a woman can always marry and i intend to have children many children because one child is always so lonely i know because i was an only child this astounding piece of confidence kept nan s tongue tied and for a few seconds all manner of funny emotions fought within her she wanted to laugh to get angry at the lordly superiority of the idea that a woman must hurry to the altar she felt that she ought to feel embarrassed but the innocent sincerity with which it was all uttered kept her from blushing and her eyes from snapping she told herself instead this boy from india was certainly the weirdest and she wondered what a woman not his mother could do with him after a while she tried again do nt you feel rather guilty loafing here in the sunshine no why what should i be doing these beautiful afternoons you ought to be devoting to pastoral calls but i attended to all the day s work this morning i helped uncle roger allan build a fence and doctored up david s pet horse dolly i spaded up a flower plot for grandma wentworth and visited little jimmy trumbull who s home from the hospital doc philipps says he wo nt be up for some time yet so to cheer him up i ve promised him a party i also drove to the station with mrs bates ancient horse and brought home her new incubator while i was there jocelyn brownlee came down to get a box she said she had there some teasing cousin sent her a little live pig she did nt know what to do so i put the pig beside the incubator and sat jocelyn beside me and we proceeded on our way that horse belonging to mrs bates is certainly a solemn stately beast but jocelyn s little pig was anything but stately we made an interesting and a musical spectacle as we went along and i know that one little red headed boy in this town was late for school because he followed us halfway home we passed the tomlins place and hen was sitting at the window propped up with pillows it was his first day up and we made him laugh so hard that his wife was a little worried i think agnes is rather good to hen these days is nt she nan ventured to ask for the whole town knew how agnes had gone to the minister with her domestic troubles and how in some mysterious fashion this young man had worked a miracle for both agnes and hen were as suddenly and happily in instead of being a middle aged and childless couple but that was all the town did know about the matter for strange to say agnes who had talked loud enough and long enough before about her unhappiness now was still with never a word to say about what made her so contented and happy green valley saw her look at hen as if he were suddenly precious and smooth his pillow and wait on him and green valley wanted to know all about it but so far nobody knew but agnes hen and the new minister and he did nt seem inclined to speak about it not even to satisfy nanny ainslee s curiosity once more nanny was embarrassed and a little angry she swung up her sunshade and started to go this minister man with his ignorance of women and his knowledge of hen s domestic affairs was
which we shall not need to blush and which will really be civilized did the saxon workmen have to make dresden china in germany yes works under the patronage of the emperor were opened at berlin and here porcelain was made the profits of which went to the royal treasury the workmen being paid very little indeed much of the ware manufactured the monarch kept for his own use and much of it he gave away whenever he wished to make a fine present to his friends but so lavishly did the saxon potters use the deposits of native clay that later the supply became poorer in quality and as a consequence the body of the later dresden was not so perfect as that made at meissen for this reason collectors set great value on the early dresden work the figures modeled by the sculptor kaendler did the works at berlin continue inquired theo who had become absorbed in the story yes replied mr croyden you see even before the capital at dresden was captured by the germans and the meissen workmen carried off attempts had been made in prussia to manufacture porcelain from ordinary stone several private business concerns as well as various individuals had put their money into the enterprise and had even met with some success but this ware was manufactured on no very extended scale now however the emperor was determined that his venture should succeed not only did he bring to berlin the workmen and the clay but he even sent forth the edict that no jew in his kingdom should marry until he had purchased an entire supply of porcelain from the royal factories as most of the jews were rich this law assured their master a wide sale for his product that they did not wish to spend all not at all most of these unlucky jews bought their expensive porcelain sets only to sell them afterward to other customers and thus get them off their hands in this way much of the early berlin dresden ware found its way into russia where rich russian jews were glad to buy it after repeated improvements the berlin porcelain came in time to be as fine as that made originally at meissen and not only were the meissen works reopened under german patronage but the state also established another factory at charlottenberg now do not forget theo that all this early meissen or dresden porcelain as well as that eventually manufactured at berlin was made from hard paste or a combination of clays resulting in what we call true porcelain later on i shall tell you much about soft paste wares and about bone china none of those varieties however ranks as real porcelain remember that only the hard paste products are genuine mr croyden paused a moment this period in history you may perhaps be interested to know that it was a workman who escaped from meissen into austria who started in vienna the art of making porcelain from hard paste true porcelain remarked theo who had profited by his lesson just so son work in porcelain making had been going on in austria since about but it had been done in a small way by private individuals who had only small capital to put into it and who had met with little success because the ware they had turned out had been thick and muddy in appearance in the empress maria theresa purchased these works and from that time on they began to prosper you see the monarchs of those days could make almost any industry a success if they once set out to do so not only had they the capital to back their undertaking but they could compel their subjects to patronize the venture theo laughed i see therefore busy place which was supplying with porcelain not only austria but also turkey in lamprecht one of the leading animal painters of the monarchy was decorating this ware with wonderful pictures of stags hounds horses in which work he excelled but because of the mohammedan law that no copies of living creatures could be used for designs the turks refused to purchase these dishes hence vienna eager to retain the oriental trade was forced to change its artistic trend and make instead porcelains adorned with arabesques and geometrical figures at the present time concluded mr croyden there are extensive pottery and porcelain factories throughout germany and austria hungary and much of our finest ware comes from these countries were you to study history you would find that many of these factories sprang up from small beginnings and that amid the turmoil of european strife they had a stiff fight for existence i think i never considered before the effect of war upon anything but persons remarked theo human life is bad enough answered mr croyden but see too how it retards the arts and industries of the world may the day be not far distant when nations shall find a more christian and intelligent method of settling their differences and when wars shall cease forevermore illustration chapter ix the romance of french china making the next day when mr croyden put his head in at theo s door to say good morning he found the boy sitting up in bed eating his breakfast and his first remark was how long did it take france to find out how to make porcelain mr croyden the manufacturer laughed i declare if you are not beginning this morning just where you left off last night he exclaimed what kind of porcelain do you mean hard or soft paste oh any kind you have not forgotten the vast difference between the hard and soft ware have you i should be discouraged if you do nt believe you would let me forget even if i wanted to he replied with an impish chuckle i certainly should nt smiled mr croyden then he added more seriously soft paste

thing was enough and too much one flight down so the party was practically over mr algernon leary of the firm of leary amp slack counsellors and attorneys at law with offices at number thirty two broad street was among the very last to depart never had mr leary spent a more pleasant evening he had been in rare form a variety of causes contributing to this happy state to begin with he had danced nearly every dance with the lovely miss milly hollister for whom he entertained the feelings which a gentleman of ripened judgment and one who was rising rapidly in his profession might properly entertain for an entirely charming young woman of reputed means and undoubted social position a preposterous ass named perkins at least mr leary mentally indexed perkins as a preposterous ass had brought miss hollister to the party but thereafter in the scheme of things perkins did not count he was a cipher you could back him up against a wall and take a rubber tipped pencil and rub him right out hollister that figuratively was what mr leary had done to mr perkins now on the other hand voris might have amounted to something as a potential rival but voris being newly appointed as a police magistrate was prevented by press of official duties from coming to the party so mr leary had had a clear field as the saying goes and had made the most of it as the other saying goes moreover mr leary had been the recipient of unlimited praise upon the ingenuity and the uniqueness expressed in his costume he had not represented a little lord fauntleroy or a buster brown or a boy scout or a juvenile cadet or a midshipmite or an oliver twist there had been three boy scouts present and four buster browns and of sailor suited persons there had been no end really but mr leary had chosen to appear as himself at the age of three and as the complimentary comment proved his get up had reflected credit not alone upon its wearer but upon its designer one of the women s magazines out of the goodness of her heart and the depths of her professional knowledge miss skiff had gone to mr leary s aid supervising the preparation of his wardrobe at a theatrical costumer s shop up town and on the evening before coming to his bachelor apartments accompanied by her mother personally to add those small special refinements which meant so much as he now realised in attaining the desired result oh mr leary i must tell you again how very fetching you do look your costume is adorable really it is so so cute and everything and i do nt know what i should have done without you to help in the games and everything there s no use denying it mr leary you were the life of the party absolutely at least twice during the night mrs carroway had told mr leary this and now as he bade her farewell she was saying it once more in practically the same touched him on the arm scuse me suh apologised blanche but the hall man downstairs he send up word jes now by the elevator man at you d best be comin right on down now suh effen you expects to git a taxicab he say to tell you they ai nt but one taxicab left an the driver of at one s been waitin fur hours an he act like he might go way any minute now at s whut the hall man send word suh blanche had brought his overcoat along and held it up for him imparting to the service that small suggestion of a ceremonial rite which the members of her race invariably do display when handling a garment of richness of texture and indubitable cost mr leary let her help him into the coat and slipped largess into her hand and as he stepped aboard the waiting elevator for the downward flight mrs carroway s voice came fluting to him surely were the life of the party ii it was fine to have been the life of the party it was not quite so fine to discover that the taxicab to which he must entrust himself for the long ride up to west eighty fifth street was a most shabby appearing vehicle the driver of which moreover as mr leary could divine even as he crossed the sidewalk had wiled away the tedium of waiting by indulgence in draughts of something more potent than the chill air of latish november mr leary peered doubtfully into the illuminated countenance but dulled eyes of the driver and caught a whiff of a breath alcoholically fragrant and he understood that the warning relayed to him by blanche had carried a subtle double meaning still there was no other taxicab to be had the street might have been a byway in old pompeii for all the life that moved within it washington square facing him was as empty as a graveyard generally is at this hour and the semblance of a snow the first of the season sifting down in large damp flakes twice and thrice he repeated the address speaking each time sharply and distinctly before the meaning seemed to filter into the befogged intellect of the inebriate on the third rendition the latter roused from where he was slumped down i garcia steve he said thickly i garcia firs time only y hollowed s loud i couldn und stancher so saying he lurched into a semiupright posture and fumbled for the wheel silently condemning the curse of intemperance among the working classes of a great city mr leary boarded the cab and drew the skirts of his overcoat down in an effort to cover his knees with a harsh grating of clutches and an abrupt jerk the taxi started north wobbling though he was upon his
s some more pennies be careful this time he warned him and from his sack he drew forth another great handful of gold pennies how they did shine but as marmaduke reached icicle whip and again they rolled over the edge of the moon and again marmaduke was too eager he ran after them and wienerwurst ran too and when they reached the edge they could nt stop themselves at all they were falling down down through the sky a hundred somersaults they turned marmaduke tried to hold on to a cloud but his hands went right through it he tried to hold on to the stars but he missed every one then suddenly bang went his head against the church steeple and all the stars danced then he woke he looked around why he was sitting up in the bed his very own bed by the red fire it was just a trick of the dream fairy s after all but it was all right for at the foot of the bed rested the just as still as still could be and at the side of the bed stood father and mother and the toyman they seemed very happy sixteenth night sloshin of course marmaduke grew well again and back from uncle roger s came jehosophat and hepzebiah they came back in the old creaking buckboard with methuselah the old old white horse and the toyman no sooner had they jumped to the ground than marmaduke asked very proudly where do you think i ve been you ve been sick marmaduke shook his head that s not what i mean he said i ve been to see the old man in the moon now you re telling stories jeered jehosophat you ve just been in bed all the time i m not telling any stories said his brother stoutly i tell you i have been to visit the old man in the moon but jehosophat would nt believe him that s his friend the toyman i have been there have nt i where said the toyman to see the old man in the moon of course you have his good old chum replied and a heap of wonderful things you saw the toyman never laughed at the wonderful things they had done nor at the marvellous things they had seen no never for he understood little children now jehosophat had to believe him he asked lots of questions while hepzebiah listened her eyes growing as round as big peppermint drops so marmaduke showed them the little red and blue sleigh and told them all about the little driver jack frost and he did nt forget about old black eyed susan s great jump nor the gold pennies either jehosophat felt just a little jealous perhaps that is why he was naughty that day and this is how it all happened it was in the afternoon jehosophat was coming home from mile a long way from the toolong where the three happy children lived with him walked four of his friends sophy soapstone and sammy soapstone who lived on the farm by the old canal lizzie fizzletree who lived on the turnpike and fatty hamm who lived by the river road sammy soapstone had blue eyes and tow hair which stood up straight on his head it was as stiff as the curry comb with which the toyman brushed the horses sophy soapstone had blue eyes too and two neat little pigtails down her back but lizzie fizzletree had black eyes and hair that stuck out in all directions she had more safety pins on her dress than a neat little girl should ever have and her stockings were forever coming down fatty hamm was so round and so plump that he looked as if he had pillows under his clothes and though he was only twelve he had two chins every once in a while he would eat so much that a button would pop two three four five he ate he did not offer one to his friends not even the core another apple he took that made six pop went a button and splash it landed in a puddle of brown water for three days it had rained washing the white snow away the ruts in the road were full of these puddles nice and brown and inviting sammy s eyes and jehosophat s eyes followed the button as it landed in the water making little rings which grew larger all the time let s slosh said sammy let s cried lizzie fizzletree it s lots of fun sloshin into a big puddle marched sammy soapstone and after him marched lizzie and sophy and at the end of the procession waddled fatty slop slosh slop slosh they went through puddle after puddle glorious fun it was showers of spray flew all over the road but had nt his mother told him particularly not to get his feet wet come on in it s fine they all shouted at jehosophat aw come on sammy soapstone repeated and fatty called fraidcat at that jehosophat turned around he just could nt stand being called fraidcat so slosh slosh into the biggest brown puddle he could find he went slosh slop slop slosh over his rubber tops went the water fine and cool it felt splash went the water over the road and he kicked it over fatty till the round fat legs were drenched too then all the boys bent over the puddle and scooped up great handfuls of water and threw them over each other it was a great battle and when it was finished and they were soaked to the skin they splashed up the road shouting and singing i guess they went into every side of the road they had reached it now all of a sudden jehosophat felt very funny near the pit of his stomach something was sure to happen now in front of the
of his car he recognized her as the weld girl s matter in the ditch she s hurt quick whose car chug was scrambling down the banks hatton s angie hatton s gosh over by the fence where she had been flung angie hatton was found sitting up dizzily and saying betty betty in what a whisper i m all right dear i m all right oh angie are you she was cut and bruised and her wrist had been broken the two girls clung to each other wordlessly the thing was miraculous in view of the car that lay perilously tipped on its fender you re a lucky bunch said chug who was driving i was said angie hatton it was nt her fault the weld girl put in quickly we were coming from winnebago she s a wonderful driver we met a farm wagon coming toward us one of those big ones the middle of the road perhaps he was asleep he did nt turn out we thought he would of course at the last minute we had to try for the ditch it was too steep anyway you re nervy kids both of you i ll have to leave five thousand dollars worth of car in the road till morning it ll be all right he did get them home in twenty minutes and the five thousand dollars worth of car was still lying repentantly in the ditch when morning came old man hatton himself came into the garage to thank chug the following day chug met him in overalls smudge faced as he was old man hatton put out his hand chug grinned and looked at his own grease grimed paw that s all right said old man hatton and grasped it firmly want to thank you that s all right said chug did nt do a thing no business driving alone that hour of the night girls nowadays he looked around the garage work here i suppose yessir if there s anything i can do for you over at the mill guess not said fine let s see who owns this place i do old man hatton s face broke into a sunburst of laugh wrinkles he threw back his head and went the scale from roar to chuckle one on me pretty good have to tell angie that one chug walked to the street with him your daughter she s got a lot of nerve all right and that girl with her weld say not a whimper out of her and the blood running down her face she all right cut her head a little they re both all right angie would nt even stay in bed well as i say if there s anything chug flushed a little tell you what mr hatton i m working on a thing that ll take the whine out of the daker old man hatton owned the daker motor plant among other things the daker not much for looks but everything in the engine and everyone who has ever owned one knows that its only fault is the way its engine moans daker owners hate that moan when you re going right it sounds a pass between a peanut roaster and a banshee with bronchitis every engineer in the daker plant had worked over it ca nt be done said old man hatton another three months and i ll show you hope you do son hope you do but in another three months chug scaritt was one of a million boys destined to take off a pink striped shirt a nobby belted suit and a long visored cap to don a rather bob tailed brown outfit it was some eighteen months later before he resumed the chromatic clothes with an ardour out of all proportion to their style and cut but in the interval between doffing pink striped shirt and donning pink striped shirt no need to describe camp sibley two miles outside chippewa and the city no going into detail concerning the effective combination formed by chug and a machine gun these things were important and interesting but perhaps not more interesting than the seemingly unimportant fact that in july following that april chug was dancing blithely and rhythmically with elizabeth weld and saying angie hatton s a smooth little dancer all right but she is nt in it with you for chippewa somehow had fused chippewa had forgotten sets sections cliques factions and parties and formed a community it had figuratively wiped out the railroad tracks together with all artificial social boundaries chug scaritt in uniform must be kept happy he must be furnished with wholesome recreation fun amusement entertainment there sprang up seemingly overnight a great wooden hall in elm street on what had been a vacant lot and there by day or by night were to be had music and dancing and hot cakes and girls girls girls who were straight and slim and young and bright eyed and companionable girls like angie hatton girls like betty weld betty weld who no longer sat against the wall at the golf club dances and prayed in her heart that fat old oakley was nt coming to ask her to dance betty weld was so popular now that the hostess used to have to say to her in a tactful aside my dear you ve danced three times this evening with the scaritt boy you know that s against the rules betty knew it so did chug betty danced so lightly that chug could hardly feel her in his arms he told her that she ran sweet and true like the engine of a high powered car and with as little apparent effort she liked that and understood it was wonderful how she understood chug had never known that girls could understand like that she talked to you straight looked at interested you no waist squeezing here no cheap banter you even forgot she wore

that any one else should have been in the vicinity without lem s knowledge it was quite possible that lem s statement of the hour when he was shot was incorrect for his mind could hardly yet be clear enough to be certain without doubt of details lem quickly dropped into a refreshing sleep and doctor joe left him for a little while to join the boys out of doors he found them behind the house picking the goose indian jake had left in the tree at the flat point camp how s lem sir is he hurt bad david asked as doctor joe seated himself upon a stump he s sleeping now after he rests a little we ll see how badly he s hurt said about dinner hungry already i ll be bound aye grinned david wonderful hungry t is most noon sir doctor joe consulted his watch i declare it is it must have been nearly eleven o clock when we reached here i did nt realize it was so late t were ten minutes to eleven sir said andy i were lookin to see how long it takes us to come from flat p int what time did we leave flat point asked doctor joe t were twenty minutes before seven sir andy drew his new watch proudly from his pocket to refer to it again as he did upon every possible occasion no corrected david t were only twenty five minutes before eleven when we leaves flat p int and fifteen minutes before eleven when we gets here i looks to see perhaps your watches suppose we compare them the comparison disclosed a difference as doctor joe predicted of five minutes then each must needs set his watch with doctor joe s which was a little slower than andy s and a little faster than david s doctor joe made some mental calculations both david and andy had observed their watches and there could be no doubt of the length of time it had required them to come from flat point to lem s cabin they had consumed four hours but their progress had been exceedingly slow indian jake had doubtless travelled much faster in his light canoe but at best with the wind against him he could hardly have paddled from lem s cabin to flat point in less than two hours he had arrived one hour after sunset if lem were correct as to the time when the shooting took place indian jake could not be guilty but still there was with but one hour or possibly a little more in excess at camp an uncertain alibi for indian jake lem may have been shot much earlier in the afternoon than he supposed when lem grew stronger it would be necessary to question him closely that the hour might be fixed with certainty whoever had shot and robbed lem must have known of the existence of the silver fox skin and been familiar with the surroundings the shots had doubtless been fired through a broken pane in a window directly behind the chair in which lem was sitting at the time why not cook dinner out here over an open fire doctor joe presently suggested you chaps are pretty noisy and if you come into the house to cook it on the stove i m afraid you ll wake lem up and i want him to sleep we ll cook un out here sir david agreed t is more fun to cook here jamie suggested very well when it s ready you may bring lem will probably be awake by that time and he ll want something too stew the goose so that there ll be broth and we ll give some of it to lem to drink you ll have to go to fort pelican without me i ll have to stay here and take care of lem if the wind comes up and i think it will you may get a start after dinner and doctor joe returned to the cabin to watch over his patient the goose was plucked david split a stick of wood and with his jack knife whittled shavings for the fire the knife had a keen edge for david was a born woodsman and every woodsman keeps his tools always in good condition and the shavings he cut were long and thin he did not cut each shaving separately but stopped his knife just short of the end of the stick and when several shavings were cut with a twist of the blade he broke them from the main stick the butt to which they were attached he whittled four or five of these bunches of shavings and then cut some fine splints with his axe david was now ready to light his fire he placed two sticks of wood upon the ground end to end in the form of a right angle with the opening between the sticks in the direction from which the wind came taking the butt of one of the bunches of shavings in his left hand he scratched a match with his right hand and lighted the thin end of the shavings when they were blazing freely he carefully placed the thick end upon the two sticks where they came together on the inside of the angle with the burning end resting upon the ground thus the thick end of the shavings was elevated fire always climbs upward and in an instant the whole bunch of shavings was ablaze upon this he placed the other shavings the thin ends on the fire the butts resting upon the two had previously prepared arranged upon this they quickly ignited and upon them larger sticks were laid and in less than five minutes an excellent cooking fire was ready for the pot before disjointing the goose david held it over the blaze until it was thoroughly singed and the surface of the skin clear
water and her breathing was distinctly perceptible sara could hear it too and it sounded like the ghost of a dead breeze in a pine top as soon as sara could take her ravished eyes from the sight she looked down to see what was nuzzling about her shoe buttons and just as she had suspected it was the snoodle frisking and tumbling and rolling about her feet to make her notice him and indeed when he was awake the snoodle was irresistible not that he looked like anything sara had ever seen before he might perhaps have looked like a dog indeed gave him a haunting resemblance to a freshly cooked piece of macaroni sara was later to find out the reason for this but at the moment she was puzzled just as you are when you meet a stranger who looks like somebody else and you ca nt remember who else it is and his head which was not very clearly defined was finished off with a neat little cap that looked like a snail shell and seemed to be fastened to him his eyes which stuck out several inches in front of his face on long prongs were delightfully mischievous and confiding and he was covered with the most beautiful snow white curly hair but he had one drawback and sara discovered that when she started to pick him up it was a sort of little window in the exact middle of his back with an ising glass cover like the slide cover of some boxes the minute you touched him this little slide drew back and from within there was distinctly perceptible sara could even smell it as soon as she did so she herself drew back and contented herself with looking admiringly at the confiding playful little snoodle as she stood watching his pretty antics she became aware that the snimmy s wife had stopped her work and was watching them with a grim smile sara saw that she had just unscrewed the knob of the prose bush and was still holding the doorknob and the corkscrew in her hand as far as sara could tell the doorknob seemed as neatly hemmed as ever so overcome by curiosity she asked the snimmy s wife what she was going to do with it this is the day to unhem it she answered rather glumly i unhem it every pinkday and hem it every lilyday i used to hem it only oncet a month but avrillia said that was nt civilized and whatever she says goes at least she added glancing up at fountain she thinks so and as long as i live neighbor to her it s sort of up to me to respect her standards avrillia ah now sara remembered she had meant to go straight to find pirlaps and avrillia she glanced around to see if she could find the curly little path but she could not really start until she had asked a few questions about the darling little snoodle is is nt he lovely she began aware of a vague necessity of pleasing the wife of the snimmy if one wanted to find out anything however she was quite honest she really did think the snoodle was lovely except for his drawback you think so answered the snimmy s wife trying hard not to show how foolishly pleased she really was he s the only child we have if sara had thought a minute she would not have asked the next question certainly not of so formidable a person as the snimmy s wife eagerly is he a a sort of dog a sort of dog echoed the snimmy s wife in the most outraged italics a kind of puppy a kind of puppy said the snimmy s wife in perfectly withering small capitals then she said in the loftiest large capitals sara had ever seen his mother was a snail she held the world s record for slowness and his father was a pedigreed noodle sara looked at him in awe now she understood the cap and the prongs and the extreme length but in spite of the snimmy s wife s indignant mood she had to ask one more question but you said he was your child was the way she put it i did nt retorted the snimmy s wife with undisguised contempt i said he was the only child we have we have him have nt we and with that she sat and curled her long white tail around the base with quite unnecessary tightness her nose was not quite so debilitating as the snimmy s still it nearly stuck into the doorknob as she hemmed sara saw there was nothing further to be got out of her and she did not wish to pick up the snoodle on account of his drawback so she decided to go on to avrillia s without further delay and began to look around her again for the little curly path it was pink this time instead of curly but that made it all the more attractive so she struck into it at once and went skipping happily toward the arch in the hawthorn hedge just before she reached it she heard avrillia s thermometer go off so she knew that she was on the right path the minute she got through the hedge she saw avrillia and oh loveliest of wonders what were those flying around her hair clinging to her silken skirts playing a dainty game up and down the marble stairs oh it was the children the children were at home and when avrillia saw sara she came toward her with the loveliest look of welcome the children hanging all around her like rose garlands and if sara had loved avrillia the day before she could simply find no words now to express her adoration for avrillia knelt down among the shell flowers and held out her arms which
permission to go up and stay at temple camp before the season opens and fell some of those trees on the new woods property and put up three cabins on the hill for roy and the troop to use when they get there i would nt want anybody to know i m doing it what said mr burton i want to go up there and stay and put up three cabins said tom dully humph said mr burton sitting back and surveying him with amused and frank surprise how about the difficulties that s the only thing tom said i was thinking it all over and the only difficulty i can think about is would margaret keep it a secret until the work is done and you too they think i m not a scout any more and i m going to show them if you think i ca nt do it you ask pete the janitor and if i see the hard part is really your part keeping still and making her keep still i see said mr burton contemplating the stolid almost expressionless face of tom and trying not to laugh outright my part is easy said tom chapter xv a letter from barnard when tom reached temple camp he found a letter awaiting him there it was stuck up among the antlers of uncle jeb s moose head which hung in the old camp manager s cabin he found uncle jeb alone in his glory and mighty glad to see him it was characteristic of the old western scout and trapper whom mr temple had brought from arizona that he was never surprised at anything if a grizzly bear had wandered into camp it would not have ruffled him in the least he would have surveyed it with calm shrewd deliberation taken his corncob pipe out of his mouth knocked the ashes out of it and proceeded to business if the grizzly bear safety first he would have withdrawn immediately upon the ominous sound of old uncle jeb s pipe knocking against the nearest hard substance uncle jeb like uncle sam moved slowly but very surely it was not altogether uncommon for some nature loving pilgrim to drop in at camp out of season and such a one was always sure of that easy going western welcome but if all the kings and emperors in the world or such few of them as are left had dropped in at camp uncle jeb rushmore would have eyed them keenly puffed some awful smoke at them and said haow doo he liked people but he did not depend on them the lake and the trees and the wild life talked to him and as for human beings he was always glad of their company it was also characteristic of uncle jeb that no adventurous enterprise no foolhardy daredevil scheme ever caused him any astonishment mr burton engrossed in a hundred at tom s plan and let him go to temple camp to discover its absurdity and then benefit by the quiet life and fresh air it would have been better if tom had been sent up there long before he had humored him by promising not to tell and he was glad that this crazy notion about the cabins had given tom the incentive to go he had believed that tom s unfortunate error could be made right by the romantic expedient of a postage stamp mr burton was not a scout and tom slade was the queerest of all scouts so now uncle jeb removed his pipe from his mouth and said reckoned you d make a trip up hey i m going to stay here alone with you until the season opens tom said i got shell shocked i ai nt any good down there i assigned our three cabins to a troop in ohio so i got to build three more and have em ready on the hill yer ai nt cal latin on trimming yer timbers much are yer uncle jeb asked going straight to the practical aspects of tom s plan i m going to put them up just like the temporary cabins were when the camp first opened tom said ye ll find some of them same logs under the pavilion uncle jeb said enough for two cabins mebbe why doa nt you put up four and let that peewee kid hev one all by hisself do you think i can do it in six weeks tom asked i ve seed a injun stockade throwed up in three days uncle jeb answered me n general custer throwed up fort bendy in two nights that wuz in montanny th injuns thought we wuz gods from heaven but we wuz nt no gods as i told the general leastways i was n n never wuz but i had a sharp axe tom said but i wanted it to be a stunt as you might say tai nt no stunt uncle jeb said who s writin yer from out in ohio i see the postmark tai nt them kids from out dayton way i hope tom opened the letter and read aloud dear tom when i save a fellow s life i claim the right to call him by his first name even if i ve never seen him if anybody ever tells me again that the world is a big place i ll tell them it s about the size of a shell hole no bigger and that s small enough as you and i know all i can say is well well and you re the same thomas slade and the funny part of it is we would nt know each other if we met in the street that s because we met in a shell hole made inquiries in the hospital at rheims and tried to get a line on you from the red cross and y m c a nothing doing somebody
to be it is for the benefit of their more and more deserving nation but it is first and foremost for himself and his family he has a burning itching desire to reign everywhere he is not a normal man physically and is unbalanced by a monumental toolong when your frau is so busily sewing she is sewing for her household it is true but she is consciously and unconsciously sewing for wilhelm when your fraeulein goes out to her etching lesson she is aware of being of the magnificent german people and shares a part of the national ambition to excel it s this that we have nt got in america and ca nt well have under our system but it s this unified disciplined zeal that enables two or three ordinary germans to do what it takes four ordinary yankees to do clad in armor and with a glistening sword in hand germania ought to scare but kirtley it scares me i feel see something awful coming in the universal german hate the national boundary stops any flow outward of sympathy good faith equity all peoples outside are human insects whom it is proper for the teuton to tread on if he can crush the life out of because they are in his pathway to glory kirtley who had stared at his new friend in this solemnity turned a serious face toward the clawlike branches of his linden in its gauntness of late autumn tide this meaning of the animus that was impelling his odd and yet so normal german household he began to see was substantiated by a score of acts and attitudes in its daily life he scarcely deemed it proper to tell of them besides he did not want to fire up anderson who already was so unsettled so comfortless on the subject but kirtley was reasoning out how this animus gave a solidity a solidarity to the german household a satisfied any such incentive was almost absent in the american family and so wound up anderson with epigrams the years will be left humanity to weep these days of insouciance and neglect you can see that germany is a man made nation it is not the kind god or nature would make god must have turned his face when the teuton species was manufactured germany is like a man made hot air register when it is nt throwing up hot air it is throwing up cold air it is always throwing up to change the somewhat painful theme kirtley soon began i do nt see any sports such as we know them in germany how do they get along without them like all yankee college men he was alert on these lines no sports in deutschland go out on the dresden golf links of a morning and you ll find hardly a german soul playing it s the same in vienna the same in berlin they have links because it s go out on the highway to berlin or vienna or any of the great roads and you will seldom meet any germans touring in their motors for pleasure only americans english the germans are spoiling little time by such matters they are busy busy working for their empire busy like moles boring away to undermine the earth busy drilling with arms so you see no sporting terms incorporated in their daily language in their newspaper language such as we see in england and america terms denoting fair play square deal manly courtesy toward the under dog our anglo saxon motto do nt hit him when he s down is no motto with the germans they think that s just the time to hit him kick him when he s flattened out kick him preferably in the face that s one reason so many teutons have scarred faces the anglo saxon spirit in a sporting crowd is for the little fellow in germany it s for the big fellow the fellow who already has everything on his side the true idea and fun of sport take away its knightliness of bearing spirit of self sacrifice exhibition of pluck though defeat is certain and what have you left to sport about it merely becomes a question of brute force overwhelming force you have cruelty left as a net result and that s a large part of german conduct cruelty to underlings or to those who are feebler or caught at an unfair disadvantage having no leaven of sports is one thing that makes the german life seem so heavy ominous brutal to us its growling rigidity with all this anderson continued gravely is due to the fact that the old men are mainly in the saddle in germany men sixty and seventy the existence and influence of young men are not as much in command as with us these old germans have disgruntled stomachs from so much drinking and they roar about physical sports mean nothing to them and so it seems sometimes as if the germans are born old helps make them such a serious race the most serious and yet people insist on believing that this serious race means nothing but fun by all its military preparations where s the logic when the journalist went kirtley let him through the wall gate with its weighted rope the gate flew back in place with a loud report as if to give emphasis to the old man s direful interpretations and prophecies chapter xii habits and children in spite of anderson gard could not make up his mind that rudolph was anything more than a young braggadocio the idea of an ordinary family living comfortably along with a spy in its midst ready to inform on them and their guests was so foreign to his notions so caddish that it weakened his confidence in his compatriot s judgment while gard felt that rudi was not straight he could not consider him downright harmful however under
little flags on them and trying hard to invent to the last detail a successful campaign bazaine advancing on berlin frossard penetrating bavaria and mac mahon reaching the baltic to work this all out she needed help and i helped her as much as i could but the one who helped her most was her grandfather himself he had conquered germany so many times during the first empire he knew every move this will be the enemy s next move here he would say and ours will be this his anticipations were always justified by the event which made him not a little proud unhappily no matter how fast we took cities and won battles we never went fast enough for him the old fellow was insatiable each new success doctor we have taken mayence said the little girl coming to meet me with a smile that went to your heart and through the door i heard his glad salutation we re getting on in another week we shall be in berlin at that time the prussians were only a week s march from paris at first we wondered whether we had not better carry our patient into the country then we reflected that as soon as he was taken out of the house he would learn the true state of affairs and i decided that he was still too feeble too stunned by his stroke to let him find out the truth so we decided to stay where we were the first day of the prussian occupation i climbed the stairs to his apartment i remember with a heavy heart at the thought of all the closed doors of paris and the fighting going on under her walls in the suburbs which were now up in bed jubilant and proud well he said the siege has begun i looked at him in amazement so you know now colonel his grandchild turned to me why yes doctor that is the great news to day the siege of berlin has begun and while she spoke she went on with her sewing as calmly as you please how could he suspect what was happening he could nt hear the guns at the fortifications he could nt see the city in its fear and sorrow from his bed he could see one side of the arc de triomphe and his room was filled with odds and ends of the period of the first empire all admirably fitted to sustain his illusions portraits of napoleon s marshals battle prints a picture of the little king of rome in his baby dress big stiff consoles decorated with trophies covered with imperial relics medallions bronzes a piece of the all representing the same blue eyed lady now with hair curled now in a ball dress now in a yellow gown with leg of mutton sleeves and all this consoles king of rome marshals yellow gowned short waisted ladies with that prim stiffness which was considered graceful in this atmosphere of victory and conquest it was this more than anything we could say to him that made him accept so naively the siege of berlin after that day our military operations grew simpler and simpler nothing but a little patience was needed in order to take berlin every little while when the old gentleman grew listless we read him a letter from his son an imaginary letter of course as paris was by now cut off and as since sedan the aide de camp of mac mahon had been sent to a german fortress you can easily imagine the despair of the poor child who heard nothing from her father knowing that he was a prisoner deprived of even comfort and perhaps sick while she of joy brief indeed such as a soldier would write from the field a soldier advancing day by day through the enemy s country sometimes it was too much for her and weeks went by without a letter the old man began to worry and to be unable to sleep then presto a letter from germany would arrive and she would read it gayly at her grandfather s bedside holding back her tears the old colonel would listen gravely smile knowingly approve criticize and explain to us any passage which seemed confused but it was in the replies that he made to his son that he was magnificent never forget that you are french he wrote be generous to the poor germans do nt let them suffer more than is inevitable from the invasion of their country and then came suggestions without end charming moralizing on property rights the courtesy due to women a veritable code of honor for conquerors all the peace terms on this last point he was not unduly exacting indemnity and nothing more what good would their provinces be to us a france could never be made out of a germany he dictated that in a firm voice and one could not hear him without emotion there was so much sincerity so beautiful a patriotism in what he said meanwhile the siege was progressing not the siege of berlin unfortunately we had reached the period of severe cold the bombardment the epidemics the famine but thanks to our efforts to the infinite tenderness which enfolded him the serenity of the old old man was never troubled to the end i was able to get white bread and fresh meat for him for him alone of course you ca nt imagine anything more touching than these luncheons so innocent in their egotism the old gentleman sitting up in bed fresh and smiling his napkin tucked under his chin and his pale little granddaughter at hand to him as he ate all these forbidden good things then animated by his meal in the comfort of his warm room while the winter s wind whistled outside and the snow flakes whirled around the windows the ex cuirassier told us for the
want peter whatever his morals to think that we ate our food raw off the bone and made fire by rubbing sticks together yet he must have come pretty close to believing that unimpeachable as his manners remained for whinnie had burned the roast of veal to a charry mass the twins were crying of the dining room table with worcestershire sauce i showed peter where he could wash up and where he could find a whisk to remove the dried mud from his person then i hurriedly appeased my complaining bairns opened a can of beans to take the place of whinnie s boiled potatoes which most unmistakably tasted of yellow soap and supplemented what looked dishearteningly like a dixon dinner with my last carefully treasured jar of raspberry preserve whinstane sandy it is true remained as glum and silent as a glacier through all that meal but my new man peter talked easily and uninterruptedly and he talked amazingly well he talked about mountain goats and the morgan rose jars in the metropolitan and why he disliked george moore and the difference between english and american slang and why english women always wear the wrong sort of hats and the poetry in indian names if we only had the brains to understand em and how the wheat i d manufactured my home made bread out of and how the alcohol and carbonic acid gas of the fermented yeast affected the gluten and how the woman who could make bread like that ought to have a specially designed decoration pinned on her apron front then he played paddy cake paddy cake baker s man with dinkie who took to him at once and when i came back from getting the extra cot ready in the bunk house my infant prodigy was on the new hired man s back circling the dinner table and shouting gid dap ossie gid dap as he went a proceeding which left the seamed old face of whinstane sandy about as blithe as a coffin lid so i coldly informed the newcomer that i d show him where he could put his things if he had any before we went out to look over the windmill and peter rather astonished me by lugging back from the motor car so discreetly left in the rear a huge suit case of pliable pigskin that looked like a steamer trunk with carrying handles attached to it like a norfolk jacket a chamois lined ulster a couple of plaid woolen rugs and a lunch kit in a neatly embossed leather case quite a bit of loot is nt it he said a little red in the face from the effort of portaging so pretentious a load that word loot stuck in my craw it was a painful reminder of something that i d been trying very hard to forget did it come with the car i demanded yes it came with the car he was compelled to acknowledge but it would be exhausting do nt you see to have to tunnel through a hay stack every time i wanted a hair brush i icily agreed that it would scenting tacit reproof in that mildly put observation of his but i did nt propose to be trifled with i calmly led mr peter ketley out to where the overturned windmill tower lay like a museum skeleton along its bed of weeds and asked him simple question predicating a simple answer yet he did nt seem able to reply to it he scratched his close clipped pate and said he d have to look things over and study it out windmills were tricky things one kind demanding this sort of treatment and another kind demanding that you ll have no trouble of course in raising the tower i asked looking him square in the eye more than once i d seen these windmill towers of galvanized steel girders put up on the prairie and i had a very good idea of how the thing was done they were assembled lying on the ground and then a heavy plank was bolted to the bottom side of the tower base this plank was held in place by two big stakes then a block and tackle was attached to the upper part of the tower with the running rope looped over a tripod of poles to act as a fulcrum so that when a team of horses was attached to rose in the air steadied by a couple of guy ropes held out at right angles to it oh no trouble at all replied the expert quite airily but i noticed that his eye held an especially abstracted and preoccupied expression just how is it done i innocently inquired well that all depends he sapiently observed then apparently nettled by my obviously superior smile he straightened up and said i want you to leave this entirely to me it s my problem and you ve no right to be worried over it it ll take study of course and it ll take time rome was nt built in a day but before i leave you madam your tower will be up i hope you re not giving yourself a life sentence i remarked as i turned and left him i knew that he was looking after me as i went but i gave no outer of his movements through the shack window when he possessed himself of a hay fork and with more than one backward look over his shoulder circled out to where his car still stood he tooled it still closer up beside the hay stack which he mounted and then calmly and cold bloodedly buried under a huge mound of sun cured prairie grass that relic of a past crime which he seemed only too willing to obliterate but he was callous i could see for once that telltale car was out of sight he appeared much more interested in the
was slow to kindle he put a curb now on even his naturally deliberate vehicle of wrath looking the man through his shallow eyes down to the roots of his mean soul you re to take off our hats when we see a fence hargus said looking meaner with every breath you ve got it right pardner lambert calmly replied duke of chimney butte well pardner i m the king of hotfoot valley and i ve got travelin papers for you right here you seem to be a little sudden about it lambert said a lazy drawl to his words that inflamed hargus like a blow not half as sudden as you ll be kid this country ai nt no place for you young feller you re too fresh to keep in this hot climate and the longer you stay the hotter it gits i ll give you just two days to make your gitaway in consider the two days up said lambert with such calm and such coolness of head that men who heard him felt a thrill of admiration this ai nt no joke hargus as far as it concerns me i m just as far from this country right now as i ll be in two days or maybe two years consider your limit up it was so still in the barroom that one could have heard a match burn lambert had drawn himself up stiff and straight before hargus and stood facing him with defiance in every line of his stern strong face i ve give you your rope hargus said feeling that he had been called to show his hand in an open manner that was not his style and playing for a footing to save his face if you ai nt gone in two days you ll settle with me that goes with me hargus it s your move lambert turned contempt in his courageous bearing and walked out of the place scorning to throw a glance behind to see whether hargus came after him or whether he laid hand to his weapon in the xv wolves of the range lambert left his horse at the saloon hitching rack while he went to the store business was brisk in that place also requiring a wait of half an hour before his turn came in a short time thereafter he completed his purchases tied his package to his saddle and was ready to go home the sound of revelry was going forward again in the saloon the mechanical banjo plugging away on its tiresome tune there was a gap here and there at the rack where horses had been taken away but most of them seemed to be anchored there for the night standing dejectedly with drooping heads the tinkle of alta s guitar sounded through the open window of the hotel parlor as he passed indicating that taterleg was still in that harbor it would be selfish to call him making the most as he was of a clear field lambert smiled as he recalled the three cornered rivalry for alta s bony hand there was a lemon rind slice of new the huddling sage clumps at the roadside blotches of deepest shadow lambert ruminated on the trouble that had been laid out for him that night as he rode away from town going slowly in no hurry to put walls between him and the soft pleasant night he was confronted by the disadvantage of an unsought notoriety or reputation or whatever his local fame might be called a man with a fighting name must live up to it however distasteful the strife and turmoil or move beyond the circle of his fame move he would not could not although it seemed a foolish thing on reflection to hang on there in the lure of grace kerr s dark eyes what could a man reasonably expect of a girl with such people as sim hargus as her daily associates surely she had been schooled in their warped view of justice as her act that day proved no matter for omaha and its refinements she must be a savage under the skin for her a feeling of romantic sympathy that had been groping out to find her as a plant in a pit strains toward the light now in the sunshine of her presence would it flourish and grow green or wither in its mistaken worship and die vesta had warned him not knowing anything of the peculiar circumstances which brought him to that place or of his discovery which seemed a revelation of fate the conjunction of events shaped before his entry upon the stage indeed she had warned him but in the face of things as they had taken place what would it avail a man to turn his back on the arrangements of destiny as it was written so it must be lived it was not in his hand or his heart to change it turning these things in his mind flavoring the bitter in the prospect with the sweet of romance he was drawn out of his wanderings by the sudden starting of his horse it was not a leap out of laxity into alertness with a lifting of the head a fixing of the ears as if on some object ahead of which it was at once curious and afraid lambert was all tension in a breath ahead a little way the road branched at the point of the hill leading to the philbrook house his road lay to the right of the jutting plowshare of hill which seemed shaped for the mere purpose of splitting the highway the other branch led to kerr s ranch and beyond the horse was plainly scenting something in this latter branch of the road still hidden by the bushes which grew as tall there as the head of a man on horseback as the horse trotted on lambert made out something lying in
know you ll see little girl what would you say if i showed you a real bank account i would nt waste time talking i d marry you her good humour was returning honest gay do you think you might draw down some kale trust in any one who was paying her attention with a different type of man trudy would have been beaten courageously had the gentleman arrested and then interfered when the judge was directing him to the penitentiary i wish you would nt talk that way when we are married and you meet my friends you ll have to brush up on a lot of things i guess i ll manage to be understood she retorted and when we are married maybe you can get my job so as to support your wife the orchestra began playing a new rag and trudy and gay immediately left their chairs to be the first couple on the floor they were prouder of their dancing than of each other after several dances they became optimistic over the future and finished their dinner with the understanding that at the first possible moment they would be married and trudy was to be a hard working little bride causing her husband s men friends to be nice to the vondeplosshes to his wife they decided too that mary faithful was clever and good but queer that steve o valley would discover that a self made man could not marry an heiress and make a go of it as well as a man of an aristocratic family could marry an adorable red haired young lady and elevate her to his position that trudy was far more beautiful than beatrice constantine and as one lived only once in this world why not always strive for a good time whereat they had a farewell dance and moved on to the moving picture world where they held hands and stared vapidly at the films repairing to a cafeteria on a side street for a lunch and then to the faithful parlour mary had gone to church luke had boy friends in to discuss a summer camp and his mother snored mildly on the dining room sofa they took possession of the front parlour and the enlarged crayons of the faithful ancestors bore witness that for more than two hours these young people giggled life of the movie stars tried new dance steps and then planned how to get everything for nothing and having done so not to share their spoils a perfectly lovely time trudy said glibly as she kissed gay good night perfectly lovely he echoed politely do nt work too hard to morrow babseley will you and do nothing rash until you see me call me up to morrow at eight bubseley she giggled the pet names were of gay s choice so bubseley tottered down the walk while babseley turned out the lights and retired to her room with a bag of candy and a paprika brand of novel at midnight she tossed it aside and with self pity prepared to go to sleep and i ll have to go to work to morrow she sighed planning her next silk dress as she did up the titian hair in curlers chapter iii when the world was considerably younger it dressed children in stays long skirts to trip up tender little feet and jewelled collars to make tiny necks ache now that the world is growing evil and the time is waxing late the grown ups have turned the tables and they dress like the children witness thereof to be found in the costume of aunt belle todd mark constantine s sister who had shared her brother s fortunes ever since his wife had been presented with the marble monument like all women who have ceased having birthdays aunt belle had not ceased struggling she still had hopes of a financier who would carry her off in a storm of warmed over romance to a castle in kansas her first husband was thomas todd the carpenter chiefly distinguished for falling off a three story building on which he was working and never harming a hair of his head also for singing first bass in the village quartet aunt belle had slightly recoloured her past since she had lived with her brother the account of mr todd s singing in the quartet which was abandoned because of aunt belle s dislike of stage life and its temptations while his rolling off the three story building was never alluded to except when mark constantine wished to tease she was a short plump person with permanently jet black hair and twinkling eyes prepared to forgo all else save elegance she had brought up her gorgeous niece with the idea that it was never possible to have too much luxury seated in the gorgeous girl s dressing room she now presented excellent proof that the world was growing very old indeed for her plump self was squeezed into a short purple affair made like a pinafore her high heeled bronze slippers causing her to totter like a mandarin s wife and strings of coral beads and a gold lorgnette rose and fell with rhythmic motion as she sighed very properly over her niece s marriage it will never be the same darling she was saying glancing in a mirror to see if the light showed the rouge boundaries too clearly never quite for you have been just as dear as one beatrice who was busy inspecting some newly arrived lingerie did not glance up as she answered do nt be silly you know it s a relief you can sit back and rest from now on until i m divorced she added with a smile how can you even say such a thing beatrice tossed the filmy creamy silk somethings or other away and delivered herself of her mind alice twill was divorced before she married this specimen so
belief that this last conjecture was the true one the world outside was turning dark the sky was growing thick and low in half an hour a storm would break the eskimos had foreseen that storm they knew that the trail taken in their flight after they had possessed themselves of the girl would very soon be hidden from the eyes of bram and the keen scent of his wolves so they had taken the chance the chance to make celie their prisoner before bram returned and why philip asked himself did these savage little barbarians of the north want her the fighting she had long time the kogmollocks had been making trouble in the last year they had killed a dozen white men along the upper coast including two american explorers and a missionary three patrols had been sent to coronation gulf and bathurst inlet since august with the first of those patrols headed by olaf anderson the swede he had come within an ace of going himself a rumor had come down to churchill just before he left for the barrens that olaf s party of five men had been wiped out it was not difficult to understand why the eskimos had attacked celie armin s father and those who had come ashore with him from the ship it was merely a question of lust for white men s blood and white men s plunder and strangers in their country would naturally be regarded as easy victims the mysterious and inexplicable part of the affair was their pursuit of the girl in this pursuit the kogmollocks had come far beyond the southernmost boundary of their hunting grounds philip was sufficiently ran very little of the red blooded passion of the white man matehood was more of a necessity imposed by nature than a joy in their existence and it was impossible for him to believe that even celie armin s beauty had roused the desire for possession among them his attention turned to the gathering of the storm the amazing swiftness with which the gray day was turning into the dark gloom of night fascinated him and he almost called to celie that she might look upon the phenomenon with him it was piling in from the vast barrens to the north and east and for a time it was accompanied by a stillness that was oppressive he could no longer distinguish a movement in the tops of the cedars and banskian pine beyond the corral in the corral itself he caught now and then the shadowy flitting movement of the wolves he did not hear celie when she came out of her room so intently was he straining his eyes to penetrate the thickening pall of gloom that he was unconscious there was something in the awesome darkening of the world that brought them closer in that moment and without speaking philip found her hand and held it in his own they heard then a low whispering sound a sound that came creeping up out of the end of the world like a living thing a whisper so vast that after a little it seemed to fill the universe growing louder and louder until it was no longer a whisper but a moaning shrieking wail it was appalling as the first blast of it swept over the cabin no other place in the world is there storm like the storm that sweeps over the great barren no other place in the world where storm is filled with such a moaning shrieking tumult of voice it was not new to philip he had heard it when it seemed to him that ten thousand little children were crying under the rolling and twisting onrush of the clouds he had heard it when it seemed to him the darkness was filled which rose piercing human shrieks and the sobbing grief of women s voices it had driven people mad through the long dark night of winter when for five months they caught no glimpse of the sun even the little brown eskimos went keskwao and destroyed themselves because of the madness that was in that storm and now it swept over the cabin and in celie s throat there rose a little sob so swiftly had darkness gathered that philip could no longer see her except where her face made a pale shadow in the gloom but he could feel the tremble of her body against him was it only this morning that he had first seen her he asked himself was it not a long long time ago and had she not in that time become flesh and soul a part of him he put out his arms warm and trembling and unresisting in that thick gloom she lay within them his soul rose in a wild ecstasy and rode on the his breast and he said nothing can hurt you dear nothing nothing it was a simple and meaningless thing to say that and only that and yet he repeated it over and over again holding her closer and closer until her heart was throbbing against his own nothing can hurt you nothing nothing he bent his head her face was turned up to him and suddenly he was thrilled by the warm sweet touch of her lips he kissed her she did not strain away from him he felt in that darkness the wild fire in her face nothing can hurt you nothing nothing he cried almost sobbingly in his happiness suddenly there came a blast of the storm that rocked the cabin like the butt of a battering ram and in that same moment there came from just outside the window a shrieking cry such as philip had never heard in all his life before and following the cry there rose above the tumult of the storm the howling of bram johnson that the cry must have come from bram johnson himself that the wolf man
should be ready by now i move we go back and turn in the mystery of it all too added elfreda turning to walk to the camp the guide told them not to be concerned at his absence if he did not get overland riders sought their blankets for a rest which all needed the night passed without one of the girls moving so far as any of them could remember when they were rudely awakened next morning shouts and yells from hippy wingate and a scream from emma dean brought grace elfreda anne and nora to their feet hurriedly throwing on sufficient clothing to make themselves presentable girls hurry hurry shrieked emma coming hold fast shouted elfreda briggs running out ahead of the others chapter xiv the mysterious horseman for mercy sake what is it cried elfreda emma was dancing about in a high state of excitement hippy s gone down hippy s gone down she cried gone down where demanded grace appearing on the scene at that juncture he must have gone very suddenly for i surely heard him yell less than five minutes ago averred elfreda look s tent only the top of which was visible above the ground grace was already running towards the tent believing she knew just what the trouble was hippy are you there she called i am that what s left of me answered a voice that sounded some distance away are you hurt no brown eyes i am not hurt please clear away the wreckage so we can see what we have here grace and elfreda hauled the tent out of the hole in the alkali crust and peered in hippy was sitting at the bottom about five feet below the surface and the instant grace thrust her head into the opening she uttered a cry water she exclaimed i smell it i tasted it when i landed on my head in the wet sand answered hippy it was good but i d a heap sight rather drink my water standing way wa

girls drink your fill then water the ponies no you carry the water out and let ping do the watering and immediately began digging in the sand which was wet and sticky with hippy s aid she patted the canvas blanket down as she had seen hi lang do it and in a moment the water began seeping through grace observed that it seeped much more rapidly than when the guide had performed a similar operation buckets demanded hippy they were lowered and in a few moments half a dozen of them were filled and handed up to the outstretched hands waiting to receive them this is splendid i wish mr lang were here too bad said grace might it not be a good idea for us to fire signal shots to recall him he may be within hearing sound carries a long distance on the desert suggested miss briggs fine j elfreda will you fire the shots miss briggs said she would and in a few moments three interval shots rang out elfreda fired the reply none was heard however and grace suggested that she wait half an hour or so then try it again the baling went on but the ponies and burros drank the water faster than grace and hippy could get it out of the tank and pass it up to those who were carrying water to ping who was giving it to the horses singing as he worked this was the happy refrain he sang look see you bucket fore you tly got lopee rope nuf to pump um dly one piecee mouse can dlink at liver but let he mousey

pardons the thought of food drives every other thought from my mind hippy reached down and gave grace a hand please fire another set of signal shots suggested grace shaking out her skirt to free it

joined her companions oh does nt that coffee smell good she out here than it is in the city i hope we never have another such a dry time as we have just experienced listen warned grace holding up a

and pour over a carefully made cream sauce i might add that one stalk would furnish sufficient material for several families this dish should be popular in southwestern states where the plant grows profusely and to cultivate these plants for shipping to eastern markets would be artichokes or lettuce i have found both these dishes peculiarly appetizing but i should be sorry if in introducing yucca as a food i became instrumental in the extermination of this universal and wonderfully beautiful plant for this reason i have hesitated about including yucca among these articles but when i see the bloom destroyed ruthlessly by thousands who cut it to decorate touring automobiles and fruit and vegetable stands beside the highways who carry it from its native location and stick it in the parching sun of the seashore as a temporary shelter i feel that the bloom stems might as well be used for food as to be so ruthlessly wasted the plant is hardy in the extreme growing in the most unfavorable places clinging tenaciously to sheer mountain and canyon walls after blooming and seeding the plant seems to have thrown every particle of nourishment it contains into its development it dries out and dies the spongy wood is made into pincushions for the art stores but from the roots after a few years of growth mature and repeat their life cycle while other young plants develop from the widely scattered seeds the spaniards at times call the plant quiota this word seems to be derived from quiotl which is the aztec name for agave from which plant a drink not unlike beer is produced and suggests the possibility that there might have been a time when the succulent flower stem of the yucca furnished drink as well as food for the indians after carefully re reading and making several minor corrections linda picked up her pencil and across the top of a sheet of heavy paper sketched the peaks of a chain of mountains across the base she drew a stretch of desert floor bristling with the thorns of many different cacti brilliant with their gold pink and red bloom intermingled with fine grasses and desert flower faces at the left she painstakingly drew a huge plant of yucca with a perfect circle of bayonets from the center of which uprose the gigantic flower misty bloom of the flaming tongue she worked quite as late as marian thorne had ever seen a light burning in her window when she had finished her drawing she studied it carefully a long time adding a touch here and there and then she said softly there daddy i feel that even you would think that a faithful reproduction tomorrow night i ll paint it john gilman saw the light from linda s window when he brought eileen home that night and when he left he glanced that way again and was surprised to see the room still lighted and the young figure bending over a worktable he stood very still for a few minutes wondering what could keep linda awake so far into the night and while his thoughts were upon her he wondered too why she did not care to have beautiful clothes such as eileen wore and then he went further and wondered why when she could be as entertaining as she had been the night she joined oftener and then because the mind is a queer thing and he had wondered about a given state of affairs he went a step further and wondered whether the explanation lay in linda s inclinations or in eileen s management and then his thought fastened tenaciously upon the subject of eileen s management he was a patient man he had allowed his reason and better judgment to be swayed by eileen s exquisite beauty and her blandishments he did not regret having discovered before it was too late that marian thorne was not the girl he had thought her he wanted a wife cut after the clinging vine pattern he wanted to be the dominating figure in his home it had not taken eileen long to teach him that marian was self assertive and would do a large share of dominating herself he had thought that he was perfectly satisfied and very happy with eileen yet that day he repeatedly had felt piqued and annoyed with her she had openly cajoled and flirted with henry anderson past a sweetheart go with another man with peter morrison she had been unspeakably charming in a manner with which john was very familiar he turned up his coat collar thrust his hands in his pockets and swore softly looking straight ahead of him he should have seen a stretch of level sidewalk bordered on one hand by lacy tropical foliage on the other by sheets of level green lawn broken everywhere by the uprising boles of great trees clumps of rare vines and rows of darkened homes attractive in architectural design vine covered hushed for the night what he really saw was a small plateau sun illumined at the foot of a mountain across the valley where the lilac wall was the bluest where the sun shone slightly more golden than anywhere else in the valley where huge live oaks outstretched rugged arms where the air had a tang of salt a tinge of sage an odor of orange shot through with snowy coolness thrilled big spring breaking from the foot of the mountain they had left the road and followed a narrow screened path by which they came unexpectedly into this opening they had stood upon it in wordless enchantment looking down the slope beneath it across the peace of the valley to the blue ranges beyond just where are we peter morrison had asked at last john gilman had been looking at a view which included eileen she lifted her face flushed and exquisite to peter morrison and answered in a breathless undertone yet john
this from view his excitement was intense extraordinary and from the deep hidden recesses of his mind there began to emerge spectres of early childhood old beliefs banished superstitions the coachman proposed another route he shook his head and said that he would wait he leaned forward to get a better look at the card reader s house then he made a gesture of self ridicule it had entered his mind to consult the fortune teller who seemed to be hovering over him far far above with vast ash colored wings she disappeared reappeared and then her image was lost then in a few moments the ash colored wings stirred again nearer flying about him in narrowing circles in the street men were shouting dragging away the coach there now push that s it now in a short while the obstruction was removed other things but the voice of rita s husband whispered into his ears the words of the letter come immediately and he could behold the anguish of the drama he trembled the house seemed to look right at him his feet instinctively moved as if to leave the carriage and go in camillo found himself before a long opaque veil he thought rapidly of the inexplicability of so many things the voice of his mother was repeating to him a host of extraordinary happenings and the very sentence of the prince of denmark kept echoing within him there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in our philosophy what could he lose by it if he jumped out to the pavement just before the fortune teller s door he told the driver to wait for him and hastened into the entry ascending the stairs there was little light the stairs were worn away from the many feet that had but he saw and felt nothing he stumbled up the stairs and knocked nobody appearing he was about to go down but it was too late now curiosity was whipping his blood and his heart beat with violent throbs he turned back to the door and knocked once twice three times he beheld a woman it was the card reader camillo said that he had come to consult her and she bade him enter thence they climbed to the attic by a staircase even worse than the first and buried in deeper gloom at the top there was a garret ill lighted by a small window old furniture somber walls and an air of poverty augmented rather than destroyed the prestige of the occupant the fortune teller told him to be seated before the table and she sat down on the opposite side with her back to the window so that whatever little light came from without fell full upon camillo s face she opened a drawer and while she rapidly shuffled them she peered at him closely not so much with a direct gaze as from under her eyes she was a woman of forty italian thin and swarthy with large sharp cunning eyes she placed three cards upon the table and said let us first see what has brought you here the gentleman has just received a severe shock and is in great fear camillo astonished nodded affirmatively and he wishes to know she continued whether anything will happen to him or not to me and to her he explained excitedly the fortune teller did not smile she simply told him to wait she took the cards hastily once more and shuffled them with her long tapering fingers whose nails were so long and unclean from neglect she shuffled them well once twice thrice then she began to lay them out camillo s eyes were riveted upon her in anxious curiosity forward to drink in her words one by one then she told him to fear nothing nothing would happen to him or to the other he the third was aware of nought nevertheless great caution was indispensable envy and rivalry were at work she spoke to him of the love that bound them of rita s beauty camillo was bewildered the fortune teller stopped talking gathered the cards and locked them in the drawer the lady has restored peace to my spirit he said offering her his hand across the table and pressing that of the card reader she arose laughing go she said go ragazzo innamorato italian for love sick boy young lover etc and arising she touched his head with her index finger camillo shuddered as if it were the hand of one of the original sybils and he too arose the fortune teller went to the bureau a cluster of them and commenced to eat them showing two rows of teeth that were as white as her nails were black even in this common action the woman possessed an air all her own camillo anxious to leave was at a loss how much to pay he did not know her fee raisins cost money he said at length taking out his pocket book how much do you want to send for ask your heart she replied camillo took out a note for ten milreis and gave it to her the eyes of the card reader sparkled her usual fee was two milreis in united states money ten brazilian milreis are equivalent to about i can see easily that the gentleman loves his lady very much and well he may for she loves the gentleman very deeply too go go in peace with your mind at ease and take care as you descend the staircase the fortune teller had already placed the note in her pocket and accompanied him down the stairs chatting rather gaily at the bottom of the first flight camillo bid her good bye and ran down the stairs that led to the street while the card reader rejoicing in her large fee turned back to the garret humming a barcarolle camillo found the tilbury

been hungry he d have been in a terrible temper and he d have fought this turkey bird until there was nothing left of him but his tail feathers turkey proudfoot never knew what a narrow escape he had as soon as it began to grow light he dropped down out of the oak tree and hurried home for he did nt want to miss the breakfast that farmer green always gave him along in the fall breakfasts always seemed to be bigger xxii cranberry sauce ho hum old mr crow yawned he had stopped to talk with turkey proudfoot in the cornfield it was fall and the shocks of corn stood on every hand like great fat scarecrows with fat yellow pumpkins lying at their feet as if the scarecrows heads had fallen off mr crow always yawned a good deal when he chatted with turkey proudfoot and been about covering up his yawns somehow mr crow found turkey proudfoot dull company turkey proudfoot had never been off the farm on the other hand old mr crow was a great traveller in his younger days he used to spend every winter in the south and though he felt that
if he ordered it he would have to force it through or the prestige he had between the terror of a white man s gun and the terror of a ha nt the latter was the more powerful motioning stuart to enter and showing the narrow ledge around the pit with the spotlight he followed then he turned to the guards clustered outside close the door he ordered curtly this command was obeyed with alacrity the negro guards were only too anxious to see that hole in the wall shut suppose the ghost of christophe should come gliding out among them so far the cuban was safe he had reached the citadel and entered it he had no fear that the warders would open it again to spy on him their terror was too real raising the spotlight so that it flashed full upon stuart s face the cuban spoke understand me now he said curtly and with a hard ring in his voice how much of your story may be true and how much false i have say about hating leborge is true i will put you in a place where you will be able to see him you have a pistol i know if you see leborge raise pistol or knife against me shoot and shoot quickly i will make you rich stuart thought to himself that if the conspirators were to come to quarreling that was the very time he would keep still he certainly had no desire for bloodshed nor any intention to fire at anybody if he could help it but he only answered i understand manuel s intention was no less concealed he planned either to reveal the boy to his fellow conspirators or else to reveal him to the negro warders as a white intruder either way he figured there would be an end to the boy by the light of his lamp consulting a small manuscript chart of the ruin manuel passed through many tortuous passages and dark chambers until he came to crumbling stones he set his eye to a crevice nodded as though satisfied wrenched away several more stones laying these down silently and beckoned stuart to come beside him the boy looked down on a circular hall the outer arc of which was pierced with ruined windows opening to the sky leborge will sit there whispered manuel pointing kill him and you will be rich stuart nodded he did not trust himself to speak walking as silently as he could manuel left the place pondering in his own mind what he was going to do with the boy should he reveal the secret and have his fellow conspirators kill him should he turn him over to the machetes of the negroes or should he kill the boy himself one thing he had determined that stuart should not reach the plains below alive and stuart in that hole of the ruined wall crouched and watched of what was to happen in that room below had no knowledge yet over his eager desire to find out this conspiracy against the united states above his anxiety with regard to the fate of his father one question loomed in ever larger and blacker proportions he had got into the citadel how was he to get out chapter iv the ghost of christophe manuel was no coward somewhere back in his spanish ancestry had been a single drop of an irish strain adding a certain combativeness to the gallantry of his race that drop too mixed badly with spanish treachery and made him doubly dangerous certainly the cuban was no coward but as he came out from the murk of those chambers with their rotting floors many of them undermined by oubliettes and dungeons he felt a chill of fear even the occasional bursts of sunshine through the cloud fog which perpetually sweeps over la ferriere did not hearten him he passed into the open space back of the outer walls and set himself to climb the long flight he thought his fellow conspirators might be but on the summit he found himself alone the battlements cowed his spirits with walls fifteen feet thick wide enough to allow a carriage to be driven upon them they looked over a sheer drop of two thousand feet sinister and forbidding even the sunlight could not lessen their grimness as if in memory of the hundreds of victims who had been bidden jump off those ramparts merely for christophe s amusement or who had been hurled screaming as penalty for his displeasure a ruddy moss feeding upon decay has spread over the stones and this moss ever kept damp by the cloud banks which wreathe the citadel continually is moistly red like newly shed blood in cracks and corners fungi of poisonous hues adds another touch of wickedness manuel shivered with repulsion probably not in all the world certainly not in the western hemisphere is there a ruin of such historic terror as the citadel of the this ruin now is nominally in territory under the jurisdiction of an american provost marshal it is therefore less difficult of access than formerly but it is still considered unsafe for travelers a gleam of sun revealed the extraordinary impregnability of the place the double walled entrance from the hillside pierced by but a single gate could only be battered down by heavy artillery and no guns powerful enough for such a feat could be brought up the hill the inner citadel access to which was only by a long flight of steps is unapproachable from any other point and a handful of defenders could keep an army at bay the cliff side is as sheer as gibraltar affording not even a foothold for the most venturesome climber the walls are built upon its very verge and are as solid as the rock itself its gray mass conveys a sense of enormous power it towers upon the last and highest
it complete it is i have it with me at the hotel send it down to me he said quickly i ll read it and give you a verdict at once in an illogical glow of hope i hastened to fetch the manuscript and in less than two hours it was in his hands i speak of my hope as illogical for if the literary monthly of my own publishers could not find a place for it how could i reasonably expect a hustling bustling popular weekly like collier s to use it nevertheless something in sullivan s voice and manner restored my confidence and when i called on the editor of the century i was able to assume the tone of successful authorship the closer i got to my market the more assured i my thirty years of effort were remembered in my favor on tuesday sullivan who had been called to the west wired me from chicago that a son of the middle border would make an admirable serial and that his assistants would take the matter up with me i predict a great success for it that night i sent a message to my wife in which i exultantly said rejoice i ve sold the middle border to collier s weekly our troubles are over for a year at least two days later collier s took a short story at four hundred dollars and the century gave me three hundred for an article on james a herne and when i boarded the train for chicago the following week i was not only four thousand dollars better off than when i came i had regained my faith in the future my task was clearly outlined for the seventh time i set to work revising a son of the middle border preparing it for serial publication had been writing upon this story for years stared at me in silent amazement when i told him of its sale that the editor of a great periodical should be interested in a record of the migrations and failures of the mcclintocks and garlands was incredible nevertheless he was eager to see it in print and when in march the first installment appeared he read it with absorbed attention and mixed emotions are nt you a little hard on me he asked with a light in his eyes which was half humorous half resentful i do nt think so father i replied you must admit you were a stern disciplinarian in those days well maybe i was but i did nt realize it my first understanding of the depths this serial sounded came to me in the letters which were written to the editor by those who could not find words in which to express their longing for the bright world gone the world when they were young and glad you have written meant that the facts of my family history and my own emotional experiences were so nearly theirs that my lines awoke an almost intolerable regret in their hearts an ache which is in my own heart to day the world old hunger of the gray haired man dwelling upon the hope and illusions of youth these responses which indicated a wider and more lasting effect than i had hoped to produce led me to plan for the publication of the book close on the heels of the concluding installment of the serial but in this i was disappointed the mexican war suddenly thrust new and tremendously exciting news articles into the magazine separating and delaying the printing of my story had it not been for the loyalty of mark sullivan it would have been completely side tracked but he would not have it so on the contrary he began to talk with me about printing six more installments and this necessarily put off the question of finding a publisher for the book nevertheless i returned to my desk in the expectation that the mexican excitement was only complete the publication of the manuscript within the year my harvest was not destroyed it was only delayed chapter twenty six a spray of wild roses although for several years my wife and children had spent four months of each year in west salem and notwithstanding the fact that my father was free to come down to visit us at any time i suffered a feeling of uneasiness almost of guilt whenever i thought of him camping alone for the larger part of the year in that big silent house his love for the children and for zulime made every day of his lonely life a reproach to me and yet there seemed no way in which i could justly grant him more of our time the welfare of my wife and the education of the children must be considered he was nearing his eighty fourth birthday and a realization that every week in which he did not see his granddaughters was an irreparable loss gave me uneasiness it was a comfort to think of him sitting which he loved and found a solace and yet he was a lonely old man that could not be denied he made no complaint in his short infrequent letters although as spring came on he once or twice asked why do nt you come up the best place for the children is on the lawn under the maples in one note to me he said my old legs are giving out i do nt enjoy walking any more i do nt stand the work of the garden as well as i did last year you d better come up and help me put in the seed this confession produced in me a keen pang he who had marched so tirelessly under the lead of grant and thomas he who had fearlessly cruised the pine forests of wisconsin and joyously explored the prairies of iowa and minnesota was now uncertain of his footing alarmed more than i
names of all the geysers and woodchucks and that man was nt right polite to me said maw in commenting upon some of this he told me he was busy i d like to know what he s got to do just setting round myself i sometimes think the punishment obliged for instance to know everything in the world that everyone else in the world does not know he has pictures and exact measurements of all the game animals in the park all the flowers knows all the colors of the grand canyon and the location of every sprinkling hose in fifty square miles i have never been able to ask him any questions that he can not answer except perhaps my favorite question why do they have this curio junk in all the park stores moccasins leather indian heads and all that sort of thing he sobbed when i asked him that but i thought i could hear some muttered word about there being a popular demand as for me i hold with maw that if a person is being bitten on the elbow better a bottle of marmalade a loaf of bread or a bottle of mosquito dope than a pair of beef hide moccasins with puckered toes in my belief a few paintings by mr thomas moran at or sets of the works of some of our more popular authors with flexible backs would be far more appropriate in the curio stores maw is of the opinion that most of the merchants storekeepers and venders of commodities west of the mississippi river are robbers not that i mean real robbers like used to hold up the stagecoaches here in the park she explained they do nt do that no more since the cars has come i suppose because they go so fast that it ai nt convenient for robbers no more but in the old times they tell me when they run stagecoaches in here and did nt have no railroad in on the west side there used to be a regular business of holding up the stagecoaches right over where old man dwelley used to have his eating house for lunch there s a clubhouse there now instead of his old eating house they say i heard that when they wanted to buy old man dwelley out for he thought a while and then did some counting and then allowed that about twelve thousand dollars would be about right the man that was buying the place he set down and writ a check right then for twelve thousand dollars but old man dwelley did nt take it i du n no what that thing is says he when i say twelve thousand dollars i mean twelve thousand dollars in real money when bozeman was riled they told him he had for to wait a few days and they went over to livingston and got twelve thousand dollars in five dollar bills and brung it to dwelley and told him to count it he counted a little of it and then said it was all right he d take their word for it that there was twelve thousand dollars there so then he put it in a sack where he had some beaver hides they told me he sent it all by express to a fur buyer in salt lake in a bank he had one thousand five hundred dollars saved out so they told me and he put that in the bank over to bozeman it riled them people at bozeman a good deal to think that anybody not from bozeman should have one thousand five hundred dollars inaccessible in their town so one day when old man dwelley was there they fined him one thousand five hundred dollars for killing a elk out of season or something that made him mad still and all he had his twelve thousand dollars left not mentioning what he got for his beaver hides one thing with another continued maw after a period of rumination you ca nt say but what this park is a fine place of course there s always a wonder in my mind where they get all the hot water for the geysers it looks to me like a industrial waste if the geysers could be used for laundries that would be something like then again throw in some bluing now and then or some red or green they d look prettier that d give more variety like yet they say these geysers has been running for years and no let up ai nt it funny the things you see away from home illustration if the geysers could be used for laundries that would be something like maw p i like to ride along these roads up in the mountains and look down at the rivers you get way up above a river and it looks like a long washboard down below here in the mountains and i ll have to say the roads is crooked i say to paw we re all church members except cynthy which went to college and if we go we go and even if we do why we ve all had a vacation and i ll tell it to the world that a vacation trip once in a lifetime is what the preacher says about idleness i m strong for vacations from this time on fact is i believe paw and me has got to have them though this is our first and to think we was afraid to buy ice cream once except on the fourth of july now paw goes right up to one of them stands and buys five dollars of gasoline like it was nothing times has changed like i said lookit at our car now i can remember back not so far neither when if i got a ride in a side bar buggy i thought i was a mighty lucky girl and here
when he elbowed his way through the press of fishermen who thronged the buffalo bar he saw the russian surrounded by a jeering crowd got a job yet boris some one called he s workin for the lang girl now put in another boris snarled and flinging his tormentors away from him made his way to the bar jabbering excitedly in russian to pete ankovitch blagg moved nearer what s he sayin pete he to hell he interpreted he say he show mascola he ai nt fraid of no woman blagg strove to focus his mind on the russian s words boris was sore as a boiled oil crazy as a coot and he had it in for the lang girl for causing him to get the can the russian s reference to mascola caused the furrows in blagg s brow to deepen both of them were sore at the girl were they framing up if they were he d block the boss s game he d wise her she d always shot straight enough with him anyway and he was a fool to have ever quit her if mascola was baiting the russian to pull off some dirty work he d blagg paused in his tentative plans for outwitting mascola as his eye fell on neilson there was the man he wanted to see swan could swing the swedes into quitting the dago all thought of boris vanished from blagg s the big swede in a drunken whisper when he looked about for the russian some time later boris was gone blagg drained the contents of his last glass with a wry face and walked unsteadily to the door colliding with a man on the sidewalk he regained his poise by leaning heavily against a sandwich sign board hello blagg seen any of my men inside blagg shoved back his cap and eyed the speaker with drunken suspicion when he recognized the cannery owner a furtive light crept into his eyes and he beckoned gregory closer gregory noted the mysterious mien and promptly credited it to the man s state of intoxication he was on the point of hurrying on when blagg s words stayed him tell lang girl t look out for self what do you mean gregory grasped him by the arm and whirled him about was in s loon blagg muttered striving to focus his bleary eyes upon his auditor him an boris tol em he was t fraid no woman said he d show em does he live over there gregory asked quickly pointing toward the lang hill blagg shook his head and nodded in the opposite direction down there he corrected think he but gregory did not wait to hear what blagg thought blagg looked after him stupidly he had had no time to speak of his hatred or suspicion of mascola but he d show the dago yet a crowd of fishermen lumbered along the sidewalk toward him talking excitedly leaning against the sign board blagg was able to gather from their conversation that a fight had just occurred at the red paint some one had tried to get square with the boss and mascola had knifed him cold sweat broke out on joe blagg s forehead to his whirling brain came other instances he had heard of how mascola always got square with those who opposed perhaps he had gone too far suppose neilson with a desire to get in strong with the boss should tell mascola that he joe blagg was trying to start a strike among the alien fishermen and a swede liked to talk too why not get out of town for a while till the thing blew over he was nt afraid of the dago and his whole crowd but what was the use of starting a row besides he was ready to move anyway he reflected suddenly that the midnight train for frisco stopped at legonia on signal that would give him time to throw his stuff together he had already drawn his money why not hit the grit as jack mccoy took his way down the hillside he was acutely conscious of the fact that the evening had been a distinct disappointment why was gregory there anyway that talk about his forgetting his papers sounded mighty thin how many times had the boss been there before what of funny did nt seem to care whether he stayed any longer or not mccoy stopped by the roadside as he caught sight of a man running hastily along one of the streets leading from the town whoever the fellow was he was sure in a hurry the way he was cutting cross lots as the runner came under the rays of the corner arc light mccoy started and peered intently after the departing figure it sure looked like gregory and he was angling in the direction of the lang hill the idea clung tenaciously when he reached his rooming house it became an obsession he decided to find out if the runner could have been his employer calling up the cannery it was some time before a sleepy voice answered his summons boss ai nt here went out at eight and ai nt been back since want to leave message mccoy snapped up the receiver and walked slowly into his room so it was gregory where had he been going at this the forgetting of the paper was only a frame up dick had acted funny now he knew it was because she wanted to get rid of him he sat on the bed making no effort to remove his clothes you re a poor fish something whispered why do nt you go and find out if they re double crossing you mccoy tried not to listen for a long time he stared moodily at the floor then he rose and threw off his coat hastily replaced it and hurried to the door he was ashamed of his

by the ones for whom she works and prays if elizabeth hall had known and if her boys had known what lay just ahead perhaps the days would have been made fuller yet of loving counsel and happy association but the veil was before their faces and they did not know possibly that was best if the veil were lifted and us it is enough that for each day is given grace for its toils elizabeth loved her boys and was giving them the best of herself and that is all she could have done if she had known chapter the stricken home henry hill sat before the fire with his head in his hands and his elbows upon his knees a picture of utter dejection and sorrow the house was quiet with an unearthly quietness those who were compelled to speak using the lowest tones and tiptoeing about the little ones doyle lila and harry were not at home amy and nell were silently tearfully trying to wash the few dishes that had been used at the almost untouched breakfast the boys were attending to the morning chores with faces as solemn and hearts as heavy as each could carry a neighbor woman kind sympathetic and busy but with the same sadness pictured upon her face kept coming and going between the bedroom and the room physician had been there and had told them that she whose life had been the light and strength of the home was lying now upon her death bed that she would never again rise to take the burdens of life that they would have to let her go he had felt for henry hill as he had spoken for the white horror and anguish in the man s face would have called out sympathy from a harder heart but he wanted to say also that had she been given a lighter load to carry if some of the anxiety and concern that now stirred his heart had been expressed when his wife was well things might not now be as they are but the kind doctor left these words unsaid henry hill had all he could bear without them the holidays with their festivities were over and life had just settled back into its every day way when elizabeth hill fell sick she had never been ailing before her children had always known her as able to without her they were helpless and distraught for there was no one to take her place and when after one day s illness it became certain that her condition was critical the anxiety and tension became intense he who should have lightened her burden long ago now awoke to her need and was constantly by her side doing all that was in his power to restore her to health but the black cloud settled heavier upon the home as each day saw the mother coming nearer the gates of death the children looked at one another with pale faces and wide frightened eyes as they saw the kind neighbor women come from their mother s bed with averted faces though all was done that could be done they could not hold her and one night with her weeping family around her she loosed from her earthly habitation and went away she who had been the soul of that home lay dead the calamity came upon the family like a shock it left no spirit nor turn from the father down to baby doyle they were bereft she to whom they had always looked for counsel and guidance lay in a sublime sleep from which they could not waken her as henry hill looked upon the motionless form of the woman whose love and confidence he had gained and who had been to him such a faithful wife in spite of his fickleness he wept and vowed but what are tears and vows when the will has been weakened by self indulgence he looked about him helplessly what was he to do what could he do without her he was almost a stranger to his children and had no idea how to care for them she had always carried the burden taken the oversight been the one to go ahead he faced the future as helplessly as one of his little children her boys looked upon her and knew that they had lost their best friend home would have little more attraction for them george and wilbur took selfish comfort to care for themselves but austin forgot himself in wondering what would become of the children the little ones spoke to mama but she did not answer they called to her but she did not hear and they went away weeping for though they could not tell what they knew something dreadful had happened kind friends and neighbors came in and did what has to be done at such a time they pitied with full hearts the afflicted family and they wept for their friend for they too had loved her they took her and laid her with others of death s sleepers in the silent churchyard and her orphaned children returned with their helpless father to the lonely and broken home only those who have returned home after mother is gone know what these children and father suffered kind hands had put the house in order and the familiar furniture in its accustomed place endeavoring to make the house look as if all were well but they could not bring back the the children it was a dreary lonely place fearfully they crept out of doors only to find it as cheerless there that first night around the fireside without her what a desolate place it was the father sat with drooped head and heaving breast and the children huddled together and some of them sobbed just to escape their misery they went early to bed and little pillows were wet with tears when they were
the form across the glade was no longer motionless straining ben saw the soft roll of a great shadow almost imperceptible in the gloom advancing slowly toward him then the faint glow of the fire caught and reflected in the creature s eyes they suddenly glowed out in the half darkness two rather small circles of dark visitor was not moose or caribou or was it one of the lesser hunters lynx or wolverine or a panther wandered far from his accustomed haunts the twin circles were too far above the ground and whatever it was no doubt remained but that the creature was steadily stalking him across the soft grass at that instant ben s muscles snapped into action only a second remained in which to make his defense the creature had paused setting his muscles for a death dealing charge go back into the cave as far as you can he said swiftly to beatrice his own eyes squinted and straining for the last iota of vision in that darkened scene made a last frantic search for his rifle suddenly he saw the gleam of its barrel as it rested against the wall of the cliff fifteen feet distant at once he knew that his only course was to spring for it in the instant that remained and trust to its mighty shocking power yet it seemed to tear the life fiber of the man to do it his inmost instincts urgent and loud in his ear told him to remain on guard not to leave that cavern maw for an instant but to protect with his own body the precious life that it sheltered his mind worked with that incredible speed that is usually manifest in a crisis and he knew that the creature might charge into the cavern entrance in the second that he left it yet only in the rifle lay the least chance or hope for either of them at him fenris he shouted the wolf leaped forward like a thrown spear almost too fast for the eye to follow he was deathly afraid with full knowledge of the power of the enemy he went to combat but his fears were impotent to restrain him at the first sound of that masterful voice these were the words he had waited for he could never disobey such words as these mind had worked true he knew that the wolf could likely hold the creature at bay until he could seize his rifle in an instant it was in his hands and he had sprung back to his post in front of the cavern maw and presently he remembered heartsick that the weapon was not loaded for his own safety he had kept it empty on the outward journey partly to prevent accident partly to be sure that his prisoner could not turn it against him but he had shells in the pocket of his jacket his hand groped but his reaching fingers found but one shell dropping it swiftly into the gun and now he knew that no time remained to seek another the beast in the darkness had launched into the charge thereafter there was only a great confusion event piled upon event with incredible rapidity and a whole lifetime of stress and fear lived in a single instant the creature s first lunge carried him into the brighter moonlight could mistake the high rocking shoulders the burly form the wicked ears laid back against the flat massive head the fangs gleaming white the long hooked claws slashing through the turf as he ran it was a terrible thing to see and stand against in the half darkness the shadows accentuated the towering outline and forgotten terrors lurking since the world was young in the labyrinth of the germ plasm wakened and spread like icy streams through the mortal body and seemed to threaten to extinguish the warm flame of the very soul the grizzly bawled as he came an explosive incredible storm of sound few indeed are the wilderness creatures that can charge in silence muscular exertion can not alone relieve their gathered flood of madness and fury and at once ben sensed the impulse behind the attack he and the girl had made their home in the grizzly s cave perhaps the lair wherein he had hibernated through the winter and which he still slept in from time out only death could pay for such insolence as this to make a night s lair in the den of his sovereignty the grizzly it is not the accustomed thing for a grizzly to make an unprovoked attack he has done it many times in the history of the west but usually he is glad enough to turn aside only launching into his terrible death charge when a mortal wound obliterates his fear of man leaving only his fear of death but this grizzly native to these uninhabited wilds had no fear of man to forget he did not know what man was and he had not learned the death that dwells in the shining weapon he carries in his arms no trappers mushed through his snows of spring no woodsman rode his winding trails true from the first instant that the human smell had reached him on the wind he had been disturbed and discomfited yet it was not grizzly nature to yield his den without a fight the sight only wakened an added rage in his fierce heart the wolf met him at his first leap springing with noble courage at his grizzled throat and the bear paused in his charge to strike him away he lashed out with his great forepaw and if that blow had gone straight home the ribs of the wolf would have been smashed flat on his heart and lungs the tough trunk of a young spruce would have been broken as quickly under that terrible blasting full stroke of a grizzly the largest grizzly weighs but

douglas dismounted and fastened the horses to a scrub cedar then he wallowed forward afoot to break trail the wind increased constantly with the elevation but even higher than its eerie note sounded the wild call of a solitary coyote douglas heard the call but remotely his he beat trail until his lungs protested then he brought the horses forward halted and beat trail again his nose was bleeding slightly when he at last won to the crest of the first shoulder this was blown clear of snow and he mounted and rode well up on the second shoulder before the horses again balked lost chief range now had dropped so that dimly beyond he could glimpse the indian peaks the strange peaks to the right were subsiding to be dwarfed by still other peaks against which the stars floated pendulous and brilliant and still black devil s top was invisible beyond the terraced ridge that opposed the little cavalcade when after infinite effort douglas surmounted the third shoulder he paused appalled by the loneliness and danger of the position the ridge had narrowed until its top offered barely a foothold with sides dropping to unthinkable depths the snow had blown clear and the wind was almost insupportable a cedar stood before them like a sentinal guarding the eternal were his last hope as the horses brought up in the shelter of the tree douglas gave a hoarse cry of relief and dismounted some charred sticks and the remains of a cottontail had not yet blown away douglas examined the traces of the hasty camp then chuckled safe so far some girl my judith then his jaw stiffened and he set the horses to the last shoulder below the pass groaning trembling bloody flanks heaving fighting constantly to turn tom when douglas sought to force him through the drift that topped the shoulder deliberately lay down douglas freed himself from the stirrups and jerked the horse to his feet i would nt own an ornery unwilling brute like you for a ranch he panted do you think i m enjoying this that we are a bunch of dudes on a summer outing i ll get angry at you in a moment fellow the pack horse had embraced the opportunity s tirade did his not inconsiderable best to kick his mate then he snapped at douglas who promptly cuffed him on the nose tom reared fell and began to roll down the terrible slope the pack horse did not waken nor stir doug flung himself after tom slipping falling rolling he finally caught the reins and though tom dragged him fifty yards on downward he at last braced his spurs against a boulder the reins held and tom brought up trembling and coughing and now horse and man could only stand for a long time struggling for breath when his numbing hands gave warning that his rest period must cease douglas with the reins caught over his elbow began a fight back to the crest of the ridge a fight to which the previous portion of the trip had been as nothing when they reached the led horse still sleeping with his nose between his fore legs there was no more fight left in tom and was setting when he led his little train through the gigantic drift to the long slope which lifted to the pass there was no snow here the slope as far as doug could discern in the failing light was a glare of rough ice over this he dared not urge the horses until daylight he looked at his watch it was nearly five o clock he fastened the horses to the only cedar in sight then stood in the wind debating with himself he was very much exhausted and the rare air and the intense cold were giving him no chance to recoup this was no place to make camp the tiny cedar offered neither shelter from the wind nor an adequate amount of fuel and up here in this hostile loneliness his anxiety over judith returned threefold strong as she was clever as she was she was as open to accidents as he supposing her horses had slipped on this ice and had gone over the black edge douglas dropped to surface a hundred yards of this and he brought to pause before a giant boulder beside which grew several dwarf cedars he drew his ax from its sheath and after long effort with his stiffened fingers he got the green wood to burning dawn about seven found him napping against the warm face of the rock he brought the horses up to the camp fed them and himself and as the sun shot over the indian range then prepared to lead the horses onward the crest of black devil now lifted immediately above him just below the crest a ledge broad enough for a pack team led straight into the blue of the sky to the right the dark wall of the crest to the left a sheer drop where the canyon between lost chief range and black devil yawned hideously this ledge this narrow painful crossing made the pass douglas drew his ax and prepared to roughen a trail over the ice for the horses but to his unspeakable that another ax
curious and timid johnnie what small feet and little hands you have you re a regular aristocrat a pause i give her a poem written to her she reads it letting her knife stick in a half peeled potato she looks up at me out of heavy lidded eyes i believe you re falling in love with me i trembled answered nothing was silent kiss me seeing me so a tremble she obeyed her own injunction with slow deliberation she crushed her lips full and voluptuous into mine the warmth of them seemed to catch hold of something deep down in me and with exquisite i clutched close to her she laughed i put one hand over her full breast as infants do she pushed me back there that s enough for one day a promise of sweets to come and she laughed again with a hearty purr like a cat that has a mouse at its mercy she rose and carried in the pan of potatoes we had just finished peeling and i saw her sturdy but not unshapely ankles going from me as she went up the steps from the yard her legs gleaming white through her half silk hose that were always coming down and that she was always twisting up just under her knees before my abashed eyes she wore shoes much too little for her plump feet and when not abroad let them yawn open unbuttoned and her plump body was alive and bursting through her careless half fastened clothes she sang with a deep sultriness of voice as she walked away with the pan of potatoes florrie read books exclaimed the mother flora did read a lot but chiefly the erotic near society novels that belford used to print yes she s a smart girl she is and the father i wo nt work till the unions get better conditions for a man i wo nt be no slave to no man one sultry afternoon i went into the restaurant and found flora away poignantly disappointed i asked where she was gone on a trip her mother explained without explaining from time to time flora went on trips and one morning several mornings flora was not there to serve at the breakfast table and i was hurt when i learned that she had gone back to newark to live and had left no word for me her father told me she had gone back to george meaning her never seen husband from whom she evidently and hurt indeed because she had not even said good bye to me but soon came this brief note from her dearest boy do come up to newark and see me some afternoon and come more than once bring your tennyson that you was reading aloud to me i love to hear you read poetry i think you are a dear and want to see more of you but i suppose you have already forgotten your loving flora in the absurd and pitiful folly of youth i lifted the letter to my lips and kissed it i trembled with eagerness till the paper rattled as i read it again and again it seemed like some precious holy script i bolted my lunch nervously and it stuck half way down in a hard lump i would go to her that very afternoon the car on which i rode was subject to too frequent stoppage for me i leaped out and walked along with brisk strides but the car of roadway and i ran after it to catch it again the conductor looked back at me in derisive scorn and made a significant whirling motion near his temple with his index finger indicating that i had wheels there at last i found the street where flora lived i trailed from door to door till the number she had given me met my eye it made my heart jump and my knees give in to be so near the quarry for the first time i was to be alone with a woman i desired at the bell it took me a long time to gain courage to pull but at last i reached out my hand i had to stand my ground i could nt run away now the bell made a tinkling sound far within the door opened cautiously a head of touseled black hair crept out johnnie dear you you are a surprise did i really detect an echo of disappointment heart like a trapped animal i went in down a long dusk musty smelling corridor and into a back apartment on the first floor she led me into a room which was bed and sitting room combined in one part of it stood several upholstered chairs with covers on cluttered about a plain table in the other part stood a bureau heaped with promiscuous toilette articles and a huge brass knobbed bed with a spread of lace over its great semi upright pillows shall i let in a little more light dear do for the blinds were two thirds down i like to sit and think in the dark she explained and her one dimple broke in a rich brown faced animal smile yes but i i want to see your lovely face i stuttered with much effort at gallantry he s not at home he s off at wilmington on a job meaning her husband though what made you come so soon you must of just got my letter i i wanted you i blurted in the next moment i was at her feet in approved romantic fashion following up my declaration of desire calmly she let me kneel there i put my arms about her plump legs i was almost fainting after a while she took me by the hair with both hands she slowly bent my head back as i knelt leaning over she kissed deliberately deeply into my mouth then gazing into my eyes with
illustration christmas outside of eden book cover illustration there seated in the entrance to the cave the man saw the woman but not the woman as he had left her christmas outside of eden by coningsby dawson author of the garden without walls carry on etc illustrations by eugene francis savage new york dodd mead and company copyright by dodd mead and company inc printed in u s a illustrations there seated in the entrance to the cave the man saw the woman but not the woman as he had left her god had given the man and woman no time to pack he had marched them beyond the walls and locked the golden gates of eden against them forever the man yawned i am still tired fetch the horse that he may carry me back to my dwelling christmas outside of eden i beneath the holly on the eve of christmas they have told it every christmas eve since the world started they commenced telling it long before christ was born for their memory goes further back than men s the christmas which they celebrate began just outside of eden within sight of its gold locked doors the robins have only two stories one for christmas and one for easter their easter story is quite different it has to do with how they got the splash of red upon their breasts it was when god s son was hanging on the cross they wanted to do something to spare him they were too weak to pull out the nails from his feet and hands so they tore their little breasts in plucking the thorns one by one from the crown that had been set upon his forehead since then god has allowed their breasts to remain red as a remembrance of his gratitude but their christmas story happened long before when they were nt robin red breasts but only robins they twitter it in a chuckling fashion to their children if you prefer to hear it first hand creep out to the nearest holly bush on almost any christmas eve when snow has made the night all pale and shadowy if the robins have chosen your holly bush as their rendezvous and you understand their language you wo nt need to read what i have written like all true stories it is much better told than read it s the story of the first laugh that was ever heard in earth or heaven to be enjoyed properly it needs the chuckling twitter of the grown up robins and the squeaky interruptions of the baby birds asking questions when they get terrifically excited they jig up and down on the holly branches and the frozen snow falls with a brittle clatter then the mother and father birds say hush quite suddenly no one speaks for a full five seconds they huddle closer listening and holding their breath that s how the story ought to be heard little boys and girls have gone to bed early having hung up their very biggest stockings of course i ca nt tell it that way on paper but i ll do my best to repeat the precise words in which the robins tell it ii it was very long ago at the beginning of all wonders sun moon and stars were new they wandered about in the clouds uncertainly calling to one another like ships in a fog it was the same on earth neither trees nor rivers nor animals were quite sure why they had been created or what was expected of them they were terribly afraid of doing wrong and they had good reason for the man and woman had done wrong and had been locked out of eden that had happened in april when the world was three months old up to that time everything had gone very well no one had known what fear was no one had guessed that anything existed outside the walls of eden or trees and rivers had lived together with the man and the woman in the high walled garden as a happy family if they had wanted to know anything they had asked the man he had always given them answers even though he had to invent them they had never dreamt of doubting him not even the woman the reason for this had been god every afternoon god had come stepping down from the sky to walk with the man through the sun spangled shadows of the grassy paths they had heard the kindly rumble of his voice like distant thunder and the little tones of the man as he asked his questions at six o clock regularly god had shaken hands with the man and climbed leisurely back up the sky blue stairs that led to heaven because of this the man had gained a reputation among the animals for being wise they had thought of him as god s friend he had given orders to everybody even to the woman and everyone had been proud to obey him it had been been all kinds of rumours the first that had been suspected had been when god had failed to come for his customary walk the next had been when he had arrived with his face hidden in anger the trees of eden had bent and clashed as if a strong wind were blowing everything living that was not rooted had run away to hide nevertheless when god had called to the man they had tiptoed nearer to listen the trouble had seemed to be about some fruit god had told the man that he must not pluck it he had not only plucked it but had eaten of it so had the woman it had seemed a small matter to make such a fuss about they had supposed that god s anger would soon blow over and that everything would be again as friendly as before illustration god had given the
the rights of but when it comes to raising the price of food still higher and cutting off the city milk supply well when they talk of that then i begin to think of the human side of it he broke off abruptly and concluded in a less serious tone that s the only thing in the whole business i care about the human side of it all a phrase of benham s floated suddenly into her mind and she found herself repeating it aloud there are no human rights where a principle is involved vetch laughed that s not you it s benham i recognize it he s the sort that would believe that i suppose the sort that would write a political document in blood if he did nt have ink oh do nt she protested there was a grain of truth in the epigram but she resented it the more keenly for this well i may have intended it as a compliment way i reckon and anyhow you have heard him make worse flings at me she coloured admitting and denying at the same time the truth of his words you could never understand each other you are so different he looked at her gravely but even gravity could not wholly drive the gleam of humour from his eyes at any rate i admire benham i have the advantage of him there the quickness of his wit made her smile but as you say we are different he added after a moment i reckon i ve turned my hand at times to jobs of which benham would disapprove but i d be hanged before i d write the greatest document ever penned in well in the blood of one of those squirrels out yonder in the square as he finished he turned his face toward the window and following his gaze she saw the sunlight sparkling like amber wine on the as she looked back at him she wondered what his past could have been how deep how complex how varied was his experience of life she was aware again of that curiously primitive attraction which she had felt the other afternoon in the shop it was as if he appealed not to the beliefs and sentiments with which life had obscured and muffled her nature but to some buried self beneath the self that she and the world knew to some ancient instinct which was as deep as the oldest forests of earth after all was there a hidden self a buried forest within her soul which she had never discovered but patty has not given you her message she exclaimed startled and confused by the strangeness of the sensation oh there is nt much to tell answered patty wondering if she could ever learn even if she practised every day to speak and move like corinna it was only that you ought to stand by repeated vetch then he drew in his breath with a whistling sound well i like his impudence he exclaimed corinna rose with a laugh so do i she observed and he seems to possess it in abundance then she folded patty in a light and fragrant embrace you must be the belle of the ball she said i have a genius for being a chaperon when she had gone and they watched her car pass the monument the girl turned back into the hall with her hand clinging tightly to vetch s arm father what do you suppose that message meant is it obliged to mean anything things generally do do nt they vetch smiled as he looked down at her but his smile conveyed anxiety rather than amusement to her observant eyes oh if things are said by gershom they generally mean hell night there s to be a meeting then and it looks as if somebody might make trouble then he patted her shoulder do nt worry about gershom honey he added in the way he used to speak when she fell and hurt herself as a child do nt worry your mind about gershom i ll take care of him it was on the tip of her tongue to tell him that she was not worrying about gershom but about the woman dying all alone in that dark room in leigh street if he had only looked less disturbed she might have done so and when she thought of it afterward she understood that frankness would have been by far the wiser course however while she wondered what she ought to say the opportunity slipped by and the ringing of the telephone on his desk called him away from her corinna meanwhile was rolling down the drive over the slanting shadows of the linden trees she it was about vetch that made her believe in him so profoundly when she was with him and yet begin to distrust him as soon as she got far enough away to gain a perspective gossip probably she reflected when she was with him her confidence was the natural response of her own unbiassed perceptions when she left him she passed immediately into an atmosphere that was charged with the suspicions of other people she remembered the stories true or false which had been hinted and whispered before the last election malicious gossip that and as unfounded no doubt as the rest she recalled the muttered insinuations of fraudulent political stratagems of what benham had called the governor s weathercock principles in vetch s presence she realized that she invariably lost sight of these structural or surface blemishes and judged him by some standard which was different from the one she had inherited with the shape of her nose and the colour of her eyes what troubled her was not so much the riddle of vetch world beyond the one she had always inhabited and that this other world was filled like her own with obscure moral and spiritual images as
having seen the world and its splendors said it was interesting but that they would prefer to live at home these days america is an unhappy land said jack we are like a wildcat in captivity a growling quarrelsome lot well the british use the right to govern us like a baby rattle and they compared with america is but a stepping stone in a brook there s scarcely enough of it out of water to keep one s feet dry in two generations our population will exceed that of the british isles but with so many lying agents over there what chance have they to learn anything about us they will expect to hear you tell of people being tomahawked in philadelphia a city as well governed as any in england they can not understand that most of us would gladly spend nineteen shillings to the pound for the right to spend the other shilling as we please can they not be made to understand us jack inquired the power to learn is like your hand you must use it or it will wither and die there are brilliant intellects here which have lost the capacity to learn i think that profound knowledge is not for high heads i wonder just what you mean oh the moment you lose humility you stop learning doors to every intellect one lets knowledge in the other lets it out we must keep both doors in use the mind is like a purse if you keep paying out money you must now and then put some into your purse or it will be empty i once knew a man who was a liberal spender but never did any earning we soon found that he had been making counterfeit money the king s intellects have often put me in mind of him they are flush with knowledge but they never learn anything they can tell you all you may want to know but it is counterfeit knowledge how about lord north he has nailed up the door the african zebra is a good student compared to him it is a maxim of walpole and north that all men are equally corrupt it is a hateful notion jack exclaimed but not without some warrant you may be sure that a man high opinion of the health of mankind he and his friends are so engrossed by their cards and cock fights and horses and hounds that they have little time for such a trivial matter as the problems of america they postpone their consideration and meanwhile the house is catching fire by and by these boys are going to get burned they think us a lot of semi savages not to be taken seriously our new england farmers are supposed to be like the peasants of europe the fact is our average farmer is a man of better intellect and character than the average member of parliament the king s intellects would seem to be out of order said jack and too cynical they think only of revenues they remind me of the report of the reverend commissary blair who having projected a college in virginia came to england to ask king william for help the queen in the king s absence ordered her attorney general to draw a charter with a grant of two that they were in a war and needed the money for better purposes but your honor virginia is in great need of ministers said the commissary it has souls to be saved souls damn your souls make tobacco said the queen s lawyer the counselors of royalty have no high opinion of souls or principles think of these taxes on exports needed by neighbors the minds that invented them had the genius of a pickpocket i see that you are not in love with england sir said jack my boy you do not see straight the doctor answered i am fond of england at heart she is sound the king is a kind of wooden leg he has no feeling and no connection whatever with her heart and little with her intellect the people are out of sympathy with the king the best minds in england are directly opposed to the king s policy are helpless he has throttled the voting power of the country jack i have told you all this and shall tell you more because well you know plato said that he would rather be a blockhead than have all knowledge and nobody to share it you ought to know the truth but i have told you only for your own information i am going to write letters to the gazette but i shall not quote you sir without permission said jack at this point the attendant entered and announced that mr thomas paine had called to get his manuscript bring him up said the doctor in a moment a slim dark eyed man of about thirty three in shabby ill fitting garments entered the room doctor franklin shook his hand and gave him a bundle of manuscript and said it is well done but i think it unsound i would not publish it why paine asked with a look of disappointment well it the wind spits in his own face it would be a dangerous book think how great a portion of mankind are weak and ignorant men and women think how many are young and inexperienced and incapable of serious thought they need religion to support their virtue and restrain them from vice if men are so wicked with religion what would they be without it lay the manuscript away and we will have a talk about it later i should like to talk with you about it the man answered with a smile and departed the bundle under his arm now jack said franklin as he looked at his watch i can give you a quarter of an hour before i must go and
to the girl he appeared to thunder dire happenings if she did not obey him without further ado he picked up the broken fiddle and beckoned the sing song girl rose and meekly pattered out of the office into the night ruth crossed over to the dramatist of this tragicomedy and put a hand on his shoulder i understand she said her faith in human beings revived you tried to do something that was fine and and civilization would not let you spurlock turned his dull eyes and tried to focus hers suddenly he burst into wild laughter but equally as suddenly something strangled the sound in his throat he out of the chair to the floor where he lay very still chapter vii the astonishing collapse of spurlock created a tableau of short duration then the hotel manager struck his palms together sharply and two chinese boys came pattering in from the dining room with a gesture which was without any kind of emotional expression the manager indicated the silent crumpled figure on the floor and gave the room number the chinamen raised the limp body and carried it to the hall staircase up which they mounted laboriously a doctor at once cried ruth excitedly a doctor what he needs is a good jolt of aromatic spirits of ammonia i can get that at the bar the manager said curtly he was not particularly grateful for the present situation i warn you if you do not send for a doctor immediately you will have cause to regret it ruth declared vigorously something more than whisky did that why did have it i ca nt stand at the elbow of any of the guests and regulate his or her actions so long as a man behaves himself i ca nt refuse him liquor but i ll call a doctor since you order it you ll be wasting his time it is a plain case of alcoholic stupor i ve seen many cases like it he summoned another boy and rumbled some cantonese immediately the boy went forth with his paper lantern repeating a cry as he ran warning to clear the way have the aromatic spirits of ammonia sent to mr taber s room at once ruth ordered i will administer it you miss enschede frankly astonished that one stranger should offer succour to another there is nobody else someone ought to be with him until the doctor arrives he may die the manager made a negative sign your worry is needless it of his chair it was his heart i once saw a man die after collapsing that way you once saw a man die that way the manager echoed his recent puzzlement returning full tide hartford connecticut she had registered that address but there was something so mystifyingly oriental about her that the address only thickened the haze behind which she moved where that can wait she answered please hurry the ammonia and ruth turned away abruptly above she found the two chinamen squatted at the side of the door they rose as she approached she hastened past she immediately took the pillows from under the head of the man who had two names released the collar and tie and arranged the arms alongside the body his heart was beating but faintly and slowly with ominous intermissions all alone and nobody cared whether he lived or died she was now permitted freely to study the face confusingly new mixed with reality and the loose artistic conceptions of heroes in fiction the young male as she had actually seen him had been of the sailor type hard bitten primordial ruthless for the face under her gaze she could find but one expression fine the shape of the head the height and breadth of the brow the angle of the nose the cut of the chin and jaws all were fine of a type she had never before looked upon closely she saw now that it was not a dissipated face it was as smooth and unlined as polished marble which at present it resembled still something had marked the face something had left an indelible touch perhaps the sunken cheeks and the protruding cheekbones gave her this impression what reassured her however more than anything else was the shape of the mouth it was warmly turned the confirmed drunkard s mouth at length sets itself peculiarly it becomes the mark by which here not a sign of it a drunken idea ah cum had called it and yet it was basically a fine action to buy the freedom of a poor little chinese slave girl for what was the sing song girl but a slave the double slave of custom and of men ruth wanted to know keenly what had impelled the idea had he been trying to stop the grim descent and had he dimly perceived that perhaps a fine deed would serve as the initial barrier a drunken idea a pearl in the midst of a rubbish heap that terrible laughter just before his senses had left him why here was a word that volleyed at her from all directions numbed and bewildered her the multiple echoes of her own first utterance of the word why was nt the world full of love when love made happiness why did people hide their natural kindliness as if it were something shameful why should nt people say what they thought and act as they were neighbour thought when this pother was not energized by any good will why was truth avoided as the plague why did this young man have one name on the hotel register and another on his lips why was she bothering about him at all why should there be this inexplicable compassion when the normal sensation should have been repellance sidney carton was that it had she clothed this unhappy young man with glamour or was it because he was so

of it even to the littlest on this particular afternoon the girls found allen not at the mines as they supposed they would but at the ranch house busy with some papers when they besought him to come out for a ride he hesitated at first saying that he ought to get his work done before night but they finally persuaded him not to let duty interfere with pleasure all right he surrendered at last if you will get one of the boys to saddle lightning for me i will be promise and in a short time was listening to the strangest tale he had ever heard as he listened his face became more and more serious but girls this thing sounds impossible he burst forth finally are you telling me that you alone and unprotected managed to inveigle this murderer into confessing his crime to you gee it s it s unbelievable the four of you would be a great help to me in my profession he added with a chuckle i did nt think you would take it as a joke said betty reproachfully it is nt a joke returned allen his face grave again it s a mighty serious business if you will excuse my saying so it makes me sick when i think of the chance you took he was speaking to all the girls but his look of concern was for betty oh we do nt want to think about we ve done a good deal more dangerous things than that in our lives we thought we hoped you might help us to prove his innocence but the man s guilty said allen surprised we have that by his own confession with a glance of despair at the others betty interrupted him listen to me allen she said this is what i think and she went on to tell him her idea while he listened at first with a smile of faint amusement on his lips which gradually changed to grave admiration as he realized betty s unfailing faith in the basic goodness of human nature i hope you are right little girl he said at last when she had finished and was looking at him earnestly i d like to believe you were right but you ca nt she finished for him trying to stifle the disappointment in her heart no i ca nt he of his crime that he flees his own country gives up money and fame to escape the law you may be pretty sure that his crime was a real one but allen you do nt know the man betty pleaded pretty close to tears in the bitterness of her disappointment no one could make the kind of music he does and be truly wicked i wish you could have met him i think you would have tried a little harder to help him i m willing to help him if i can allen answered gently feeling that he would be almost willing to step into this poor musician s place if he might have betty plead for him as she had just done for the other what is it you would like me to do then suddenly the great idea popped full grown into betty s head i have it she cried why not write to paul loup s manager capital replied allen approvingly while the girls looked at their little captain admiringly if anybody ought to be able to give us information he surely is the one and allen begged betty reining her horse close to allen and laying a timid hand on his arm you wo nt even whisper a word of what we ve told you not for your foolish old law or anything else of course not said allen smiling at her we have to give the poor fellow his chance chapter xxiii great days that very afternoon allen composed a letter to paul loup s concert manager advised and censored by the girls of course and they all rode off to town to mail it in time to catch the four o clock outgoing mail now said mollie as this duty well performed they started back to the ranch i feel better we ve started something anyway let grace dubiously they did not expect an answer to this epistle within ten days and in the meantime they found plenty to keep them busy around the ranch progress at the mines was swift and almost any minute now they might expect to hear the glorious tidings that some one had struck it rich nothing had been seen of peter levine since that memorable night when the map had been taken from him and it was rumored that the rascally lawyer had left town and the longer he keeps away the healthier it will be for him i reckon allen said adding with a laugh gee but it makes me happy every time i think of how sore that chap may be betty had dimpled sympathetically you have an awfully mean disposition allen she chided him meggy and dan higgins were working furiously at their mine but after a few days betty was quick to see that they were not progressing as well as unusually strong and robust for her age was only a girl and her father was an old man who had just about worn out his energies in a fruitless search for fortune betty had besought her father to send help to these good friends of hers and mr nelson had immediately complied there had been some trouble with dan at first with meggy too for that matter we ca nt take nothin thet we ca nt pay fer sir the old fellow assured mr nelson positively but the latter reminded him that he and meggy had saved his daughter s life as well as those of the other girls and that this put him mr nelson deeply in the others debt in
ellen whom he had just seen hey mothey he s ours now gim me the pinchers he took them from ellen s hand and started toward the quill filled kobuk who sensing perhaps a change in his fortunes had risen expectantly to his feet shane entering the to the family the next two hours were spent by the borelands in extracting quills from the repentant kobuk for the first time in his life perhaps the pain racked animal was soothed and cheered during the hated operation by quaint old irish terms of endearment punctuated with advice but there ll be no more porky hunting for you me lad shane assured the dog as he pulled the last quill for the very first fine day we have we re off for the island of kon klayu and divil a thing you ll find there to chase but sand fleas chapter ix harlan wakes up gregg harlan had watched with interest the boreland s preparation for departure to the island of kon klayu for the first time in his life he was doing some serious thinking and ever since the potlatch he had been seeing himself in no complimentary light his chief source of self disgust was his way of taking the information that the borelands including jean wiley thought him a squaw man again to those few moments of silent companionship when he had stood beside the girl in the dusk and watched the funeral canoes come in why had nt he after the white chief told him of his reputed connection with naleenah why had nt he followed jean and explained true the shock and surprise of the thing had momentarily swept him off his feet but why had he in foolish reckless resentment against unjust circumstances rushed off instead to the cabin of kayak bill and taken glass after glass of the stuff that had put him in such a state of oblivion that he was unable to take any part in the potlatch festivities since then he had been too ashamed to approach either of the white women he felt that he must first do something to win their respect during his twenty five years harlan had been a drifter along the pleasant ways of least resistance this was perhaps because he had never been called upon to shoulder responsibility six months before in love he had found himself involved in a foolish but unpleasant financial tangle brought about by a plump perfumed pleasure loving little blonde this small person from an eastern state had made his former knowledge of the hectic night life of san francisco seem but a tuning up of the orchestra before the overture after the inevitable parting of the ways he had found himself obliged to call upon his irate and disgusted father for financial assistance he had done this often before so often that this last episode more scarlet than any of the others brought about a crisis later penniless but debtor to his father only he had departed under a cloud of paternal disapproval to take the position of bookkeeper at faraway katleean it was then that he decided he was through with women at the time he believed it as all men do who make a similar decision but up here in the north he found that a white woman meant more to men than in the states to stand for the cleanness and the decencies of life he found himself longing to be near and speak to these two visiting women of his own kind he had heard of the woman hunger of alaska and recognized in himself the symptoms of that state which causes even the most hardened misogynist to travel a hundred perilous miles merely to look on a white woman s face and hear her voice and music the music of jean s violin drew him like a magnet every evening when she played on the afterdeck of the hoonah he slipped down to the point beyond the indian village and listened listened hungrily with a longing to join her and explain his stupid innocence in connection with the dead naleenah his youth called to hers and he wanted this clean hearted girl to think well of him his drunkenness but of course there was no excuse for that he despised weakness in a man and he had thought a good deal about his own of late the episode of naleenah had brought him face to when he looked at silvertip lolling brutish and drunken on the blankets of his bunk harlan had wondered what alcohol did for the squaw man once he had tried to outline to the one time cook of the sophie sutherland the beauties as he saw them of getting drunk he recalled now his sensations from the moment the alcohol began creeping through his veins softly warmly creating a glow about his heart vistas then opened up before him romance and adventure beckoned him later when the stimulant reached the centers of his brain like the sentient fingers of a musician touching the keyboard of his soul it produced golden harmonies from those keys whose tones are love rhythm color appreciation of the beautiful inhibitions melted away in the amber light that enfolded him lovely things he had read or seen or thought and kept to himself for lack of expression formed themselves into words of exquisite simplicity that were to his ear as pastel shades to the eye other times music that was felt rather than heard swayed him and his feet his hands his whole body longed to dance and interpret this rhythm of the universe afterward came oblivion a sweet forgetting of all unpleasantness a divine sense of mingling without responsibility with the elements but lately he admitted reluctantly to himself even in his moments of keenest alcoholic pleasure he had been aware of an underthought that his exalted mood must pass leaving him more colorless more listless
the creature was of unusual size and presented a broad mark as it chanced the steel went true the devil fish arose to the surface as though hurled upward by a submarine explosion one of its great battle like fins broke above the water sending gallons of spray over the occupants of the boat and splintering the harpoon staff against the boat s side as if it had been a match stem then its ten foot pectoral wing struck the water with a terrific impact making a noise which could have been heard several miles away for a moment the monster seemed bewildered and that moment cost it dear for it enabled bob to throw another harpoon which stuck deep into its body near the spine with a mad dash it started off to sea taking the harpoon lines with it as the lines sped out of their barrels mr choate grasped one and mr giddings the other aided respectively by john and tom and all hands strained they could not be held until at length paul and bob came to the rescue and managed to get the ends around cleats in the boat however this did not stop the devil fish it made out to sea with remarkable speed for so clumsy looking a monster towing the heavy boat and its inmates after it with the ease of a horse pulling a toy carriage as it went all hands bore on the lines adding to its burden but for a long time this seemed to have little or no effect every once in a while the devil fish would literally hurl itself several feet out of the water and its huge flat body would come down with a crack like the explosion of a gun shell perhaps it was imagination but each time it broke the surface in one of these cavortings it seemed to the boys that the fish was bigger than the last time now and then the creature would sound for deep water in an effort to shake its captors off choate stood ready with upraised hatchet to cut the lines at the last moment in the event the bow should show signs of diving under all of a sudden the lines slackened and all hands frantically hauled in slack as the devil fish turned and dashed toward the boat he came up almost under the craft one great wing actually lifting one side of the heavy launch well out of the water and giving everybody a pretty stiff scare with quick presence of mind mr choate at this moment let drive another harpoon which found lodgment in the monster s flat head and away it dashed again with the greatest vigor as there was now a line leading to each side of the devil fish s body those in the motor boat found they were able actually to drive their captive as if it were a runaway horse a gradual bearing on one rein or the other tending to direct the uncertain creature in that direction thus very adroitly they swerved the huge fish toward the now distant shallower waters of the isle by this time the monster had carried them out fully ten miles it had not forgotten its old tactics of deep diving either and there were numerous occasions when after one of these submersions it came up and started fiercely toward the boat and it took the most skillful maneuvering on the part of the steersman as well as wicked use of oars on the part of those in the craft to drive the creature off and keep from being upset they let their anchor drag and at times reversed the propeller hauling on this side and that on the harpoon lines when the devil fish would not be going to suit them in this fashion it was slowly but surely tired out they began to reel in slack line and finally the immense fish was wallowing within twenty feet of the boat surrounded by hungry sharks which had been attracted by its blood it would never do to goad it now by hauling in on the lines as it the waiting sharks could then make a meal of its luckless inmates so mr choate told the boys to use their automatic revolvers and see if they could not dispatch the devil fish at once this was done john tom paul and bob all firing several shots each which put the monster in such a helpless state that they could handle it with less danger to themselves until that moment not one of them realized that nearly five hours had elapsed since they first attacked this jumbo of the sea so busy had they been every moment of the time in trying to conquer the creature and everybody was quite exhausted now that the excitement was over although this fish had three harpoons in his body and a dozen shots in its head and heart it was by no means dead and the fishermen found considerable difficulty in towing it into the harbor some miles away the natives of bimini were greatly interested in the capture and our friends were able to get fifteen of could get a good look at it they were amazed at the unusual size of the devil fish and mr choate declared again that he had never seen such a large one of its kind it measured twenty two feet across and must have weighed close to pounds some people call the octopus a devil fish said mr choate this is all wrong they are both large and vicious creatures but entirely different in looks the devil fish belongs to the ray family and as you see is a huge bat like creature which uses its body fins with a waving undulating motion and propels itself through the water at remarkable speed it is built on the principle of our airplane in looks said tom with a
will be swift he said the way the courage wo nt be oozing out of me yes michael daragh she stood up straight and proud before him waiting for his word back alike on prosperous opulent love and busy and purposeful spinsterhood knowing that happiness for her was the grave young saint whose chief concern would be always for the world s woe richly dowered though she was in body and brain fit for a man s whole devotion she would be content to share him with the submerged with the besmirched and befouled of the earth and at last he was speaking many s the bold boon i ve begged but never the like of this he said his gray eyes holding hers but never the like of this would you could you be dining with a dope fiend it seemed a long time to jane before she worked her hands free of his clasp and heard her voice i do nt believe i understand why would you indeed he cried penitently let you sit down till i m telling you she seated herself in her straight desk chair and dining it sounds rather like a line from a comic song does nt it a lad he is just said daragh earnestly it got hold of him after a sickness in the smooth devil s way it has six months now i m toiling with him times i have him on his feet times he s destroyed again t was a terrible pity i had to be leaving him the while i was home in ireland well i found him doing rare and fine god love him back at his drawing again in the scrap of a studio i found for him but a pitiful tangle of nerves and fancies what he needs now is a friend his own sort some one that speaks his own tongue he thinks the decent world will have none of him a weak pitiful thing is nt worth the saving fair perished with the lonesomeness he is i used to know women he was i miss them the sound of their voices and the look of their white hands and their making tea and the light gay talk we d be having then he sat limp with the grit gone out of him not one of them would come near me now he said holding their skirts away from me passing by on the other side and then may the devil fly away with my tongue jane vail i heard myself saying there s one wo nt be doing that lad there s one the best and fairest and cleverest of them all the wonder worker of the world i said will be putting on her gayest gear and be coming here to make tea talk with you the way you ll think the month of june itself is happened in your studio he stopped looking down at her with anxious eyes jane took her own time about looking at him and when she did it he was still wearing his winter suit this soft spring weather and it wanted pressing and his boots were far from new he stooped a little as he stood there waiting for her verdict as if even the broadest shoulders wearied finally of other people s loads and the line of his zealot s jaw was sharper than ever she felt nothing but scorn for him he had birth breeding abilities why must he wrap himself in monkish sackcloth in monkish celibacy rage rose in her rage and ridicule for herself so this was the man for whom she had dressed herself three times cunningly and provocatively this was the man to whom she had come running with her heart held out in her hands her sane sound hitherto unassailable heart twenty eight years old when he required of her merely a service such as he might ask of any of his settlement workers money from this one work from that one charm and cheer eyes i m doubting i had the right to ask you is it too much indeed jane rose lifting her shoulders ever so slightly the right why surely you re asking me for an hour or so of my time just as you would ask me for a check i am to lift up the light of my countenance on this young gentleman then and convince him that he is still socially desirable i ll be praising you all the long days of my life if you will he said humbly continuing to stand sit down then while i put on my hat she said carelessly quite as she would have spoken to a messenger and moved toward her bedroom door please he took one step after her it s riot but your little brown gown would charm the birds off the bush and it s not that i d be mentioning it or asking it for and her voice was as bright and dry as her eyes one could hardly fancy you asking anything for yourself i would not indeed he said grateful for the exoneration but i m wondering would nt you seem grander to the lad in a a gayer frock perhaps very possibly i would said jane reasonably but i shall have to keep you waiting a little longer then she went into the other room and shut the door slowly and softly to demonstrate the perfect control of her nerves and proceeded to make her fourth toilet for the hour she took her time and did her best which was very good indeed when she put her mind to it and she hummed a snatch of song all the while just loud enough to carry to the study but every time she met her shamed and furious eyes in the glass her face crisped into hotter flame and she stopped singing she kept acquitted her of having
the mountains and knowing he is lost is panic stricken the trail of course he looked for it and there was no trail to his town wise eyes he ran hither and thither and back to hither again he went forward seemingly and found himself back whence he started he looked for cairns for tree blazes for any one of the signs of which he had learned in the last three weeks he terror seized him terror of those grim menacing towering mountain masses he ran round and round and round darted backward and forward called stumbled fell and subsided beaten he had a tiny box of matches with him but little else he had found the trail difficult enough without being pack burdened food he bethought himself of a little blue tin box in his coat pocket he took it out and looked at it its very name struck terror to his heart u s emergency ration it was printed on the box just below that he made out powdered sugar chocolate cocoa butter malted milk egg albumin casein not to be opened except on command of officer my god he had come to this he looked at it wide eyed he was very hungry the ration in its blue tin like a box of shaving talcum had been handed to each of the party in a chorus of shouting and laughter and to pry open the box and ate some of its contents slowly it was not agreeable dusk was coming on there were mountain lions he knew that those rocks and crevices were peopled with all sorts of stealthy snarling slinking four footed creatures he would build a fire they were afraid of the flames he had read somewhere and would not come near perhaps the others would see the light and come back to find him curse them why had nt they come before now it was dusk by the time he had his fire built he had crouched over it for a half hour blowing it coaxing it wheedling it there were few twigs or sticks at this height he was very cold his heavy sweater was in the pack on the horse s back finally he was rewarded with a feeble flicker a tiny tongue of flame he rose from his knees and passed his hand over his forehead with a gesture transfixed for on the plateau above him rose a great shaft of fire the kind of fire that only pete the most expert among guides could build and as he stared there burst out at him from behind trees rocks crevices a whole horde of imps shrieking with fiendish laughter ho ho laughed jessie and ha ha howled the harvard hellions thought you were lost didntcha gosh you looked funny your face florian stared at them he did not smile he went quietly over to his tiny camp fire and stamped it out neatly as he had been taught to do he took his can of emergency ration not to be opened except on command of officer and hurled it far far down the mountainside jessie heath laughed contemptuously and florian looking at her did nt care did nt care did nt care the for florian the rest were to do another four weeks of it farther into the interior florian sickened at the thought of it when he bade them farewell he was so glad to be free of them that he almost loved them when he found himself actually on the little jerkwater train that was to connect him with the main line he patted the dusty red plush seat gratefully as one would stroke a faithful beast when he came into the grand central station he would have stooped and kissed the steps of the marble staircase if his porter had not been on the point of vanishing with his bags that night on reaching home he stayed in the bathtub for an hour just lying there in the warm soothing liquid only moving to dapple his fingers now and then as a lazy fish moves a languid fin god s country this was it my it s nice to have you back again mr sykes said mrs pet said florian cryptically mrs pet stared a little wonderingly yes that s vacant since the ostranders left in july why do you ask mr sykes nothing florian answered airily not a thing just asked his train had come in at nine it was eleven now but he was restless and a little hungry and very much exhilarated you certainly look grand mrs pet had exclaimed admiringly and my how you re sunburned he left the lexington avenue house now and strolled over to the near by white tiled restaurant there in the window was the white capped one flapping pancakes florian could have kissed him he sat down a waitress approached him i do nt know mused florian i m sort of hungry but i do nt just the pork and beans are elegant to night suggested the girl thundered florian the girl drew herself up icily i ai nt deef you do nt need to yell florian looked up at her contritely and smiled his winning smile i m sorry i did nt mean i i never want to see beans again as long as i live he was down at the store early early next morning his practised eye swept the department for possible slackness for changes for needed adjustments the two maine ex guides and the chap who knew the rockies like the palm of his hand welcomed him with judas like slaps on the shoulder like it they asked him and god s country the west he answered mechanically after that he ignored them at nine he ran down the two flights of stairs to the third floor he did not wait for the elevator for a moment he could not find her and his heart
him go back to palestine or to the country that oppressed him i say i ve got the same amount of patience with these hyphenated americans as i have with the jews who try to segregate themselves and dot the map with new jerusalems where s the sense in throwing yourself into the melting pot glad of the chance and then kicking bed dear you are as pale as a ghost and i m so tired i ca nt see straight our baby is all right do nt you worry snow falls on the just and the unjust there was quite as much of it in hannah s back yard as in either virginia s or nellie s perhaps even a little more had drifted into the fence corners hannah s joy in discovering that in this respect she had not been slighted crowded her troubles into the background immediately after breakfast bundled up snugly she stood in her yard and threw snowballs toward her neighbors homes while she squealed with delight in a very few minutes three little girls were playing where only one had played before the two newcomers virginia lawrence and nellie halloran presented an interesting contrast virginia slim and tall for her age with long flat yellow braids handled the snow daintily even gingerly nellie fat and rolled over and over in the snow and then shook herself like a puppy until the advent of hannah a subtle antagonism had existed between the two children virginia s favorite game was playing lady with a train floating gracefully behind her nellie s chief joy in life was seeing how long she could stand on her head her short skirts obeying the laws of gravity all the while hannah however vibrated obligingly between the two sports and kept the peace inviolate romping in the snow is hard play and presently the little girls sat panting on the top step of the josephs back porch immediately nellie produced a string of amethyst colored beads from her coat pocket with the announcement that she would say her prayers while resting what kind of beads are those asked hannah rosary beads course responded nellie hannah you do nt know anything i do too huh god until i told you i reckon i thought god was an orphan hannah pleaded in extenuation but what about god s papa she demanded with sudden inspiration you re so smarty tell me about that oh god did nt have to have a father nellie answered easily everything is free in heaven so he did nt have to have a father to work for him when he was little then why did he have to have a mama to tell him what to do course you know how t is if you ask your papa anything do nt he always say go ask your mama hannah had noticed this shifting of masculine responsibility more than once that s so she acquiesced then a terrible thought struck her i do nt want to go to heaven i do nt want to go anywhere unless irish wits were ready i just said god did nt need any papa course our papas will go to heaven cause that s the only place they can quit working did nt i hear my papa say one time he hoped he d get a little rest in heaven cause he never got any on this earth but you have to die before you can get to heaven sighed hannah virginia who had been maintaining a most dignified silence looked as if she must speak or explode no you do nt heaven begins here and now she recited if you are good you are well and happy and that s heaven tis nt scoffed nellie do you see any angels flying round in this here yard i do nt hannah rather took to virginia s argument and resolved to have conversation with her some time undampened by nellie s skepticism heaven here and now hannah had every intention of being at the banquet table at the present moment however the rosary beads were of fascinating interest she must hold them in her own hands and watch the play of purple lights upon the snow as she flashed them in the sun questions about the crucifix she found brought on an embarrassing silence nellie looked at virginia virginia looked at nellie then the two excused themselves for a whispered colloquy at the other end of the yard when they returned virginia acted as spokesman fixing nellie with an unrelenting eye that is jesus nailed to the cross hannah some very wicked people did it there was nothing exciting in this to hannah wicked people were doing wicked things the world over all the time the statement fell flat and nellie disappointed at the lack of dramatic effect broke treaty i spect the jews did it she said they the jews are nice people they would nt do a wicked thing like that virginia put an arm across hannah s shoulders now see what you ve done she snapped at nellie oh i spect the irish helped them nellie added magnanimously my papa says the irish are into every thing not having to bear the ignominy alone hannah was comforted what makes you say prayers on the beads she asked cause i want santy to bring me a doll to night i wrote him bout sixteen letters and i m going to say my rosary a dozen times to day to morrow was christmas day hannah s face fell all her sorrows returned with a rush

skins to furnish stuff for my buckskin shirt with the beautiful long fringes at the seams but the whole garment was cut sewed and finished in a day s time it was sewed with thread made of sinew when it came to making the coat and trousers big pete spent a long time in solemn thought before he was ready looked up with a broad smile and cried see here le loo i have taken a fancy to them ere tenderfut pants o your n off with em now an i ll jist cut out the new ones from the old uns in vain i pleaded with him to make my trousers like his own he would not listen to me he insisted upon having my ragged but stylish knickerbockers to use as a pattern chapter x big pete was an expert backwoods tailor shoemaker and shirtmaker but these were but few of his accomplishments not his trade he was first last and aways a hunter and scout no matter what occupation seemed to engage his attention for the time it never interfered with his ability to hear see or smell it was while i was going around camp minus my lower garments that i saw pete suddenly throw up his head and suspiciously sniff the air at the same time sharply scanning the windward side of our camp with his actions and quick to detect anything unusual and i now knew that something of interest had happened to the windward and close by us was a mound thickly covered with bullberry bushes and underbrush and so far as could be seen there was nothing suspicious in the appearance of the thicket fixing my eyes on big pete i saw a peculiar expression spread over his face which seemed to be half of mirth and half of wonderment and i immediately knew that his wonderful nose had warned him of the presence of something to the windward slowly and quietly he laid aside my almost finished breeches and silently stole away it was only a few minutes before he returned with a very solemn face doggone my corn shucked bones le loo we ve had a visitor but it got away mighty slick and quick i hai nt determint yit whether it wa man er beast er both er jist a thing wha might change into tother we ll hafter investigate later here my new elk hide knickerbockers with cuffs of dressed buckskin laced around my calves and my beautiful soft buckskin shirt tucked in at the waist i began to feel like a real nimrod but after i added my moo loch capo the shooting jacket with elk teeth buttons pulled a pair of shank moccasins over my feet and donned a cap made of lynx skin i was as happy as a child with its christmas stocking it was a really wonderful suit of clothing the hair of the elk hide was on the outside and not only made the coat and breeches warmer but helped to shed the rain the buttons of the elk teeth were fastened on with thongs run through holes in their centers and my coat could be laced up after the fashion of a military overcoat the elk s teeth served as frogs and loops of rawhide answered for the braid that is used on military coats my shank moccasins were made by first making a cut around each of the hind legs of an elk enough for boot legs and making another cut far enough below the heels to make room for one s feet the fresh skins when peeled off looked like rude stockings with holes at the toes the skins were turned wrong side out and the open toes closed by bringing the lower part or sole up over the opening and sewing it there after the manner of a tip to the modern shoe when this novel foot gear was dry enough for the purpose big pete ornamented the legs with quaint colored designs made with split porcupine quills colored with dyes which pete himself had manufactured of roots and barks dressed in my unique and picturesque costume i stood upright while pete surveyed me with the pride and satisfaction of one who had done a fine piece of work i had now little fear of being called a tenderfoot and when i viewed my reflection in the spring i felt quite proud of my appearance come along now old scout said pete viewing me with the pride of an artist a real trail i want to see what my teaching has done for you pete led me through the underbrush to a point among the rocks tha a trail begins right under yore nose let s see what you make of it he said crisply down on all fours i crept over the ground and to my surprise and joy i found that i could here and there detect a turned leaf the twist of which indicated the direction taken by the party who made the trail i noticed that the bits of wood pine cones and sticks scattered around were darker on the parts next to the ground and it only required simple reasoning for me to conclude that when the dark side was uppermost the object had been recently disturbed and rolled over it was a day of great discoveries i found that what is true of the sticks is equally true of the pebbles and a displaced fragment of stone immediately caught my eyes with the tenacity of a myself at the base of the park wall at the foot of the diagonal fracture in the face of the cliff where i had climbed when i discovered the golden trout as i have said the fracture led diagonally up the towering face of the beetling precipice for fear that i might have made some mistake i carefully retraced my steps backward toward the bullberry bushes

the beginning of the undoing of mike clinch from esthonia a refugee countess wrote to james darragh in new york after two years we have discovered that it was jose quintana s band of international thieves that robbed ricca quintana has disappeared a levantine diamond broker in new york named emanuel sard may be in communication with him ricca and i are going to america as soon as possible valentine the day darragh received the letter he started to look up sard but that very morning sard had received a curious letter from rotterdam this was the letter sardius tourmaline aragonite

crucifer abalone turkish turquoise old mine stone natrolite cats eye electrum a a that afternoon young darragh located sard s office and presented himself as a customer the weasel faced clerk behind the wicket laid a pistol handy and informed darragh that sard was away on a business trip darragh looked cautiously around the small office can anybody hear us nobody why i have important news concerning jose quintana whispered darragh where is sard why he had a letter from quintana this very morning replied mr sard left for albany on the one o clock train is there any trouble plenty replied darragh coolly do you know quintana no but mr sard expects him here any day now darragh leaned closer against the grille listen very carefully if a man comes here who calls himself jose quintana turn him over to the police until mr sard returns no matter what he tells you turn him over to the police do you understand who are you demanded the worried clerk are you one of quintana s people young man said darragh i m close enough to quintana to give you orders and give sard orders and quintana too a great light dawned on the scared clerk you are jose quintana he said hoarsely darragh bored him through with his dark stare mind your business he said up sard s trail it led to a dealer in automobiles sard had bought a comet six paying cash and had started north through schenectady fonda and mayfield the following day darragh traced a brand new comet six containing one short dark levantine with a parrot nose in northville darragh hired a ford at lake pleasant sard s car went wrong darragh missed him by ten minutes but he learned that sard had inquired the way to ghost lake inn that was sufficient darragh bought an axe drove as far as harrod s corners dismissed the ford and walked into a forest entirely familiar to him he emerged in half an hour on a wood road two miles farther on here he felled a tree across the road and sat down in the bushes to await events toward sunset hearing a car coming he tied his handkerchief over his face below the eyes and took an automatic from his pocket sard s car stopped and out of the bushes poked his pistol against mr sard s fat abdomen and leisurely and thoroughly robbed him in an agreeable spot near a brook darragh lighted his pipe and sat him down to examine the booty in detail two pistols a stiletto and a blackjack composed the arsenal of mr sard a large wallet disclosed more than four thousand dollars in treasury notes something to reimburse ricca when she arrived he thought among sard s papers he discovered a cipher letter from rotterdam probably from quintana cipher was rather in darragh s line all ciphers are solved by similar methods unless the key is contained in a code book known only to sender and receiver but quintana s cipher proved to be only an easy acrostic
i see excellent possibility in you perform the duties punctually in this very lowly office and high ranks of service in the church militant will be open he put on a very fine shovel hat and led the way to his large touring car it was a very uncomfortable ride for gissing a silk hat is the least stable apparel for swift motoring and the chauffeur drove at high speed the bishop leaning back in the gazed in a kind of ecstasy at the countryside and talked gaily about his days as a young curate gissing sat holding his hat on he saw only too well that by the humiliating oddity of chance they were going to take the road that led exactly past his own house he could only hope that mrs spaniel and the various children would not be visible for explanations would be too complicated desperately he praised the view to be obtained on another road but bishop borzoi was too interested in his own topic to pay much attention by the way said the latter as they drew near the familiar region i must introduce you to miss airedale she lives in the big place on the hill over there her family always used to attend what i will now call your chapel she is a very ardent churchgoer and it was a sincere grief to her when the place had to be closed you will find her a great aid what one does not always find in the devouter members of her sex young and beautiful i think i understood you to say you are a bachelor they were approaching the last turning at which it was still possible to avoid the fatal road and gissing s attention was divided yes after a fashion he replied bishop do you know that road down into the valley the view is really superb yes that road oh no i am a bachelor it was too late the chauffeur unconscious of this private crisis was spinning along the homeward way with a tender emotion gissing saw the spires of the poplar trees the hemlocks down beyond the pond the fringe of woods that concealed the house until you were quite upon it the car swerved suddenly and the driver only saved it by a quick and canny manoeuvre from going down the bank he came to a stop and almost from underneath the rear been playing in the road there they were bunks groups and yelpers inordinately grown and two of the spaniels their clothes were deplorable their faces grimed their legs covered with burrs their whole demeanour was ragamuffin and wild yet gissing felt a pang of pride to see his godchildren s keen independent bearing contrasted with the rowdier disreputable look of the young spaniels quickly he averted his head to escape recognition but the urchins were all gaping at the bishop s shovel hat hot dog cried yelpers some hat to his horror gissing now saw mrs spaniel hastening in alarm down from the house spilling potatoes from her apron as she ran he hurriedly urged the driver to proceed what terrible looking children observed the bishop who seemed fascinated by their stare really my good sister he said to mrs spaniel who was now panting by the running board you must gissing was looking for an imaginary object on the floor of the car to his great relief he heard the roar of the motor as they started again but he sat up a little too soon a simultaneous roar of daddy burst from the trio what was that they were shouting at us inquired the bishop looking back gissing shook his head he was too overcome to speak chapter eleven the little chapel at dalmatian heights sat upon a hill among a grove of pines the most romantic of all trees life a powerful but clumsy dramatist does not reject the most claptrap situations which a sophisticated playwright would discard as too obvious for this sandy plateau strewn with satiny pine needles was the very horizon that had looked so blue and beckoning from the little house by the pond not far away was the great airedale estate which gissing had known only at an admiring distance and now he was living him to call upon the airedales and they delighted that the chapel was to be re opened had insisted upon his staying with them the chapel in fact was a special interest with mr airedale who had been a leading contributor toward its erection gissing was finding that life seemed to be continually putting him into false positions and now he discovered somewhat to his chagrin that the lovely little shrine of st spitz whose stained windows glowed like rubies in its cloister of dark trees was rather a fashionable hobby among the wealthy landowners of dalmatian hills it had been closed all summer and they had missed it the bishop in his airy and indefinite way had not made it quite plain that gissing was only a lay reader and in spite of his embarrassed disclaimers he found himself introduced by mr airedale to the country house clique as the new vicar but at any rate it was lucky that the airedales had insisted on taking him in as just as the latter was leaving that there was no stipend attached to the office of lay reader fortunately he still had much of the money he had saved from his salary as general manager and whatever sense of anomaly he felt was quickly assuaged by the extraordinary comfort and novelty of his environment in the great airedale mansion he experienced for the first time that ultimate triumph of civilization a cup of tea served in bed before breakfast with slices of bread and butter of tenuous and amazing fragile thinness he was pleased too with the deference paid him as a representative of the cloth even though it compelled him
stealthily approaching the agent s office across the street taking advantage of the deeper shadows and of the darkness between lightning flashes she stole to the rear of the building where she found an unlatched window through which she scrambled with the agility of a boy within the place was pitch dark but like one amid familiar surroundings she crossed the hall and found the room she sought the office room now of moran but formerly occupied by simon barsdale she bent over the big safe and was twirling the combination knob in her slim cold fingers when she with a gasp of fright she stood motionless listening acutely but there was no further sound reassured she produced a bit of candle which she lighted and placed to one side of the safe so that the flame was shaded from the windows she was in the act of manipulating the combination again when her whole body rigid with fear she stood erect once more holding her breath and striving for self control there was no doubt about the noise this time some one had entered the adjoining room hastily snuffing out the candle she crouched into the darkness of a corner she never doubted that the newcomer was race moran or that he would almost immediately discover her she tried to summon enough resolution to bluff things through when the moment of discovery should come but as the seconds slipped by and the lights were not turned on she began to regain her courage perhaps moran was sitting in the dark of the other room smoking and thinking caught if she moved swiftly and silently she bent again over the shining knob at the same time watching in the direction of the door which was still closed as she had left it it was difficult to work the lock in the dark and as she became engrossed with her purpose she ceased temporarily to listen acutely she had just succeeded in effecting the combination when something touched her side do nt move a voice hissed behind her i ll shoot if you do she wanted to cry out please do nt shoot but her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth which had suddenly gone dry she had fallen forward against the door of the safe and was curiously conscious how cold it felt she was on the point of fainting when in a rush of relief it dawned upon her that she knew the voice it was not moran s gordon she cried joyously had lost it and scrambling to her feet it s me dorothy with an exclamation as joyous as her own and equally surprised he seized her by the shoulders peering through the darkness into her face dorothy what the a lightning flash revealed them clearly to each other i told you not to try this but what are you doing in town she clutched his arms overcome by a fear greater than that for her own safety gordon gordon you must not stay here there s a warrant out for you no no not for that for the jensen shooting you ll be arrested on sight what he stared at her amazed and she nodded so that s their game now eh they ve stooped even to that by god he struck a match be careful she warned him instantly see it from the street but oh gordon why did you come he thrilled at the anxiety in her voice to find out what moran is hiding here and you re after the same thing of course yes impulsively he squeezed her fingers until she could have cried out in pain but for the sweetness of it there are some agonies which do not hurt her throat swelled with joy her breast heaved and her eyelids fluttered she was grateful for the darkness which hid these outward signs of love from him she blushed she could feel the warm tide pulsing in her temples and she laughed brokenly from sheer happiness you should nt have taken such a risk dorothy i told you not to you re taking that risk gordon and more that s different it s so dark a night i thought i d chance it declared i can reach home in five minutes is nt it odd though that we both should have thought of doing it at exactly the same time but come gordon we must hurry now that the safe was open to remove its contents took only a moment and they tossed all the papers they found into a corner then when wade had swung the safe around on its casters they had a snug shelter behind it where by shaded candle light they ran rapidly through their loot most of the documents related to land purchases and development but at the bottom of the pile wade came upon a bundle of papers and blue prints held together by a rubber band which he stripped off oh if we should find nothing after all dorothy whispered bending with him over the blue prints what are they gordon maps of my own range dorothy his tone was tense with excitement what do you know about that by heaven he fairly glared at the sheet before his eyes it s all there what s all there what is it gold he looked at her in the flickering light like a man gone mad gold on your range oh gordon yes on my range it s inconceivable almost but it seems to be true see look here their heads were almost touching so that her soft hair caressed his face this is a map of the upper valley and the description says these red crosses indicate the location of gold one is near the head of piah creek not half a mile from my buildings oh gordon i am so glad dorothy exclaimed how wonderful it all is you ll be
the boy s toes detected something and he did a pretty surface dive emerging with the bag strap in his right hand he also rescued the floating driver and we saw the promised bill passed to him and watched him drag on his clothes over his wet undergarments slowly even tenderly the somewhat elderly gentleman emptied the water and the stone from his bag and wiped the clubs on his handkerchief with the wet dripping burden over his shoulder he came across the foot bridge and into the locker room while we hastened to remove our faces from the door and windows and attempted to appear casual he entered in silence and strode to his locker the silence grew painful somebody simply had to speak or laugh finally somebody did speak which was probably the safer alternative decided to try again eh the somewhat elderly gentleman wheeled upon the assemblage yes damn it he thundered well i have never thrown my clubs into a pond and i am sure you have never done anything so childish either but how many times have you and i both given up golf forever and then returned to links the following day damn it we do not play for the exercise we do not play because it keeps us out in the open air neither motive would hold a man for a week to the tantalizing costly soul racking nerve and temper destroying game we play it because there is some diabolical or celestial fascination about the thing some will o the wisp of hope lures us over swamp and swale through pit and pasture toward the smooth haven of the putting green some subtle mysterious power every now and then coordinates our muscles and lets us achieve perfection for a single stroke whereafter we tingle with remembrance and thrill with anticipation golf is the quest of unrest it spreads before us the soft green pathway down which we follow the gleam that is why you and i shall be giving it up forever on our eightieth birthday illustration grape vine erudition you may recall that mr ezra barkley acquired a great reputation for learning by imparting to the spinsters of old chester such astonishing facts as the approximate number of roe contained in a shad his sister in law in her ignorance supposed there were only two hundred ezra also knew who first kept bees and many other important things usually of a statistical nature i can not recall that mrs deland has told us where ezra acquired his erudition and i used at one time to wonder but now i know he read the grape vine in the first editions of our daily papers perhaps you do nt know what grape vine is i rejoice in my ability to tell you it is the name given by newspaper men to the jokes and squibs and bits of information clipped making short paragraphs of varying lengths which are dropped in at the bottom of a column to fill up the vacant space when the need arises this need most often arises in preparing the first edition the one which catches the early trains for the country by the time the city edition goes to press sufficient news of battles carnage and sudden death of politics and stock exchanges has been prepared to fill every inch of available space the city reader therefore sees little of this grape vine thus we have a new argument for country life i am now a resident of the country one hundred and fifty miles removed from new york and as far from boston and i am by way of becoming nearly as erudite as ezra barkley i am indeed almost bewildered with the mass of information i am acquiring this morning i read a column about the european war all of which i have now forgotten but how can i ever forget bottom which filled out an otherwise vacant quarter inch i am permanently a wiser man many filipino women catch and sell fish for a living amid a world at war too how peaceful and soothing is this tabloid idyl of piscatorial toil after the acquisition of this morsel of learning i set diligently to work on the day s papers both the morning editions and those evening editions which come to us here by a train leaving the city early in the afternoon to see how much erudition i could accumulate in one sun s span i think you of the cities will be astonished i was myself in a few weeks i shall read the encyclopaedia advertisements with scorn instead of longing for instance i have learned that a new tooth brush is cylindrical and is revolved against the teeth by a plunger working through its spirally grooved handle obviously just the implement for boys interested in motor cars as all boys are they will play they are i have learned that in the last five years our national and state lawmaking bodies have passed laws the surprising thing about this information is that the number is so small i have learned that russia has ten thousand lepers taken care of by twenty one institutions i have acquired these valuable bits of ornithological lore the frigate bird is capable of getting up a speed of ninety six miles an hour with hardly a movement of its wings the greater part of its life is spent in the air the swallow has a larger mouth in proportion to its size than any other bird i have from the bottom of a single column gleaned these three items of incalculable value by harnessing a fly to a tiny wagon an english scientist found it could draw one hundred and seventy times its own weight over smooth surfaces missouri last year produced tons of lead a fairly heavy output the united states has five hundred and with this statistical line one paris motion picture plant produces an
did the smirk and smile of the ticket agent your pardon madam i proffered lifting my hat agreeably dazzled while thus performing she acknowledged the tribute with a faint blush while pocketing my change and stowing away my ticket i had opportunity to survey her further benton she said briefly to the agent we were bound for the same point then ye gods but she was a little beauty a perfect blonde of the petite and fully formed type with regular features inclined to the clean cut grecian a piquant mouth deliciously bowed two eyes a mass of glinting golden hair upon which perched a ravishing little bonnet the natural ensemble was enhanced by her costume all of black from the closely fitting bodice to the rustling crinoline beneath which there peeped out tiny shoes i had opportunity also to note the jet pendant in the shelly ear toward me and the flashing rings upon the fingers of her hands ungloved in order to sort out the money from her reticule sooth to say i might not stand there gawking once by a demure sideways glance she betrayed knowledge of my presence her own transaction was all matter of fact as if engaging passage to benton of wyoming territory contained no novelty for her could she by any chance live there a woman dressed like she was as much a la mode as if she walked broadway in new york omaha itself had astonished me with the display upon its streets and now if benton far out in the wilderness should prove another surprise indeed all strange to say as soon as one crossed the missouri river one began to sense romance and to discover it as seemed to me the ticket agent would have detained her in defiance of the waiting line but she finished her business shortly with shorter replies to his idle remarks and i turned away under pretense of examining some placards upon the wall advertising platte valley lands for sale i had curiosity to see which way she wended then as she tripped for the door casting eyes never right nor left and still fumbling at her reticule a coin slipped from her fingers and rolled by good fortune across the floor i was after it instantly caught it and with best bow presented it permit me madam she took it thank you sir for a moment she paused to restore it to its company and i grasped the occasion i beg your pardon you are eyes met mine so completely as well nigh to daze me with their glory there was a quizzical uplift in her frank arch smile i am sir to benton city of wyoming territory you are acquainted there i ventured yes sir i am acquainted there and you are from benton oh no i assured i am from new york state as if anybody might not have known but i have just purchased my ticket to benton and i stammered i have made bold to wonder if you would not have the goodness to tell me something of the place as to accommodations and all that you do nt by any chance happen to live there do you and why not sir may i ask she challenged i floundered before her query direct and her bewildering eyes and lips all tantalizing i territory has been mentioned in the newspapers as largely indian country at benton we are only six days behind new york fashions she smiled you have not been out over the railroad then i suspect not to north platte nor to cheyenne i have never been west of cincinnati before you have surely been reading of the railroad the pacific railway between the east and california yes indeed in fact a friend of mine named stephen clark nephew of the honorable thurlow weed formerly of albany was killed a year ago by your indians while surveying west of the black hills and of course there have been accounts in the new york papers you are not on survey service or possibly yes no madam a pleasure trip to end of track she evidently was curious but i was getting accustomed to questions into private matters that pleasure of finding health i laughed i have been advised to seek a location high and dry oh she dimpled adorably i congratulate you on your choice you will make no mistake then in trying benton i can promise you that it is high and reasonably dry and as for accommodations so far as i have ever heard anybody is accommodated there with whatever he may wish she darted a glance at me stepped aside as if to leave i am to understand that it is a city i pleaded benton why certainly all the world is flowing to benton we gained three thousand people in two weeks much to the sorrow of poor old cheyenne and laramie no doubt there are five thousand people there now and all busy yes a young man will find his opportunities in benton i think your choice will please you money is plentiful and so are me another sparkling glance and since we are both going to benton i will say au revoir sir she left me quivering you do live there i besought after and received a nod of the golden head as she entered the sacred ladies waiting room until the train should be made up i might only stroll restless and strangely buoyed with that vision of an entrancing fellow traveler filling my eyes summoned in due time by the clamor passengers for the pacific railway all aboard going west on the union pacific here amidst the platform hurly burly of men women children and bundles i had the satisfaction to sight the black clad figure of my lady of the blue eyes hastening like the rest but not unattended for a brakeman bore her valise and the conductor her parasol the
explained these men will return at once to hooja s island to the mahar cities from which they come or to the countries from which they were stolen by the mahars they are men of two races and of many countries they will spread the story of our victory far and wide and while they are with us we will they may carry back to their friends and their chiefs it s the finest chance for free publicity perry i added to the old man that you or i have seen in many a day perry agreed with me as a matter of fact he would have agreed to anything that would have restrained us from killing the poor devils who fell into our hands he was a great fellow to invent gunpowder and fire arms and cannon but when it came to using these things to kill people he was as tender hearted as a chicken the sagoth who had spoken was talking to other sagoths in his boat evidently they were holding a council over the question of the wisdom of surrender ing what will become of you if you do nt surrender to us i asked if we do not open up our batteries on you again and kill you all you will simply drift about the sea helplessly until you die of thirst and starvation you can as well as we that the natives there are very numerous and warlike they would kill you the moment you landed the upshot of it was that the boat of which the sagoth speaker was in charge surrendered the sagoths threw down their weapons and we took them aboard the ship next in line behind the amoz first ja had to impress upon the captain and crew of the ship that the prisoners were not to be abused or killed after that the remaining dugouts paddled up and surrendered we distributed them among the entire fleet lest there be too many upon any one vessel thus ended the first real naval engagement that the pellucidarian seas had ever witnessed though perry still insists that the action in which the sari took part was a battle of the first magnitude the battle over and the prisoners disposed of and fed and do not imagine that dian juag and i as well as the two hounds were not fed also i turned my attention to the fleet we had the feluccas close of a medieval potentate on parade i received the commanders of the forty nine feluccas that accompanied the flag ship dian and i together the empress and the emperor of pellucidar it was a great occasion the savage bronze warriors entered into the spirit of it for as i learned later dear old perry had left no opportunity neglected for impressing upon them that david was emperor of pellucidar and that all that they were accomplishing and all that he was accomplishing was due to the power and redounded to the glory of david the old man must have rubbed it in pretty strong for those fierce warriors nearly came to blows in their efforts to be among the first of those to kneel before me and kiss my hand when it came to kissing dian s i think they enjoyed it more i know i should have a happy thought occurred to me as i stood upon the little deck of the amoz with the first of perry s primi tive cannon behind me when ja kneeled at my feet and first at his side the sword of hammered iron that perry had taught him to fashion striking him lightly on the shoulder i created him king of anoroc each captain of the forty nine other feluccas i made a duke i left it to perry to enlighten them as to the value of the honors i had bestowed upon them during these ceremonies raja and ranee had stood beside dian and me their bellies had been well filled but still they had difficulty in permitting so much edible humanity to pass unchallenged it was a good education for them though and never after did they find it difficult to associate with the human race with out arousing their appetites after the ceremonies were over we had a chance to talk with perry and ja the former told me that ghak king of sari had sent my letter and map to him by a runner and that he and ja had at once decided to set out on the completion of the fleet to ascertain the correctness of my theory that the was in reality the same ocean as that which lapped the shores of thuria under the name of sojar az or great sea their destination had been the island retreat of hooja and they had sent word to ghak of their plans that we might work in harmony with them the tempest that had blown us off the coast of the continent had blown them far to the south also shortly before discovering us they had come into a great group of islands from between the largest two of which they were sailing when they saw hooja s fleet pursuing our dugout i asked perry if he had any idea as to where we were or in what direction lay hooja s island or the continent he replied by producing his map on which he had carefully marked the newly discovered islands there described as the unfriendly isles which showed hooja s island northwest of us about two points west he then explained that with compass chronometer log and reel they had kept a fairly accurate record of their of the feluccas were equipped with these instruments and all of the captains had been instructed in their use i was very greatly surprised at the ease with which these savages had mastered the rather intricate detail of this unusual work but perry assured me that they
had already gone through enough to kill almost any woman and as i gazed down at her so small and delicate and helpless there was born slowly within my breast a new emotion it had never been there before now it will never cease to be there it made me almost frantic in my desire to find some way to keep warm and cooling lifeblood in her veins i was cold myself though i had almost forgotten it until nobbler moved and i felt a new sensation of cold along my leg against which he had lain and suddenly realized that in that one spot i had been warm like a great light came the understanding knelt beside her to put my scheme into practice when suddenly i was overwhelmed with embarrassment would she permit it even if i could muster the courage to suggest it then i saw her frame convulse shudderingly her muscles reacting to her rapidly lowering temperature and casting prudery to the winds i threw myself down beside her and took her in my arms pressing her body close to mine she drew away suddenly voicing a little cry of fright and tried to push me from her forgive me i managed to stammer it is the only way you will die of exposure if you are not warmed and nobs and i are the only means we can command for furnishing warmth and i held her tightly while i called nobs and bade him lie down at her back the girl did nt struggle any more when she learned my purpose but she gave two or three little gasps and then began to cry softly burying her chapter toward morning i must have dozed though it seemed to me at the time that i had lain awake for days instead of hours when i finally opened my eyes it was daylight and the girl s hair was in my face and she was breathing normally i thanked god for that she had turned her head during the night so that as i opened my eyes i saw her face not an inch from mine my lips almost touching hers it was nobs who finally awoke her he got up stretched turned around a few times and lay down again and the girl opened her eyes and looked into mine hers went very wide at first and then slowly comprehension came to her and she smiled you have been very good to me she said as i helped her to rise though if the truth were known i was more in need of assistance than she the circulation all along my left been very good to me and that was the only mention she ever made of it yet i know that she was thankful and that only reserve prevented her from referring to what to say the least was an embarrassing situation however unavoidable shortly after daylight we saw smoke apparently coming straight toward us and after a time we made out the squat lines of a tug one of those fearless exponents of england s supremacy of the sea that tows sailing ships into french and english ports i stood up on a thwart and waved my soggy coat above my head nobs stood upon another and barked the girl sat at my feet straining her eyes toward the deck of the oncoming boat they see us she said at last there is a man answering your signal she was right a lump came into my throat for her sake rather than for mine she was saved and none too soon she could not have lived through another night upon coming day the tug came close beside us and a man on deck threw us a rope willing hands dragged us to the deck nobs scrambling nimbly aboard without assistance the rough men were gentle as mothers with the girl plying us both with questions they hustled her to the captain s cabin and me to the boiler room they told the girl to take off her wet clothes and throw them outside the door that they might be dried and then to slip into the captain s bunk and get warm they did nt have to tell me to strip after i once got into the warmth of the boiler room in a jiffy my clothes hung about where they might dry most quickly and i myself was absorbing through every pore the welcome heat of the stifling compartment they brought us hot soup and coffee and then those who were not on duty sat around and helped me damn the kaiser and his brood as soon as our clothes were dry they bade than fair in those waters that we should run into trouble with the enemy as i was only too well aware what with the warmth and the feeling of safety for the girl and the knowledge that a little rest and food would quickly overcome the effects of her experiences of the past dismal hours i was feeling more content than i had experienced since those three whistle blasts had shattered the peace of my world the previous afternoon but peace upon the channel has been but a transitory thing since august it proved itself such that morning for i had scarce gotten into my dry clothes and taken the girl s apparel to the captain s cabin when an order was shouted down into the engine room for full speed ahead and an instant later i heard the dull boom of a gun in a moment i was up on deck to see an enemy submarine about two hundred yards off our port bow she had signaled us to stop and our skipper had ignored the order but the second shot grazed the cabin warning the belligerent tug captain that it was time to obey once again an order went down to the engine room and the tug
to be diverted by something and one of them my friend harry bolles who had his handkerchief up to his mouth made a bee line to meet me from his lips i learned what pot hunter having presently pulled a solitary pickerel out upon the ice and freed it from his hook turned aside to cut another piece of bait whereupon my hopeful picked up the fish and popped it back into its native element without so much as a syllable of commentary and thereupon being act three in the tragedy he of the horny hand having realized the situation in its terrible entirety pulled up his line shovelled back the particles of ice into the hole and betook himself upon his shambling way without one word not a word mark you there was a real philosopher if you like a thorough going square trotting philosopher the only alternative was child murder or silence and my pot hunter chose the simplest form of the dilemma i thought the fish would like it said little fred when interrogated upon the subject and yet despite my occasional inability to practice what i preach josephine is correct in her diagnosis that my cast of mind is becoming more i am the author of four children two strapping sons and two tall daughters anyone of whom may constitute me a grandfather before i am fifty renders me conservative and disposed metaphorically speaking to draw in my horns a little i am beginning to go to church again for instance you may have taken it for granted that i have been regular in my attendance at the sanctuary certainly i have never been a scoffer but on the other hand i must confess that somehow it has come to pass since josephine and i plighted our troth that our pew has stood empty on the lord s day oftener than the orthodox consider fitting and the worst of it is i used to attend service about every other sabbath before i became a benedict and josephine taught a sunday school class up to within six months of our wedding ceremony she dear girl has harbored ever since the belief that she continues to go to church almost every sunday either in the morning or i took no pains to dispel knowing as i did that she meant to go every sunday yet i knew also that pitiless unemotional statistics would reveal an average attendance on her part of rather less than ten times in the course of each year i was brute enough finally to call attention to a tally sheet covering a period of three calendar months which i had kept for my private edification and i was punished by seeing her sweet eyes fill with tears before she proceeded to plead to the indictment you know fred perfectly well that i have to stay at home with the children every other sunday morning in order to allow lucille to go to church but how about the other mornings and all the afternoons i inquired with the effrontery of a hardened sinner seizing his opportunity to take a saint to task josephine blushed partly from guilt and partly from indignation it rained torrents last sunday morning and sunday morning fortnight er i was sick afternoon when old mr philipps called and i did nt like to leave him besides i feel as though i ought to stay at home occasionally on sunday afternoons in order to teach the children the scriptures the sunday morning before that er i went no it must have been a fortnight previous for i recollect now that i had planned to go when you said that you hated to skate alone and declined to take the entire responsibility of the children on the pond on account of little fred and the pickerel and i said too i remember that in all probability there would nt be black ice again all winter you did you did my darling cried with tragic impetuosity and it is cruel of you to remind me of it moreover it was a correct prophecy it snowed that very night and the people who waited until monday were nowhere oh fred fred i m a wicked who ought to tax me with it but it is true i do nt go to church as i ought and yet i do mean to go but if it is nt one thing which prevents it s another lucille must have every other sunday morning and you seem so disappointed if i refuse to go skating or canoeing with you and the children on the fine days that i foolishly yield and you the daughter of a deacon i continued unsparingly let me state by way of explanation that josephine s late father was for many years one of the pillars of the religious society to which he belonged i know i know it is shameful i we are little better than heathens fred only think of it four times in three months she added glancing at the tell tale sheet and i brought up to go regularly both morning and afternoon in addition to sunday school i am a heathen and as for she exclaimed with a sad reproachful smile so long as josephine was content to berate herself without including me in her anathemas i had been ready to acquiesce in what she said but now that she seemed disposed to drag me into the conversation i felt it incumbent upon me to reply with dignity will you please explain my dear why it is that though i used to be a regular worshipper before we became man and wife i have almost entirely ceased to attend church since that time who is responsible for the change i wonder there is a point beyond which it is not safe to prod josephine and i could see from the expression of her eye that we had reached it
jenks plainly puzzled where s the other in the boat said letty we brought this ashore because the boys wanted to play jungle travelers and carry things slung on a pole over their shoulders captain jenks laughed as he marshaled the children on the boat i suppose uncle silas will be put out over the boat being lost said letty thoughtfully pulling nelson and albert out of the captain s way as he started the engine he had just painted it and the oarlocks were new this year i wish i had made sure that knot was tied no use grieving over what s done and past said captain jenks wisely meg we re going to lose dot overboard again if she is nt removed from that railing sure enough there was dot half way over the railing her small sandals hooked around a cleat in an endeavor to keep her balance just as meg opened her mouth to call her she turned ship ahoy she cried trying to imitate captain jenk s most nautical term starboard or port asked the captain gravely though his eyes twinkled the four navigation in the few weeks they had known the captain but dot was too excited to remember what she had learned it s right here she shouted oh you ll run into it the rowboat the rowboat cried letty dancing up and down oh captain jenks what do you think of that it s uncle silas s boat and the oar is in it and our sweaters and everything fine but do nt lose your heads said captain jenks placidly no one had ever seen him agitated bobby you take the wheel and hold it steady bobby proudly took the wheel and captain jenks while the others watched breathlessly brought the rowboat alongside with a long iron hook and with another drew up the long rope that was tied to an iron ring in the prow then the rowboat was fastened to the stern of the sarah and as captain jenks remarked on apple tree island and the four little blossoms were put ashore after saying good by to letty blake and her cousins she lived in greenpier and captain jenks had known her since she was dot s age let s have lunch ready by the time daddy and mother come back suggested meg we can do it every bit ourselves working like four beavers they soon had lunch and a good lunch too set out on the table they had promised never to light the oil stove so they could not make tea but mother blossom could do that in a very few minutes when she came when the table was ready meg ran out for some red clover and tall grasses for a bouquet and bobby followed her leaving dot and twaddles alone i think we ought to have some jelly on the table do nt you said dot we never have enough jelly mother likes currant you get it and i never lets me have the can opener dot got a chair and climbed up on it she was just able to reach the shelf in the closet where the tumblers of jelly were kept she knew that currant jelly was red and she handed down a ruby red glass to the waiting twaddles do nt cut yourself she admonished him as he punched the can opener into the tin lid twaddles and dot did not know that jelly tumblers are not opened with can openers mother blossom and norah always pried off the tin lids and used them the next year for other glasses oh gee there s a lot of wax on top twaddles reported when he had torn a jagged hole in the lid and found the jelly was protected with a layer of paraffin how ll i get that off take a fork advised dot here i ll show you she seized a fork and jammed it into the paraffin bits twaddles clean blouse and plentifully decorating dot s white apron mother s coming cried meg rushing into the kitchen with her flowers then she stopped dot blossom look what you re done she wailed well there was not much use in scolding after it was done and daddy and mother blossom said that since the twins had been so good about helping to get lunch that they should not be punished beyond having to go without any jelly for that meal of course the four little blossoms had a great deal to tell about the children they had helped captain jenks to rescue from kidd s island daddy and mother blossom had seen the captain in greenpier and already knew of the rescue but did not know many of the details that the children now gave them we saw mr harley said mother blossom bringing out her darning basket after lunch to one of the pretty trees where the family were fond of sitting meg yesterday when we were playing at mr harley s house we found a little hobby horse that must have belonged to one of the boys i s pose there was nt room for it in the trunk i do nt think poor mrs harley packed a trunk sighed mother blossom mr harley says he believes she walked out of the house and took nothing with her except the clothes she wore she had a suitcase of things for the children polly said and that was all well if that s the case it s funny we ca nt find a clue remarked daddy blossom i ve looked and i know dick has looked everywhere for some kind of note or even a letter she might have left there is nt a scrap to build on a few days after this daddy blossom announced that he was going to greenpier on important business i know daddy shouted father blossom was going over on the morning boat to do
for an american at all she said struck with the idea she added casually except for his speech what was this singular lightening of the heart which matey felt as she ran down the stairs she felt like capering it was absurd she felt exactly she thought with no reason at all as though she had had very good news when she had been expectingbad she laughed at almost everything at the fatness of mimi s new baby at the way they avoided the stuffy french ceremoniousness of mimi s overdraped bourgeois salon and all piled into the kitchen sunlit and copper saucepan decorated where the picnic baskets were being filled at the frantic objections of that absurd lovable ziza to any plan of march to the river which would separate her from her husband she noticed that mimi looked at her curiously as to dance savezvousplanter les choux with him and later on she caught the same look of inquiry from mme vinet as picnic baskets in hand the comfortable family party strolled along the country lane that led from mimi s house to the banks of the marne it is such a lovely lovely autumn day thought matey this friendly autumn sun was enough to make a paralytic leap and run and how deep hearted these civilized french people were how warm the family feeling which kept them all together how nice it was to be with them again she began to sing at the top of her voice m le cure n a pas deux souta a nes a light minded marching song henri had brought back from his military service leading the others she kept it going through all of its interminable variations as they finished the song mimi called out to adrian you have brought back our old mete to us how so inquired adrian she how she did upset all our rules the year she stayed with us never cried matey astonished i was crushed submissive as a little mouse i obeyed more rules than i had thought i could they interrupted her with derisive laughter even henri we always called that year our trip to america he told her adrian shook his head over a disillusionment all those stories of matey s about how suppressed she was they drifted apart in a narrow place in the lane henri and adrian walking together well she has been suppressed since then said henri i have not seen her like this not since she was grown up he added pleasantly the obvious it speaks well for her husband for an instant adrian did not hear him he had been as mystified by matey s high spirits as the vinets as matey herself he ever had with him this was the light heartedness into which he had so longed to open the door for her he had seen one glimpse of it the night of francis visit the evening when they had decided not to put their wedding off till june he had tried tried with all his love his tenderness his passion to free her for it again but he had been in the dark he had not known where to throw his effort what was it that kept her hesitating sent her in the midst of cheerfulness into those inexplicable numb fits made her unable to step off freely into gayety as she was doing today henri s remark finally penetrated to his attention i m afraid it ca nt be laid to her husband he answered trying to speak lightly it s rather improbable that the best of husbands should affect her all at once today like this he returned with the equally obvious it s probably but to himself he thought eagerly wistfully could it be she s just waking up to our being together for always and liking it i ll ask her why not how is it mete mme vinet was saying as she walked beside matey that thy husband knows our marching songs and the commands of our army he spent a year and a half in paris studying painting explained matey i thought you said he is in a bank so he is she hesitated decided that the plainest possible statement was the best and explained he thought he had not enough talent to give himself to painting mme vinet needed no embellishments on this statement ah she murmured not an ordinary young man she looked ahead to where adrian was carrying mimi s delighted four year old the sound of his laughter and the delicious said seriously to matey as she would to a daughter mete i think thou hast a good husband thou must be a good wife to him matey was a little surprised by this it was very different from any of the comments spoken or unspoken she had received on her marriage from her american circle no one had ever put it to her from that side thou must learn how to make up to him for what he has put away said mme vinet earnestly as though matey were still a little girl under her care but it was ziza little mad inflammatory ziza who challenged matey most directly after the lunch stuffed and somnolent theyplay about the river bank smoking and making their digestions the two adrians with leisurely gestures were bailing out a waterlogged boat preparatory to taking their brides for a row on the river matey and ziza sat together their backs against a great sycamore looking down on mete cherie ziza asked pouncingly are you making your husband happy well i hope so said matey heartily she thought ziza replied no you re not not what i call happy or you could nt answer in that voice you are not happy as i i am crazy crazy crazy about my husband each impassioned folle follel burst up from her like a ball from a roman candle you re not

orleans on the steamer john g meiggs to hire workers to build the railroad he offered a dollar a day and grub and hired seven hundred men some of them had been down before in the filibustering days of

weddings local conventions of elks obscure deaths murders and suicides among lithuanians albanians croats poles the difficulties over naturalization papers of greek restaurant keepers dinners of the sons of italy he lived in a big red frame house a mrs cook a crotchety old woman from belfast who had been forced to take lodgers since her husband who had been a foreman in one of the homestead mills had been crushed by a crane dropping a load of pigiron over him she made ward his breakfasts and his sunday dinners and stood over him while he was eating them alone in the stuffy furniture crowded diningroom telling him about her youth in the north of ireland and the treachery of papists and the virtues of the defunct mr cook it was a bad time for ward he had no friends in pittsburgh and he had colds and sore throats all through the cold grimy sleety winter he hated the newspaper office and the inclines and the overcast skies and the breakneck wooden stairs he was always scrambling up and down and the smell of poverty and cabbage and children and washing in the rattletrap tenements where he was always seeking out mrs piretti whose husband had been killed in a rumpus in a saloon on

and two and two there is no difference between younger and older between told and told her between him and between him there is no difference hurriedly when this is said said said said very well up there so yes very well up there this is the way of it as they as they this is the way of said and say they are rich and richer every day in the ordinary meaning of the word to be seen tell well that it is to be seen that every one being well to do well to do how do you do everybody who is through through with it lamentably everybody who is through through with it lamentably to suppose wind is from the direction from which it comes this makes the formation of the clouds very much as much as if they were there in inches beside this if the desire to go on in a day makes it as if to say never to say so in their behalf there is no inexactitude in riches and richer how can it be that a drama which they see has to be has to be indifferently that if as ever they are more than that behind there is no difference at all whether it is he or having him or his or held or brillat savarin or their laudation or by the time or with a window and respect or in respect to losses losses of wild pansies which can be used as an infusion none of these do as date and dates and prepared plenty advantageously an original placing it up and down theirs and hindrance and how many times have they been betrothed no difference between as rich and talking let it be every one as rich as rich as rich as letting it be every one as rich as rich as rich and letting it be letting it be every one as rich there may be worry but there can not be poverty there can be worry but there can not be poverty there can be worry there can be worry there can be worry but there can not be poverty everybody sits alone and not everybody sits alone and not and everybody sits alone and not everybody sits alone nobody sits alone who is not here and here and everybody who sits alone is everybody who is here and here everybody anybody there is no redress for baby could not help it now now or endow endow yenne why because everybody finds their cake delicious coming back who lived here was it by the time that it was an advantage that they planted poplars in time for this in particular and practically by he best way of passing within an appreciable distance it nobody can know why he was very willing to be serviceable in case and out out and out and going with a and without a father and son it is currently expected that very many follow with another in this and sweetly having been very likely that the bell rang they marry if she made it easy to read the marriage contract a contract to marry if she made it easy for the imitation and the other one who could call following false cock false cock and no answer and by the best of embroidery which is white with a delicate touch and so they marry marry marry three when this you see you can marry me when this you see you can marry me marry marry undeniably marry and see see that orchids are brown and withal withal withal intent it is undeniably an undeniably undertaken intentionally when this marriage with coming to be to be hit egrally undeniably having settled that every one is rich and richer how many have they in it to begin to mean lamarline and bonnat bonnat has been called bennett and as such was torn away from the salad and the result of a courageous boy with a cart a boy being a young man and stirred by and by he was ahead and not behead beheaded please be in difference indifference by their pleasure there are there separate stories and stones and five he was a student in a college where he learned to love and long and afterwards as there were no clouds and even riches and very much just observation of the causes of their celebration so much so that curtains are supper and surprises there would be conversation and hear them speak speak urgently a great many and right and rights and rights and right right right a religious rite that is especially in conversation that is one effective underlying withal and arise arising by daylight conversation can be seen when all and tried tiring makes finally forget me nots easily and so to seen two seen and or and oriole and an edible bird mistakenly if everybody is rich when are mountains covered with snow we know some say that everything away means eating at noon this does change daughters to mothers bonnat was killed not by the regular attackers but by the aid of a boy who was a young man and pushed a cart as a cover conversation about character pit is very rare to see three brothers working together and if there is an exodus there will not be more than old and young and young and old and in between when medallions of letting it alone are strung in this way they are different in their turn to apples grapes cakes and further destruction of three trees which are valuable only in so far as there are stretches of wood and listening make birds be birds and poppies be poppies and astronomers be astronomers this is the third supposition when this you see more having and more having were having a very little longer and shorter conversation whether standing or sitting everybody is rich quietly everybody is as
long speech very romantic such as my mother had read to me out of a book by a mr congreve an englishman and recite it to her it turned out that there was no immediate need of preparing myself for this pleasant task the length of the carry from the third pond to the little brook that fell into dead river was three miles three miles we thought with the memories of our other carries behind us was nothing but three miles and so we double loaded our canoe piling our stores at the ends so that we would not break it in the middle and set off among the bateaumen of greene s division for withers of a mountain very steep so that the skin on our shoulders was rubbed backward very cruelly then for another mile we traveled easily down the opposite slope of the mountain disregardful of the manner in which the skin on our shoulders was being rubbed forward and hailing each other jocosely at the ease with which we progressed even though our legs ached as though they would bend and snap under us and the skin of our faces burned from our exertions until we might near have fried a flounder on them and finally ahead of us we saw a long green meadow level and beautiful dotted here and there with thickets and edged with a heavy growth of spruces and cedars though neither hobomok nor i could remember this meadow from our trip of many years before nor indeed could we remember any of the great carrying place since it was a firm trail sheltered by heavy trees when we knew it where now it was a broad churned road the feet of monstrous heavy wayfarers so with light hearts we stepped out onto this fair meadow and then we saw what we had not realized until we set foot on it that it was a bed of rich green moss growing over a foul heavy mud of prodigious sliminess so that our legs sank into the mud well nigh to the knee at each step if there had been only the mud to suck at our trembling muscles i make no doubt that we would have come to bog brook with no harm done save a little time expended but under the mud there were the jagged stumps of ancient trees and the barbs of decayed branches the graveyard of a forest that had died from floods and fallen before mountain storms as all ancient forests have fallen in these northern woods the stumps and barbs tore at our water soaked shoes and moccasins and at the skin beneath nor was there any manner in which we could avoid them or protect ourselves from them slip down at each step nearly to a sitting position until our feet had reached a foundation and then we would lift the canoe forward eight inches or even a foot and then drag our feet from the mud and take another step there was one fool near the center of the meadow i remember one of a crew of bateaumen who would scream horribly at intervals shrieking there s something near my feet or i just stepped on something or i know i walked on a fish in the course of time after this fool had screamed there would be a shout of what is it from the entire line of soldiers whereupon the fool would shriek fish and we would move forward another eight inches in the course of time we came to narrow bog brook its waters brown and smelling of deadness but each of us as he reached it lowered himself into it soused himself up and down until the sweat and the slime and the stench of the mud had gone from him thereupon desirous of seeing no more of the great carrying place ever those whose luggage was entirely carried set off down bog brook one by one and we could hear them across the meadow that separates the brook from dead river bawling at each other as they went poling up against the river s sluggish current as for those others who had brought only a part of their belongings they would set off across the dreadful meadow again sinking through the fair level green moss into the foul mud pitching forward or sideways as their feet struck the snags and barbs of the stumps beneath and dragging out their blackened feet and legs and struggling slowly onward when we had washed ourselves we stored our baggage on a little knoll of high land on the far side of the brook and without more ado set off down bog brook ourselves i knew when we turned there was little use in following the bateaux upstream for it seemed to me that natanis would do one of two things either send a messenger to me at night when he had located me or watch for me himself at the point where i must enter dead river therefore we turned downstream away from the bateaux and drifted with the current there were three crows on a tall pine a little downstream from us and as we drifted the three of them sprang into the it with an excited cawing and flew directly toward a twisted bull pine that stood in a thicket on the far side of the river around this tree they circled and as they did so other crows came from downstream and swerved and swooped over the tree raising an outcry that came faintly to us hobomok grinned and drove the canoe downstream natanis is talking to the crows he said we went ashore abreast of the old bull pine and in the thicket beneath it we as were we to see them it had been many years since i had seen natanis yet he had changed almost not at all from the boy we had rescued from
and the return of his first born son fernando as well as the safe return of the rescued prisoners announced a three days holiday and sent out invitations to his friends to come and join with them on this gala occasion they came from near and far in goodly numbers it mattered not how many just so they came care free and ready to take part in the games dances wrestling matches and the singing there was an abundance of food but none of the guests came empty handed and all expected to have a good time the dances of the early california indians differed greatly from those of other indians in various parts of the united states when seen at night in the enchanting light of the moon or a blazing campfire the effect was startling and bizarre these dances were only indulged in the circle sometimes chanting to the stamping steps and grunts of the males father jacob baegert who had been in charge of one of the lower california missions left the following description of their ancient dances their dances consist in a foolish irregular gesticulating and jumping or advancing and walking in a circle yet they take such delight in these amusements that they spend whole nights in their performance these pastimes though innocent in themselves had to be rigidly interdicted because the grossest disorders and vices were openly perpetrated by the natives during the performances but it is hardly possible to prevent them from indulging in their sports the younger element cared less for dancing but it seemed to be fond of wrestling and a simple and almost childlike gambling game that consisted in guessing in which hand a stick of wood or shell was held on the last night of the fiesta martin reyes who loved all kinds of manly sports easily defeated cuyamac the strongest and most an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of natooka cuyamac greatly chagrined at his defeat and jealous of the favor shown reyes by natooka and many others as well was overheard making threats against the life of reyes there was still another element that cared not at all for the tribal games or dances but preferred a far more interesting pastime a game known the world over and it was cojuati sister of topanque who was trying to instruct manuel machado in the rudiments of the ancient game hoping thereby to overcome his bashfulness it was to prove a difficult task but her ardent nature and her sincere belief that success would crown her efforts made the work an enjoyable pastime love making is an art and cojuati was a past mistress of all its intricacies and unknown to machado she was gradually weaving about him a net that finally enmeshed the gallant soldier and held him captive to her charms martin reyes had been in such great demand since his arrival not seen much of natooka but now that he had completed the lengthy program that had been prepared for him which had included playing the guitar singing duets with fernando some spanish love songs dancing the fandango bolero and other old fashioned spanish dances and as a finale the wrestling match with cuyamac he joined natooka the senorita of his dreams together they walked off into the night father amurrio the guest of honor at topanque s rancheria was looked upon as a superman by the savages although he had so far acquired only a smattering of the dialect used by topanque s tribe he made good use of it in telling them about some of the fiestas he had enjoyed as a boy in spain then gradually he began to interest them in more serious stories and at the end of the third day s entertainment and long past the customary bedtime hour he asked fernando to act as his interpreter while he told them of a wonderful fiesta recounted in the bible how one of christ s disciples had betrayed him with a kiss and how his name had been handed down from generation to generation as the man who sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver the story made a deep impression upon the indians at the close as a tribute to topanque and his people father amurrio asked fernando to recite the lord s prayer in his native tongue serra in mexico father serra accompanied by a fifteen year old indian boy named juan evangelista one of the first of the monterey converts had safely reached san blas a port on the western coast of mexico the day following his arrival there he left for tepic a small inland town some distance from san blas where the franciscans maintained a convent known as the hospice de santa cruz where serra intended to rest a few days before leaving on his long overland journey to the capital besides the two burros which father serra and juan evangelista were riding they had two which they were slowly traveling frequently dipped into beautiful valleys and rose up over rugged and picturesque mountains that awed the young indian lad who had never beheld such a wondrous sight before several days after leaving tepic father serra complained of having a severe headache and as it grew worse he decided after having reached a suitable camp site to rest awhile evangelista helped him to dismount and quickly arranged blankets and pillows to make the father comfortable it was quite a new experience for the young indian to have a sick man to care for as he looked at father serra he noticed that he was breathing very heavily and his half opened eyes seemed wholly unconscious of his surroundings this began to worry evangelista and he did nt know what to do looking about him he saw a small adobe cabin some distance away and after waiting a while longer hoping that father serra might wake up he decided to walk over to the cabin and
there remained golf which bart suspected he pursued principally as an agreeable form of killing time and his daughter it had been only within the last year or so that bart had resumed relations with gill the latter had made the advances admitting frankly he was proud of bart s fame was pleased to claim kinship they had not much in common having developed along different lines and now they had reached middle age with points of view regarding life and society widely at variance bart had been drawn to gill by sympathy for him his brother was lonely and except for his devotion to sylvia talked and acted like a man who the way he turned to bart with the latter s fuller life and more engaging contacts for companionship and confidences bart was not at all sure what he thought of his brother since boyhood gill had lived solely for himself cultivating profitable friendships improving his circumstances ignoring obligations gill was an opportunist dulling his ears shutting his eyes to anything and everything not immediately of service to him having won all he desired he had come to his fifties to find nothing left for which to strive and then unexpectedly and undeservedly within the past two years sylvia had suddenly blossomed forth radiant and beautiful filling her father s life to overflowing and this belated affection the only really unselfish love he had ever known had softened and humanized him pathetic figure though he was to day bart was conscious of a definite reservation in regard to his respect for him he could not banish the memory of the time when gill had left his mother brothers and the early years of his own and peggy s struggle in new york when a friendly hand or an encouraging word would have done much to hearten and make things easy for them yet withal bart was drawn to him the older man reached out for companionship the younger said to himself as he mounted the steps of the studio apartment building in which he lived perhaps he did gill an injustice perhaps the man had really changed at heart and had come to realize too late all that he had missed in life he felt gill s need of him he opened the door with his latchkey burns in the hallway helped him remove his overcoat took his hat and stick mrs carter home burns no sir mrs carter s still out bart passed into the lofty studio he loved this room he and mildred had planned every detail of its furnishing at one end was a tall wide window of prismed glass and gauze curtains which might be adjusted with a long bamboo pole at night the whole could be obliterated by thick folds of turquoise blue velvet a balcony ran along one side with a rather precipitous staircase leading from it to the studio floor and on the side opposite the great window stood a hooded stone fireplace of noble proportions which projected ten feet into the room a large oil by matisse smaller canvases of cezanne picasso and other moderns and an italian altar cloth of matchless gold needlework surrounded by a lark plush crimson border covered the bare paneling of the fourth wall there were a black ebony piano rugs leather and upholstered chairs of italian design and workmanship a carved chest massive gilded cathedral candlesticks a broad flat topped desk near the window an escritoire a century in age and bookshelves shelves high and low laden with books crammed with books overflowing with books bart enjoyed its comfortable confusion my dear it s my room him with its disorder i like it this way it looks lived in used and besides it has the kind of atmosphere in which i can write i never liked the spick and spanness of the taormina villa the north window was a pale luminous square to night filling the studio with ghostly light and ghostly shadows burns drew together the velvet hangings and bart jerked the chains dangling to three bulbs of a jeweled lamp which stood on the cluttered desk instantly the room was transformed into one of dim beauty and romance the shadows deepening softening warm tones touching kindly the surfaces of the heavy furniture caressing their outlines spreading like a gracious tide over the heavily rugged floor in a small neat pile upon one of the extended slides of his desk lay the afternoon mail bart sank into his swivel chair picked up his black rimmed spectacles fitted them to his ears invitations a note from his publishers one from a newspaper syndicate other business communications i ie cast the rest aside and slit the claps of these last with a steel opener i le had sent all his children wrist watches for christmas the first was from his

in gemini you re right but is nt astrology rather piffle yes but so would mathematics be if they taught you twice five are eleven calling things piffle wo nt take the jupiter influence out of your life joe did not care to argue about astrology who taught you such good english he asked i never learned any bad english until i talked to an englishman there was almost a war between hawkesey and me to see which could corrupt the other i t was funny i liked the swear words and that shocked him because hawkesey is a puritan underneath the surface he began to try to talk like an officer with a hot potato in his mouth and half his syllables missing so i swore each time he mispronounced a word and i had to swear so often that he went away all alone and practised how to speak in order to save my soul from hell do you consider yourself an indian funny hawkesey asked that question the first black lightday he met me is a bird in an oven a cake because i am caged in india am i indian my friends are indian if you mean by that that they were born here but so was i i have the kindest friends that were ever patient with a strange bird in their high nest it was so high in the treetops that i used to be afraid of falling out particularly when the wind blew but they taught me to fly and i have flown and i have brought back food for them do you know who your father and mother were yes amal told me it was sweet of them to bring me to be born in india they must have been lovely people so i suppose the lords of life let them go as soon as i was born they may have had trouble enough and destiny take its course they might have tried to struggle against destiny and i think they were nt the kind of people who deserve such torture so they were let die very swiftly and i dare say the darlings thought dying was dreadful until they found themselves out of their bodies do you believe in an after life she chuckled who wants to believe in anything i insist on knowing do nt you do nt let s talk philosophy you could nt you do nt know any yet that shocks you does nt it you have read bergson i suppose and kant and spencer and william james a little aristotle babies all of them how do you know i too have read them how else should i know they are babies arguing in three dime aons although if they would stop for a minute to tl of dimensions they are pretty conscious of at least five however philosophers do nt think it is not respectable some day one of the gods will throw an apple at tl erg as was done at newton then they will wake up one by one black light where are you going joe asked home may i see trou home no it would offend my escort they are gentlemen who have foregone sleep after a long day s soldiering merely because it pleases them to protect my dignity as they express it i must snub you rather than offend them life is a matter of choosing between predicaments may i see you again how can you avoid that if that is destined you believe in destiny it makes no difference to destiny whether we believe or not but you do nt believe then why not try going away there are airplanes take one then you will soon know whether destiny has other intentions you advise that why not it wo nt hurt you good night he thought her parting smile was wistful although he was not sure she and sadness seemed to have no bond in common and yet perhaps it was his own lack of pleasure in life that made him see her through a sad lense or perhaps it was moonlight he could feel his heart thumping and it made him angry he was a roaster of men and millions not a silly emotional ass to be stirred out of his proper orbit by a girl s smile ile wondered what color her eyes were how little and light she looked how tall and graceful when the ayah followed and touched her sari that she wore like a roman toga how small when the seven man escort formed up wo by two and tramped behind her one man grunting gruff commands and giving probably a thousand pounds or so of bearded bone and muscle fit to fight its weight in anything that breathed tamed by a girl who walked like something flowing in the moonlight guess i m going crazy black light joe turned about and found hawkes facing him the jail door was shut and the sentry was pacing his beat with shouldered carbine chandri lai sweating and breathing heavily drew near and squatted with his basket in front of joe how do you like her hawkes asked she s surprising what does that fool want now nothing i mean anything shall i kick him no tell him to go to the devil joe strode to where the horses waited with their reins tied to a grinning god s leg by the fountain in the shadow beneath the waler s belly the ayah crouched shrugging herself damn you he told her you stink and you harmony go home do you hear me beat it but the ayah watched dumbly until he swung himself into the saddle and when he rode away she followed like a good dog padding uncomplaining in the dust chapter eight do i get my money joe s first reaction took the form of anger against hawkes and annie seems to have allowed a white girl
which might be so greatly to own advantage kip sent to maggie may a letter which had been written an revised and torn up and written again several times in its fin version it did not go into particulars about the night life of ma hattan and the tendency of successful dramatists to fall in lo with their leading ladies no it could not bring itself to hint things so teche country it was a missive reserved but solemn in ton and perhaps more alarming for what it failed to say it inform miss maggie may that new york was a city of many temptation and that men of genius were emotional and roger in particular was too generous now he needed help and there was no one wh could give it quite so well as his sister at least that was how it seemed to kip and he hoped that mis maggie may would excuse him for his boldness also he hoped tha she would never tell roger what he had done because roger resented interference with his affairs and if the visit were to do an good miss maggie may would have to think up some reasons o her own for coming the letter added very humbly that of course kip would he glad to see her again and to do anything he could to make things easy for her no that last was one and finally cut out entirely because of the possibility that it might sound like the shadow of a nit that the tarleton house had vacant rooms maggie may answered promptly she understood the meaning hip s warnings and thanked him for his kindness it was very but perhaps the trouble was hereditary and they should not me poor roger too severely she would come and do the best u could her cousin mrs fessenden had invited her several times to pay a visit and that would be the easiest way to arrange at tors maggie may was writing to mrs fessenden at once and would let kip know of the arrangements certainly she would cr mention to anyone but her mother kip s part in the matter thanked him again and looked forward with pleasure to see him she wrote again in a week or so she was coming to new york a few days kip was in a fine glow of excitement with many problems to occupy meet maggie may or would her relatives those rich and important perms think he was butting in and what would roger do about lilian ashton roger had never told his people that he had quit the tarleton house his mail from home still came there how could he explain to his sister the address in the apartment hotel ml what excuse would he give for never inviting her there kip put the problem up to jerry who laughed and said that sooner later maggie may was going to have to wake up to the realities the world about her and probably it would be sooner sisters were nt such dubs nowadays but kip insisted that maggie mayas different from any and all other girls jerry said how old as she must be twenty now kip said twenty one and jerry wed you keep track of her birthdays do you what you ter do kid is get busy this trip and not let her wither did not fail to think of this problem lilian ashton it was presently made known that he was more d of her than ever and had decided to go out and stay with fessendens for a while he would occupy that cottage which cousin had offered him and spend his time thinking out a new y it was springtime and the country would be pleasant and would take long walks and renew old times with his sister kip a thrill over this how delightful to a born reformer to play role of guardian angel and guide men s destinies without their ing the least idea of it the afternoon came and kip was invited by roger to join the welcome he put on his best suit of clothes which tayl tibbs had brought back from the cleaner s and from which mother and aunt picked the last scrap of lint he had a ne fedora hat and a pair of gloves to match his mother having accompanied him and v much fussed up and elated he met roger at the pennsylvania station and roger by some magic known to celebrities obtain permission to go clown to the tracks where the train came in th was maggie may descending from a car in a blue silk dress a little straw hat for springtime with a bunch of blue bells on it kip saw everything in a flash and would love blue bells and bl dresses forever and forever after she was a grown young lady now very sedate yet happy so glad to see them she came hurrying and gave roger a hug she went on hugging him until the tears came into her ey she shook both of kip s hands and stood looking the two men first one and then the other oh roger you are pale and thi you have been overworking it was the tact of a girl who w used to managing men to say you have overworking was dignified to kip s said you do nt look a day older and that was not so goo because kip was tired of being the kid and having jerry t him he would never grow up till he cut loose from his mother s apron strings he was almost twenty four now but stood the as much rattled as a schoolboy maggie may told them scraps of news from home and what s of a trip she had had and how glad she was again and the maggie s lad sent them and how he had planted another
she said smiling at them through her clear unhidden tears i am so glad her small teeth shone in her pale quivering mouth i am so glad it is so she said charlotte nicolas was trying to say to the bleat of the children s voices as they played was following up the wind and the big brilliant sea gathered softly under charlotte s chin i shall speak of it soon to jean she said firmly blowing her small nose i may have a little trouble making him understand she said but it s going to be all right everything that i suggest to him at first it takes him a day or two to understand monique crouched back on her heels watching them all and suddenly charlotte began to speak again to them there is something else too i want to tell you she said watching bridget shyly there is something else she said she sat looking shyly at bridget did you know she said to her did maman tell you yet bridget looked into charlotte s eyes and shook her head charlotte s lids lifted for of her bosom approached the sun stained crescent which lay about her throat bridget suddenly and distinctly knew i m going to give you another little nephew or niece she said she had turned a rosy red and she was laughing oh what a wretched business said nicolas in real distress lolotte you re only thirty two and five of them already is nt it time you decided whether your responsibility is to the living or to the unconceived it was all a sort of joke to charlotte she sat in the sand shaking her head and laughing one more wo nt matter she said it s my life is nt it upon the homeward ride nicolas shyly took bridget sphand and drew it through his arm how will you like it how will you like being in north africa he said his voice was soft and whispering close in her ear and neck hidden from charlotte and in great humility to her shy and apologetic scarcely daring to look into her face it will be too wonderful she said he held her fingers tightly in his palm he sat close to her holding her hand as though there was so much he wished to say to her but not a word of it could he force from his lips i have been terribly worried bridget he said suddenly he lifted her hand against his cheek i have been crazy with worry about what we should ever do he said into her palm oh sweet children said charlotte to them teasing them and laughing as they sat holding hands in the deep cushions of the car now i see you happy she said but now that things are arranged i ca nt ever let you go i shall die without my bridget and my nicol she said bridget had not yet really nicolas words and charlotte s talking of this to her it became an actual thing to go to go away to go away to another country to go so far away to go so far away from what she asked herself all the way home in the car up the white road and down the valleys soaring screaming out at turns all the way home she sorted the litter the bits of ribbon the remnants of disorder in her mind this feeling of relinquishment in her was foul as a rat trap and stiff and relentless there like a dried bouquet this is what becomes of idleness she thought in anger she wanted the whole summer back again to make it all anew why am i having these bunches of old lavender these dried knots of garlic infecting the thoughts that i have why this chop suey mess of uncertainty in me down the drive they swept with a splatter of gravel upon the bridge table and far away from what thought bridget as she looked through the window at the faces of maman and papa and jean and the three girls to go so far away from what she thought as she stepped out of the car but before she had time to take a step towards them the girls had rushed up to her waving their elation in their exultant hands luc luc luc they cried as they surrounded her each one of them had a letter from luc and before bridget could have her tea even she must sit down with them and listen to every word that luc had to say luc they said to her as if it were a caress luc as if the mere dwelling upon it could prolong it into syllables of sound luc thought bridget as she sat listening to them reading out his polite small words luc luc luc to marthe his letter was a sign to walk slowly out into the road that had been built by peasants to go from field to market and from farm to farm and which did not linger by the side of the rance castle island was a melting vision between the tree stems for charlotte had been allowed to plant them this way to conceal the dock s stone walls luc in rennes now strong and bitter as stone to be washed against by little ripples of love to be caressed by cloud kisses marthe s face flushed with shame at the thought of this but now it was begun and ringing in her she would be soft as the flowering crest of the river s salted wave soft as the evening and the dry floury sand for all that was doctor shell competence in him must be breaking in him like a heart for gentleness to marthe it was a sign to come to bridget s room and look in the glass for a long time at her face at the
new fifteen story sky scrapers by a broker who was to take her to luchow s did not even occur to her what did occur to her must have flashed into her telephone home not to wait dinner when i am detained will you come it s been so long since we have had a talk i feel the need of it ray standing there it came over her with finality what she knew to be her inability to deny him the coming together of ray schmidt and walter saxel was something so gradual so innocent of scheme or plan that its course was unmarked by the concrete incident of reaching their conclusion it was impossible looking back for ray to determine exactly when she reached her decision to leave blarney s where she had spent six years of her life in new york more than that it was even difficult to go back over those conversations with walter that had dwelt upon the feasibility of a flat certainly there was in ray the day some two months following the encounter as she rode in a cab holding on to hat boxes and minor baggage consciousness that in traversing the short distance from west fifty third street she was crossing the vast steppes which separate respectability from denande but not in the sense of any overpowering realization that she was burning bridges after her there had never been an instant in the years intervening between that first meeting in front of the c h and d and this sharp transition in her life brought about by the step she was now taking that subconsciously she had not been prepared to do not necessarily this but whatever was wanted or desired by the one human being in the world whose wish was her law even back in the cincinnati days walter she now realized could have had this for the asking this or less or more everything or as he had chosen to decide nothing as he would then as now in fact she caught herself thinking one day in the solitude to which she was to become so inured it is sweeter this way in almost any her isolation into a corner of his life was to become more complete as affairs between them became more and more clandestine this way it was all or nothing yes it was sweeter here was a situation that unfolded itself not by machination but as naturally as a flower unfolds itself the talk about the flat had been scrappy and chiefly when he began to find it difficult to determine upon places for them to meet or dine in order that their presence would not seem repetitious or conspicuous as a means to an end indecision doubts of her which had so characterized their early days seemed to have vanished because he said to her so simply that her heart did not even quicken by a beat ray this ca nt go on the time has come for us to have a place of our own where i can come without all this scheming yes walter we need a flat some place where kind of thing can not go on without becoming conspicuous even in a city like this i ve thought of that you have so much to consider i want you to feel about all this ray as a frenchwoman would feel about it the time has come for us to call a spade a spade my feeling for you and my feeling for my wife and children are things separate and apart i can be loyal to both these feelings because they are so different should she despise him for that the thought rushed to her that now was the last instant of her last opportunity to keep her life her intact own to refuse to become part of an active disloyalty to the wife of a man who coveted and was coveted in return to refuse to become the mistress of a man who took pains to establish this wife s footing on the very eve of her surrender to his convenience there was yet time but so fleeting shall you find the place the flat walter yes it was better that way the talk of money would havepbeen abominable to her what he could afford or what he could not afford was sure to be equally right what he chose was a three room apartment on the third floor of a large five story red brick building on broadway not remote from the beginnings of central park it was a rear flat and the bathroom and bedroom looking into a narrow air shaft required gaslight burning in them all day but the large living room and full sized kitchen facing the backs of buildings of a parallel street seventh avenue were filled with morning sunshine and remained bright into late afternoon offhand it was the sort of apartment house that externally at least seemed far too pretentious for the modest rear flats that were tucked into it but apparently those facingbroadway justified the heavily embossed pressed leather foyer walls solemn walnut stairways with a plaster nubian slave on the they were of ten and twelve rooms built railroad fashionalong a narrow hallway that shot the entire length of the flat and rented for as high as sixty dollars a month into her small rear one furnished in what walter had apparently chosen en suite ray fitted with the close adjustment of a hit of fungus to its wall snugly and immediately it became home to her the first premises that had ever allowed her the full privacy of a kitchen in which to putter unrestrictedly there was a parlor set consisting of five pieces mahogany with freckled cinnamon plush upholstery edged in ball fringe a substantial five piece mission bedroomset of walnut with a fine clear mirror in the wardrobedoor taboret dresser and wash stand and walter s
told himself that it was swell and he was in luck he told lucy that he guessed they could walk together at that he became suddenly leery and uncertain because a guy could never be sure when he was and when he was nt saying the right thing to a girl he felt that he should have said something different to her he hoped that he had nt said anything that would make her sore and change her mind so she would nt go to the park with him he waited and worried while she went into the house and it took a long time so that he got nervous and was afraid she was nt coming but he waited anyway he heard some young kids in the shires of her girl friends and a ten year old punk named norman something or other they were talking about having a show party in one of the basements across the street they enthusiastically agreed to and they ran across the street looking quite cute and innocent studs watched them skip and said to himself with a quizzical look on his face jesus christ he scowled scratched his head and asked himself if hepshould tell helen shires he decided not to because he hated any kind of a snitcher he laughed to himself thinking how funny it was and what a knockout of a story it would be for dan and the guys if they would promise not to pass it on i le thought of his kid sister fritzie telling himself that she would nt never do a thing like that if he ever found her doing it he d certainly boot her tail around the block until she could nt walk straight but then he guessed there was something in catholic there was helen shires she was fine just like a pal or a guy s best friend but then there was somethingdifferent and purer in a girl like lucy which stopped her from talking about the things he and helen talked about yes sir he was pretty certain about that something purer in catholic girls he laughed because the little kids had been so funny he thought about going over and peeking in on their party but just then he saw lucy she came out wearing a reddish orange wash dress which looked nice on her because she was dark curly haired with red fair skin and the dress set her off just right and she had on a little powder and lipstick but it did nt make her look like a sinful woman or anything of that sort studs did nt usually pay attention to how girls looked except to notice the shape of their legs because if they had good legs they were supposed to be good for you know to notice their boobs if they were big enough to bounce he looked at lucy she was cute all right he told himself that she was cute he told himself that he liked her he repeated to himself that he liked her and she was cute his heart beat faster and he scarcely knew what he was doing they strolled east on fifty seventh street a negro nursemaidcame along with a bow legged baby and lucy made a fuss over it studs thought it was a pain but he decided that girls were girls and if they were like lucy they must be higher creatures that a guy just could nt understand no matter how much he tried he pretended that he was in terested in the darling tot but it gave him a pain they strolled on and studs kept side glancing at angelic lucy straining his mind to think of something to say he said that it was a nice day all right she agreed that made a fellow want to do nothing and she said yes she said she liked doing nothing studs said that usually he did nt like doing nothing but now he felt different from the way he felt on most days he said that there was too much for a guy to do to want to do just nothing he told her some of the things a kid could do instead of doing nothing he told her how he red o connell and the gang had gotten red s beebe gun and had stood on red s porch shooting pigeons and he had killed the most three and how red had shot muggsy mccarthy in the pa the back and muggsy did nt know who shot him and it was funny and then red had gotten his old man s chalmers and they had gone riding and red had stepped on it and they had gone down south park avenue fifty miles an hour and and they had broken five or six of them she said it was just horrid and that boys just wanted to make mischief as sister bernadette marie always said boys had the germ of destruction in them and they did perfectly awful horrid things but she said it just like a girl meaning the exact opposite they came to the park where it was cooler she walked more slowly and they gazed idly about them everything was sun colored and people walked around as if they had nothing to do it was nice out all right with the sky all so blue and the clouds all puffed and white and floating as if they were icebergs in a sea that did nt have any waves and he thought it would be fine if he and lucy could have wings and fly away past the sky he thought about their flying away flying right through clouds and way past the other side of the sky where there was nothing kind of a place with a palace and servants and everything they wanted to make them happy and all studs had to do to get the place
the children whittled out of the bottom of rivulets on a large pumpkin beside the teacher s chair was scratched a map of the world with the stein for the north pole everything lucy lacefield did she did rapidly he needed she kept bricks to his hand and recleaned them before she laid them down in the midst of this work she had leisure womanlike she talked to toussaint about himself his life in florence what he was going to do here on the plantation i tell luke he ought to fertilize his cotton said the girl this land s worn out you mean manure it queried toussaint you could nt get enough no i mean commercial fertilizers toussaint did not know what she was talking about where do you get that sort of fertilizer i do nt know exactly but there is such a thing i ve read about it in the farm papers i wonder if it would make the land grow much more it says it doubles and trebles the yield said lucy the girl s tone immediately made toussaint want to get some of this miraculous stuff i could get away within a year hazarded toussaint get away echoed lucy where are you and your mother going north i suppose returned the boy but i had thought of going west too white people go west said lucy looking at the youth but colored folks hardly ever do ye es i know that admitted toussaint thinking of his real purpose in fleeing the south at his vague answer the girl looked at him curiously if you made a success here it looks as if you d stay well said toussaint drawing a long breath colored people do nt get their rights here my trouble with cady for instance if he takes me with a warrant i wo nt get a fair show if you make a good tenant and grow lots of cotton you d have a better crisply i suppose that s so admitted toussaint and if you really made a success you d help all the colored folks around here persisted the tan colored girl rapidly it would show people that negroes could be industrious and prosperous it s a responsibility to be a colored person now a white man like cady can do anything and nobody will think any worse of white people for it but if a negro does anything everybody says oh well all negroes are like that i wish i had nt thrown that paintbrush at alex cady cried toussaint i ought to have just let him talk the girl came over and touched his hand they tell me what is without help should be without regard she quoted philosophically while the maxim was sober enough her faint touch on his hand was pleasant to toussaint just then a nasal feminine voice called lucy lucy air you the tan colored girl to step away from toussaint and move to the door where

other way while i o my duty i wish i d hit the old one now this is like murdering a baby upon the opposite side of the forest eshbaal was nee again experiencing surprise for suddenly the the strange noise frightened them soliloquized eshbaal perhaps it is a miracle the goats forpwhich i have searched all day have been made to return unto me as they dashed past the trained eye of the shepherd took note of them there were not many goats in the bunch that had strayed so he had no difficulty in counting them a kid was missing being a shepherd there was nothing for eshbaal to do but set forth in search of the missing one he advanced cautiously alert because of the noise that he had heard eshbaal was a short stocky man with blue eyes and a wealth of blond hair and beard his features were regular and handsome in a primitive savage way his single garment fashioned from a goat skin left his right arm entirely free nor did it impede his legs since it fell not to his knees he carried a club and a rude knife lady barbara took charge of the that beyond hard boiling eggs his knowledge of cookingwas too sketchy to warrant serious mention and anyway he said we have nt any eggs following the directions of the english girl smith cut a number of chops from the carcass and these the three grilled on pointed sticks that lady barbara had had him cut from a nearby tree how long will it take to cook them demanded smith i could eat mine raw i could eat the whole kid raw for that matter in one sitting and have room left for the old nanny i missed we ll eat only enough to keep us going said lady barbara then we ll wrap the rest in the skinpand take it with us if we re careful this should keep us alive for three or four days of course you re right admitted lafayette you always are you can have a because you ve been longer without food than we you have had nothing for a long time barbara said jezebel i am the one who needs the least we all need it now said lafayette let s have good meal this time get back our strength and then ration the balance so that it will last several days maybe i will sit on something else before this is gone they all laughed and presently the chops were done and the three fell to upon them like starving armenians was the simile smith suggested occupied with the delightful business of appeasing woolfish hunger none of them saw eshbaal halt behind a tree and observe them jezebel he recognized for what she was and a sudden fire lighted his blue eyes the others were enigmas to him especially their strange apparel of one thing eshbaal was convinced he had found his lost kid and there was wrath in three then he glided back into the forest until he was out of their sight when he broke into a run the meal finished smith wrapped the remainder of he carcass in the skin of the kid and the three again ook up their search for the fissure an hour passed and then another still their efforts were not crowned with success they saw nopopening in the stern forbidding face of the escarpment nor did they see the slinking figures creeping steadily nearer and nearer a score of stocky yellow haired men led by eshbaal the shepherd we must have passed it said smith at last it just can not be this far south yet only a hundred yards farther on lay the illusive opening into the great fissure we shall have to hunt for some other way out of the valley then said lady barbara there is a place farther south that jezebel and i used to see from the mouth of our scaled let s have a try at it then said smith say look there he pointed toward the north what is it where demanded jezebel i thought i saw a man s head behind that rock said smith yes there he is again lord look at em they re all around eshbaal and his fellows realizing that they were discovered came into the open advancing slowly toward the three the men of north midian exclaimed jezebel are they not beautiful what shall we do demanded lady barbara we must not let them take us we ll see what they want said smith they may not be unfriendly anyway we could nt escape them by running they would overtake us in no time get behind me and if they show any signs of attack ing i perhaps you had better go out and sit on them suggested lady barbara wearily i am sorry said smith that my marksmanship is so poor but unfortunately perhaps it never occurredto my parents to train me in the gentle art of murder i realize now that they erred and that my education has been sadly neglected i am only a school teacher and in teaching the young intellect to shoot i have failed to learn to do so myself i did nt intend to be nasty said lady barbara who detected in the irony of the man s reply a suggestion of wounded pride please forgive me the north midians were advancing cautiously halting occasionally for brief whispered conferences presently one of them spoke addressing the three who are you he demanded what do you in the land of midian can you understand him asked smith over his shoulder speaks the same language as jezebel s people explained lady barbara he wants to know who we are and what we are doing here you talk to him lady barbara said smith the english girl stepped forward we are strangers in midian she said

comes byron talks in a flat level voice it was a strange place where a man would be where the chance to do harm could not have found him it would have been out there at the mill on a saturday evening and with the house burning too right in my face you might say it was like all the time i was eating dinner and i would look up now and then and see that smoke and i would think well i wont see a soul out here this evening anyway i ai nt going to be interrupted this evening at least and then i looked up and there she was with her face all fixed for smiling and with her mouth all fixed to say his name when she saw that i was nt him and i never knowed any better than to blab the whole thing he grimaces faintly it is not a smile his upper lip just lifts momentarily the movement even the surface wrinkling travelling no further and vanishing almost at once i was not the worst of it it must have been a strange thing that could keep byron bunch in jefferson over sunday hightower says but she was looking for him and you helped her to find him was nt what you did what she wanted what she had come all the way from alabama to find i reckon i told her all right i reckon it ai nt any question about that with her watching me sitting there swolebellied watching me with them eyes that a man could not have lied to if he had wanted and me blabbing on with that smoke right yonder in plain sight like it was put there to warn me to make me watch my mouth only i never had the sense to see it oh hightower says the house that burned yesterday but i do nt see any connection between whose house was it i saw the smoke myself and know that old burden house byron says he looks at the other they look at one another hightower is a tall man and he was thin once but he is not thin now his skin is the color of flour sacking and his upper body in shape is like a loosely filled sack falling from his gaunt shoulders of its own weight upon his lap then byron says you ai nt heard yet the other watches him he says in a musing tone that would be for me to do too to tell on two days to two folks something they ai nt going to want to hear and that they had nt ought to have to hear at all what is this that you think i will not want to hear what is it that i have not heard not the fire byron says they got out of the fire all right they again byron looks at the other for a moment but hightower s face is merely grave and interested brown and christmas byron says still hightower s face does not change in expression you ai nt heard that even byron says they lived out there lived out there they boarded in the house no in a old nigger cabin in the back christmas fixed it up three years ago he s been living in it ever since with folks wondering where he slept at night then when him and brown set up together he took brown in with him oh hightower said but i do nt see if they were comfortable and miss burden did nt i reckon they got along they were selling whiskey using that old place for a headquarters a blind i do nt reckon she knew that about the whiskey leastways they say that christmas started it by himself three years ago just selling to a few regular customers that did nt even know one another but when he took brown in with him i reckon brown wanted to spread out selling it by the half a pint out of his shirt bosom in any alley and to anybody selling what he never drunk that is and i reckon the way they got the whiskey they sold would not have stood much looking into because about two weeks after brown quit out at the mill and taken to riding around in that new car for his steady work he was down town drunk one saturday night and bragging to a crowd in the barbershop something about him and christmas in memphis one night or on a road close to memphis something about them and that new car hid in the bushes and christmas with a pistol and a lot more about a truck and a hundred gallons of something until christmas come in quick and walked up and christmas saying in that quiet voice of his that ai nt pleasant and ai nt mad either you ought to be careful about drinking so much of this jefferson hair tonic it s gone to your head first thing you know you ll have a hairlip holding brown up he was with one hand and slapping his face with the other they did nt look like hard licks but the folks could see the red even through brown s whiskers when christmas hand would come away between licks you come out and get some fresh air christmas says you re keeping these folks from working he muses he speaks again and there she was siting there on them staves watching me and me blabbing the whole thing to her and her watching me and then she says did he have a little white scar right here by his mouth and brown is the man hightower says he sits motionless there is nothing militant in it nothing of outraged morality it is as though he were listening to the doings of people of a different race her husband a bootlegger well
russian circle gathered about once a week and though john had been invited many times he never found the time or the courage to go and sit among those tragic figures over whose intellectual revels nina presided with the simplicity and grace of an exiled queen he had echoes of their discussions and noticed an occasional fatuity straight out of madame blavatsky but he reflected that the background of a man s history is what colors his allusions and he wondered how his heritage of lord cornwallis in a red coat cooper s indians kit carson emerson s faded posies whitman s urgings and bryan s philippics impressed those foreigners and though he was an american his immediate ancestors were german and irish his childhood surroundings of a cosmopolitan air helped him to understand the russians or at least sympathize with them his prussian grandfather a rotund and at the same time chic personage insisted that john as a child greet him in three languages every time they it were a piece of etiquette after which commonplaces could be taken up there was a professor of physics at the university whom nina liked and whom john liked because he resembled this grandparent at one of the parties of that time she and he had gone off into a discussion of a molecular conception of the deity which nina enlivened with proofs derived from a human experience with fate was god for reason zat scientists admit control of universe by some force ach so said the professor fondling his beard aber this force is not necessarily god madame so you call it one thing i another is same thing god replied nina with one of her saddest and most convincing smiles there was no refutation for that sort of argument and the professor nodded profoundly allowing nina to lean back among her cushions with an honest sense of victory george the world of me and believe me in my life we have a great chance there he said seriously for a great work we re educating the public to good music why every new score i arrange i slip in first rate stuff and the public s none the wiser he sat back with an effect of triumph he talked on for half an hour painting a gorgeous picture of the tremendous advance he had made spiritually he said that the movies were the widest expression of contemporary america what a grand thing it was to be in it what a chance to develop art along with the machine age where he had read this mechanistic philosophy john could guess all the magazines were full of it and doore said the monitor had a page devoted to serious discussion of movies and their problems he touched john deeply he began to wonder if he had been wrong about him how could he have taken doore s earnest enthusiasm his childlike simplicity for anything like prodded him along with questions feeling guilty for his old hatred and trying by stimulating helps to rebuild doore s personality in the direction he adored they got up presently and left the restaurant and started to walk home along the quieting main street with its electric signs winking and announcing in a still sky for the benefit of an empty street the corner arc lamps burned and enflamed street cars and late taxicabs it was near midnight a good hour john reflected for conversation as they walked doore returned to the swami i hope nina was there he said was she there john said remembering how he had watched her during the two hours of the lecture was she i ll have fun talking it over with her tomorrow you know i see lots of her nowadays doore said with a wink i know she has told me is she sweet well kid i m telling you he leered around at john s face she s got everything john stopped and stared at him what the hell do you mean he said furiously now listen doore said putting his hand on john s arm placatingly do nt get jealous jack john felt strangled you son of a bitch he said loudly and pushed george into the gutter george stared with amazement and then john began walking rapidly cursing him in his heart and griped to his belly by the fact that he had been decent to doore as shortly ago as ten minutes doore ran after him crouching and laughing nervously through his words listen i did nt mean get the hell away from me john said walking on doore paused and laughed and cleared his nose several times inwardly noisily and then his eyes wishing that he had hit doore and that doore had hit him john took his way homeward to mrs bliss s what to do should he tell nina or tell val or tell blanche and let it simmer through to them less painfully had doore been talking generally where had julia heard the scandal she had referred to weeks ago at the club were people gossiping what did mr ganson say only today i ve been told you are with her a very great deal some people find this shocking good god was nina safe from no tongue john railed against the standards that made it impossible for him to champion her person and her name he was very tired when he got home when his key scratched in the door mrs bliss flung it open and deposited her head upon his bosom a wet handkerchief to her swollen nose and a prayer of thankfulness in her stricken eyes oh what is the matter she drew him into his bedroom where she had the light on and sat with him on his bed heaving with terrible sobs rubbing the swelling of headache and grief on her brow it s martin her son but her air of mystery finally resolved itself as
in his bed he had gambled away a great sum ai yah fortune had not attended him the entirety of his master s increase must fall into his hands if he were to pay his debts the number two houseboy must be hired and the extra coolie so he could receive part of their wages from everything that came into the house he must take an extra commission and missie must buy more how could he teach her to want more in this he had not yet succeeded when he tried to embroideries the little trinkets the laces the bronzes she bought sparingly as a man would buy the little heat was passed the great heat drew on toward its fulness day after day no rain fell and the second rice began to turn yellow before its time the water that had been garnered in reservoirs was fed to the fields and along the streams and the river all night the feet of men walked the endless treads of the chain pumps then except along the river the foot pumps were still for there was no more water in reservoir or stream in the city there came a time when the water taken from the wells was thin mud each day the line of water carriers at the river grew longer in a lengthening queue they moved over the river bank a thin yellow band in the distance the farmers idle now moved along the alley like streets of the city along the bund crowding the sampans across the river they would petition their gods for rain what did the gods want reverence three steps and we kneel sacrifice hooks hung in our flesh that the gods may see and give us a little rain in order that our sons may live no meat or fowls or eggs sold in the city no life of any kind taken except for the sacrifice of bull and ram made by the governor stephen walking daily through the city watched the money market grow tight the price of rice go up in many small shops men sat idle it startled him to see how small was the margin on which the people of the valley bought how quickly it was wiped out in his offices although they had wages and would not starve clerk junkman and coolie squeezed as they had never squeezed before they seemed to partake of the common fear stephen forgot the delight of his intellectual adventure in exploring the chinese mind forgot his was unconsciously one with those around him some instinct within him vibrating to the fundamental calamity when he found the office coolie palming stamps from letters he did not dismiss him as he would have done a month ago and although he watched now more closely than ever to keep down the squeeze it was in a new mood not with the censoriousness of an outsider but with the sympathy he would have felt looking upon a like manifestation among his own people stephen tried to keep from hester that there was danger of famine high at the top of the hong sheltered secluded she failed to understand the full significance of the drought she saw only a gay pageant moving across the bund peasants with yellow knapsacks bound for the temples the gods decked in bright red robes riding in chairs on the shoulders of men who carried them out to view the metallic sky the bright sterile clouds finding delight in sound and movement she grew excited over the spectacle activity she knew not what and when kin came saying a white pedlar stood outside with a bundle greatly big she welcomed the diversion it was a russian tall and gaunt who entered at kin s bidding kneeling by his pack he took from it rugs glowing in color soft as silk hester coveting the most beautiful of the rugs began bargaining seeing in the man s eagerness the desire to sell at any price she had just completed her bargain when stephen came at her summons to pay the man he looked at hester vivid with the excitement of possession bright spots in her cheeks he heard the sounds coming up from the bund bang bang men beating upon brass gongs a frenzy of gongs propitiation of the gods the heavens he knew not which but he knew that it was desperate entreaty to end the drought famine at the doors and hester buying a costly rug hong s full of company rugs but they re so ugly stephen look at this one on the floor it s got two darns in it the new one would look lovely in this room she laid her hand on the soft surface of the rug we ca nt hester why not she demanded feeling resentment over his unwillingness remembering his substantial increase because there s famine the pent up strain under which stephen had been laboring broke its bounds when there s famine the people ca nt buy this is my first managership i have nt made good yet my whole future is built on sales i do nt know yet how bad the famine will be how far it s going to spread maybe over the whole province suppose the sales drop instead of increasing the company sees no extenuating circumstances either i win or i lose suppose i lose hester sat back on her heels but i did nt know stephen he was angry with himself he had not wanted to shatter hester s sense of security it was for that he was working better buy the rug i guess we can swing it he added hastily we have nt famine yet i m probably borrowing trouble hester looked at stephen as he counted out the money but her pleasure in her purchase was gone famine looked out at her she remembered the trek of the peasants in manchuria their faces that was
wanted the bell within reach she had the feeling well known to her of settling herself in the saddle for a formidable jump he sha nt touch me anyway she thought she heard blore s voice say sir gerald corven my lady quaint announcing a husband to his wife but staff knew everything without looking she saw perfectly well where he was standing a surge of shamed anger stained her cheeks he had fascinated her he had used her as every kind of plaything he had one more river his voice cuttingly controlled said well my dear you were very sudden neat and trim as ever and those daring despoiling eyes what do you want only yourself you ca nt have me absurd he made the quickest kind of movement and seized her in his arms clare bent her head back and put her finger on the bell move back or i ring and she put her other hand between his face and hers stand over there and i ll talk to you otherwise you must go very well but it s ridiculous oh do you think i should have gone if i had nt been in earnest i thought you were just riled and i do nt wonder i m sorry it s no good discussing what happened i know you and i m not coming back to you my dear you have my apology and i give you my word against anything of the sort again how experiment some women adore it if not at the time you are a beast and beauty married me come clare do nt be silly and make us a laughing stock you can fix your own conditions and trust you to keep them besides that s not my idea of a life i m only twenty four one more river the smile left his lips i see i noticed a young man come out of this house name and estate tony croom well he walked over to the window and after a moment s contemplation of the street turned and said you have the misfortune to he my wife so i was thinking quite seriously clare come back to me quite seriously no i have an official position and i ca nt play about with it look at me he me but i m neither a humbug nor old fashioned i do nt trade on my position or on the sanctity of marriage or any of that stuff but they still pay attention to that sort of thing in the service and i ca nt afford to let you divorce me i did nt expect it what then i know nothing except that i m not coming back just because of and a great deal else the cat like smile had come back and prevented her from reading what he was thinking do you want me to divorce you clare shrugged you have no reason so you would naturally say and mean now look here clare this is all absurd and quite unworthy of any one with your sense and knowledge of things you ca nt be a perpetual grass widow you did nt dislike the life out there things that ca nt be done to me and you have done them i ve said that they sha nt be done again and i ve said that i ca nt trust you this is going round the mulberry bush are you going to live on your people no i ve got a job oh what secretary to our new member you ll be sick of that in no time i do nt think so he stood staring at her without his smile for a moment she could read his thoughts for his face had the expression which preludes sex suddenly he said i wo nt stand for another man having you it was a comfort to have seen for once the bottom of his mind she did not answer did you hear me yes i meant it i could see that i wish i had been he took a turn up and down the room and came to a stand dead in front of her look at me i m not going back without you i m staying at the bristol be sensible there s a darling and come to me there we ll start again i ll be ever so nice to you her control gave way and she cried out oh for god s sake understand you killed all the feeling i had for you o one more river his eyes dilated and then narrowed his lips became a line he looked like a horse breaker and understand me he said very low you either come back to me or i divorce you i wo nt leave ou here to kick your heels i m sure you ll have the approval of every judicious husband the smile reappeared on his lips for to have a kiss and before she could stop him he had fastened his lips on hers she tore herself away and pressed the bell he went quickly to the door flu revoir he said and went out clare wiped her lips she felt bewildered and exhausted and quite ignorant whether to him or to her the day had gone she stood leaning her forehead on her hands over the fire and became aware that sir lawrence had come back and was considerately saying nothing awfully sorry uncle i shall he in my digs next week have a cigarette my dear clare took the cigarette and inhaled its comfort her uncle had seated himself and she was conscious of the quizzical expression of his eyebrows conference had its usual success clare nodded the elusive formula the fact is human beings are never satisfied with what they do nt want however cleverly it s put is it so far as i m concerned pity there are always two parties
for writing the pamphlets that is to say a bottle of champagne and a free fuck in one of the egyptian rooms if i succeeded in bringing a client i was to get my commission just like kepi got his in the old days one night i brought van norden he was going to let me earn a little money by enjoying himself upstairs but when the madame learned that he was a newspaperman she would nt hear of champagne again and a free fuck i got nothing out of it as a matter of fact i had to write the story for him because he could nt think how to get round the subject without mentioning the kind of place it was one thing after another like that i was getting fucked good and proper the worst job of all was a thesis i undertook to write for a deaf and dumb psychologist a treatise on the care of crippled children my head was full of diseases and braces and workbenches and fresh air theories it took about six weeks off and on and then to rub it in i had to proofread the goddamned thing it was in french such a french as i ve never in my life seen or heard but it brought me in a good breakfast every day an american breakfast with orange juice oatmeal cream coffee now and then ham and eggs for a change it was the only period decent breakfast thanks to the crippled children of rockaway beach the east side and all the coves and inlets bordering on these sore points then one day i fell in with a photographer he was making a collection of the slimy joints of paris for some degenerate in munich he wanted to know if i would pose for him with my pants down and in other ways i thought of those skinny little runts who look like bellhops and messenger boys that one sees on pornographic post cards in little bookshop windows occasionally the mysterious phantoms who inhabit the rue de la lune and other malodorous quarters of the city i did nt like very much the idea of advertising my physiog in the company of these elite but since i was assured that the photographs were for a strictly private collection and since it was destined for munich i gave my consent when you re not in your home town you can permit yourself little liberties particularly for such a worthy motive as earning your so squeamish come to think of it even in new york there were nights when i was so damned desperate back there that i had to go out right in my own neighborhood and panhandle we did nt go to the show places familiar to the tourists but to the little joints where the atmosphere was more congenial where we could play a game of cards in the afternoon before getting down to work he was a good companion the photographer he knew the city inside out the walls particularly he talked to me about goethe often and the days of the hohenstaufen and the massacre of the jews during the reign of the black death interesting subjects and always related in some obscure way to the things he was doing he had ideas for scenarios too astounding ideas but nobody had the courage to execute them the sight of a horse split open like a saloon door would inspire him to talk of dante or leonardo da vinci or jump into a cab and rush me to the trocadero museum in order to point out a skull or a mummy that had fascinated him we explored the th the th the th and the th arrondissements thoroughly our favorite resting places were lugubrious little spots such as the place nationale place des peupliers place de la contrescarpe place paul verlaine many of these places were already familiar to mc but all of them i now saw in a different light owing to the rare flavor of his conversation if today i should happen to stroll down the rue du chateau des rentiers for example inhaling the fetid stench of the hospital beds with which the th arrondissementreeks my nostrils would undoubtedly expand with pleasure because compounded with that odor of stale piss and formaldehyde there would be the odors of our imaginative voyages through the charnel house of europe which the black death had created through him i got to know a spiritual minded individual named kruger who was a sculptor and painter kruger took a shine impossible to get away from him once he discovered that i was willing to listen to his esoteric ideas there are people in this world for whom the word esoteric seems to act as a divine ichor like settled for herr peeperkorn of the magic mountain kruger was one of those saints who have gone wrong a masochist an anal type whose law is scrupulousness rectitude and conscientiousness who on an off day would knock a man s teeth down his throat without a qualm he seemed to think i was ripe to move on to another plane a higher plane as he put it i was ready to move on to any plane he designated provided that one did nt eat less or drink less he chewed my head off about the threadsoul the causal body ablation the upanishads plotinus krishnamurti the karmic vestiture of the soul the nirvanic consciousness all that flapdoodle which plague sometimes he would go into a trance and talk about his previous incarnations how he imagined them to be at least or he would relate his dreams which so far as i could see were thoroughly insipid prosaic hardly worth even the attention of a freudian but for him there were vast esoteric marvels hidden in their depths which i had to aid him to decipher he had turned himself inside out like

i think that we were better off when a man was expected to do right and people were shocked if he did nt today a man seems to be expected to do wrong and it s considered rather ingenuous to be shocked well i do nt know about all that eric cadbury said but it sounds good it seems to me the case is whether doc bull ought to be allowed to get away with taking his salary and not doing his job i do nt know who expects what but unless you re a tammany democrat in new york city i guess you more or less expect to be out of a job if they catch you not doing it in any big way i think you ll find the ayes have it herbert matthew herring said now as you say there s a good chance that we ca nt successfully indict way what can we do about persuading the county health officer to remove him eric cadbury his eyes puckered up shrewdly said hold on that s the wrong end of the stick if you want to get at him you d better get at the eighteen hundred a year the school committee pays him to be medical examiner we ll get at that matthew herring said it so happens that he has a certain support on the school commit tee i do nt plan to treat with it because it would simply boil down to some sort of political deal with the democrats as long as mr harris controls the democratic policies any decent or honest relationship is obviously impossible i want to get at it another way go on matthew said mr banning i m not consistent enough to object now for some reason i do nt mind cutting half a man s throat it s what you want herbert matthew herring said is not to get blood on your hands i m afraid i mean because you do nt like blood not because you intend to fool anybody now doctor lefferts has always tacitly supported doctor bull and he will support him to the last ditch it s just a professional matter making common cause against the laymen what we have to look for is the last ditch and continue the discussion there yes lucile made some experiments she discovered that there was nt a great deal to be done well the strength of doctor lefferts position lies in the fact that a complaint or so carries no weight you can shrug it off you imply that every one is perfectly satisfied except a few cranks nothing can satisfy the medical profession understands that it s been suffering from a few cranks for centuries but i think if you could show that every one in throwing doctor bull overboard now walter mr bates jerked his finger away from the scalloped shell i m listening he said quickly what would you think of calling a town meeting say next saturday that s the fourteenth i want to have sev eral resolutions presented for adoption to the general effect that doctor bull has been grossly negligent and incompetent and is unfit to hold his office if we could get two or three hundred signatures and send the resolutions along with a petition signed by all the town officers to doctor lefferts i think lefferts would remove him i do nt doubt he would eric cadbury admitted but how about the school committee that s a matter for the board of education the district superintendent would be within his rights and i know him well enough to be able to say he would exercise his rights in objecting to the employment of any unfit person dismissed from a medical office for carelessness and incompetence would certainly come in the class of unfit persons what the school committee agreed on or did nt agree on would nt matter doctor bull would simply be removed from the field of discussion say that s pretty neat eric cadbury said any objections herbert i have none walter bates said uneasily yes but do nt you think maybe we ought to wait until later i mean you mean said mr banning that doctor bull is the only doctor in town probably he is better than none so let s be sure we have some one else before we annoy him too greatly i m not very happy about this matthew the state health department would step in if necessary matthew herring said there s no reason to worry about that as a matter of fact i ve spoken to doctor verney in to help at least temporarily and he gave me the name of a doctor moses in torrington i did nt explain the situation to him but it seems that there d be no difficulty i do nt mean to imply that any of this is going to make any one very happy herbert i d suggest that you sacrifice your happiness in the common cause you score admitted mr banning smiling briefly you are nt planning to go all the way home for luncheon are you better stay here i m expecting doctor verney he s been busy helping doctor bull with the inoculations well we ll be going eric cadbury said i m sure you re with us mr banning i ca nt be anywhere else it seems yes of course you have my support for what it s worth how s geraldine today walter she s pretty i know what you mean he said unexpectedly i mean if it would do any good it seems kind of late somehow that s what takes the heart out of you
the hills to the river and spent the hours there and these sundays there were nine of them were all perfect save one in the calm morning of this day while night was still a faint fog in cove and glade they were going down antelope creek they left the road and turned into a river lane and climbed a hill and upon looking back they saw a man filling his tank from the creek he was a farmer and he was hauling water to his beasts who care but when he looked at neloa he saw that her eyes were curiously alive and with unerring penetration born of loneliness and self searching he read in her eyes in something strangely shadowed there a warm alert interest in this man his world darkened as if the sun of his happiness had passed into a cloud he grasped her shoulders and looked at her eyes but what he had seen there was gone and then she amazed him by saying i know who he is who who is asked vridar beginning to feelt she inclined her head to the distant man heked at her and at the man at one and then at thecher and he wondered what her words meant and the man was now looking at them well who is he francis henderson oh you do nt say well who s francis hen rson he lives over there she man now waved to neloa and she returnedgreeting and jealousy rose in vridar in a vomit of rage it choked him and for a few moments left him speechless he stared at neloa sick with doubt in perceiving now that he was furious she changed suddenly in the manner of a playing child that is baked something strange entered her eyes and c smile left her mouth let s go on she said no vridar said he was determined to settle is matter now how long you known him oh about a year you been out with him his face was so morally earnest that she shrank and looked scared yes she said i low many times only once only once when was that oh she sighed about two months ago how long before before you came up weeks she was annoyed her voice trembled now and there was dark resentment in her eyes do you love him do nt be silly she said and her eyes for a moment were like fire vridar had never seen this neloa before he was touching depths that he had suspected but had never found he drew a long breath feeling that he was silly beyond all doubt she had gone with him once she had waved to him in greeting but these surely were no matters to get furious about he took her arm and they walked again she was pensive and sullen now if he pressed her arm she gave no response and he wished deeply that he had not been such a fool i m sorry he said he looked round trying to meet her eyes there was an angry dying flush in her cheeks there was something hard and glittering in her stare i love you so you were mean she said all right anything but let s not spoil our sunday neloa please she did not sigh or in any way betray her thought her face was still brooding and dark he stopped and drew her resisting to his arms and she put her hands up and strove to push him away neloa please i m awful sorry honest please do nt spoil our day she looked at him and he didpnot like what he saw in her eyes he had seen it in her father s eyes he had never discovered what it meant neloa he cried becoming frantic what she asked and looked far away neloa do nt you love me now she hesitated a long while neloa do nt you i guess so she said then please neloa please smile no yes please i said no he drew her to him again and she did not resist now he kissed her lips and eyes smile he said i ll kiss you until you smile she looked at him and very slowly she smiled the darkness left her eyes andere came in its stead a whimsical humor that he loved now we re all right he said neloa are nt we but not for hours did he recover the lyric sweetness of their former days something troubled her her gayness never bright or spontaneous touched her but lightly now and her eyes again and again were shadowed and still but he reposed in her largely because his need was so great the simplicity and the trust that were the heart of his life and another incident also trifling it seemed to him on reflection he saw her only on the sundays of these weeks but on the mormon holiday the twenty fourth of july he mounted his pony and rode forth telling himself with enormous glee that he would surprise her when he came within sight of her home he stopped he saw neloa in the yard and she saw him too it seemed because at once she dodged round a building and entered the house he rode down the lane and through the gate after greeting her parents who stood in the yard and looked at him as they always did rather curiously he threw the reins over a post and went to the door is neloa inside he asked yes said tim doole he pushed the door open and strode in neloa was lying on a bed she seemed to be asleep but he knew she was not nevertheless when he spoke to her she did not answer and when he went over and sat on he said you re not asleep she affected to wake and to be astonished she stared at him
warm velvet seat feeling the difficulties before her if she was to keep her memory of perfection forever secure and undiminished a strapping young fellow in coveralls came toward the car with his blond hair glinting oh you folks are together he nodded toward the oil station his grin with the flash of white teeth in the tanned grease smudged face had an easy friendly understanding and acceptance margot saw bruce s firm large figure as he leaned with one elbow on the counter having an earnest masculine confabulation with the oil station man over a spread out map and the pride of their being together was almost more than she could endure the young fellow thumped a tire he was sticking around because he admired her but admiration came easy now that she no longer needed it not had this car very long have you margot smiled and shook her head in her brown tweed suit and light felt hat and the scuffed comfortable easy grace of her laced prince of wales shoes she had a flattering consciousness of herself as an impressively urban figure out here in the anonymous countryside i saw it was a new car it sure lot of service too he nodded and tapped the hood in appreciation new york looks like you folks are a good ways from home going out to the coast just driving sure well that s the way to do it he grinned at her again and went off margot could see the gestures of the two men inside the building their movements had a pleasant earthy slowness behind the sunny glare of the large front window with a subtle smile of feminine contentment margot sat back to wait and let them settle the question of the roads between themselves now with her head resting against the soft upholstery and her bare hands folded she could feel the sense of anonymous country leisure widening around her in the sunshine a good ways from home the young fellow had said new york seemed more incredibly far away to margot than it must seem to him only that speeding stream of noisily place with any memory of the city and even the cars were more widely spaced than they had been she thought of new york standing incredibly on its island like some separate walled city tall and feudal and feverishly modern existing in and for itself a crazy pattern of streets and buildings and rushing people caught in the thundering network of trains above and below the life was a fevered half mad half splendid dream existing within the dream on its own terms of terrible immediacy people had to believe in it to the exclusion of all other existence get outside and it was incredible margot felt the slow beginning sweetness of a kind of reconciliation to the land the rough dry ground smelled good a tuneless music thrilled along the telephone wires now it seemed that a great space that was more than just miles of country lay between her and all the life she had known up until now she looked at bruce standing big easy and absorbed all over again the wonder of the richness with which his love had endowed her adding to her what he was filling out the empty places of her own being all that had been rudimentary and fragmentary in her experience was miraculously fulfilled even her silly old notions about dr redmond at home about having an affair with a married man the need for someone big and competent in a worldly way that perhaps she had got from her old admiration of frank and sybil and her dissatisfaction with the folks the desire for the shock and delight of what was different from herself that had first been aroused when she had seen jesse and dorothy exchanging their bridal kiss at this moment margot s life seemed to her an illuminated landscape in which all the lines were in perfect focus bruce reached out and put his forefinger on a spot on the map there was something personal in that little gesture something that she recognized as bruce something dominating of hot possession it frightened her threatening her ideal conception of love which dictated that it must end when it was over her fear seemed suddenly to strike her with a distant vicious hatred of the shadowy figure of the wife who must have seen that very movement who knew the brief accurately judging squint with which bruce sized up a hill before they came to it the way in which he accomplished everything with that satisfyingly competent minimum of movement she wanted to blast the woman into forgetfulness to scorn her out of existence with a piercing overflow of jealousy margot seized bruce s heavy driving glove that he had thrust into a pocket of the upholstery and pressed it up against her face but an hour of yesterday was something that only she herself and bruce would ever know margot felt that it had annulled everything that went before it the men whom she had known before she knew bruce seemed to have been washed out of existence was now it was this moment sunny and still in the great slow drift of time and she was living in it bruce came out still looking thoughtfully at the map he spread it open against the wheel margot fidgeted in her seat she felt a qualm of the minutely vigilant fear which still had to keep its strained hold beneath the surface of her happiness she sat scarcely breathing if they had already had the best of their love and bruce was beginning to forget about her then it had to be and to try to do anything would be only a violation bruce s right hand slipped down from the wheel and groped softly and blindly for hers she felt the even clasp everything swung into focus again
of the crew were dividing their time between the catching of eels and the exchange of hoarse pleasantries with the occupants of small boats engaged in the sale of onions checked shirts flatfish apple brandy red wine lace and mussels with reluctance they abandoned their fishing removed the hatch and fell to swaying bales on deck in preparation for the afternoon s unloading marvin having put them to work inspected the galley and the forecastle examined the guns with a mind to having them scraped and repainted then still with the thought cabin to look for spots that would be better for a brushful the cabin was divided into two sections and it was the smaller of these that corunna still occupied at its door marvin hesitated but only for a moment there seemed to him when he entered to be something of corunna about this small white room with its standing bedplace and its wide lockers an air of sturdiness and crispness drawn over the bedplace was a patchwork quilt that almost glittered in the brilliance of its colors and folded neatly on it lay her needlework that worsted work of art representing the holy family gazing with suspicion at the towers of jerusalem marvin touching it gingerly with his forefinger smiled a little from it there seemed to rise a faint fragrance of sweet grass and mallow such as had come to him so often from the arundel meadows on summer nights he stared up at the ceiling and around at the white panels of this neat small cabin then moved to the a chinese courting mirror over it and a swinging whale oil lamp of pewter and copper with small paintings of her mother and father on either side the painting of her mother marvin thought would be corunna to the life if in place of the low black dress edged at the neck with wooden seeming lace the portrait showed her in a stained and darned chinese jacket with a collar that came high up around her throat and fastened with three jade buttons he slipped the oval frame from its hook through the tightly drawn black hair gleamed a white ear tip the lips seemed to tremble on the verge of a smile in the smooth column of the throat as marvin studied it there was almost the beating of a pulse he touched the pictured throat gently with his finger the scent of sweet grass and mallow came to him again and the face at which he looked softened and became charming as had corunna s on that night off rio he lifted he guiltily raised his eyes to his reflection in the mirror reflected also in the mirror was the stern window and through the mirrored window he saw far down the estuary a tall black schooner beating up on the rising tide from the channel close hauled on the larboard tack he quickly hung the picture in its place turned to the window and examined the rig and cut of the distant vessel despite the briskness of the southwest breeze she rode stiff in the water heeling over so little that no part of her copper showed if indeed there was copper on her she was marvin felt too large for a smuggler and he knew as well that there was scarce a smuggler in either france or england but use a either a lugger or a cutter in his trade in preference to a schooner she might he told himself be a french privateer but it was doubtful since her top hamper was lacking in delicacy to his mind distance he could see from the spread of her ratlines that she carried more shrouds and backstays than diron and argandeau would consider needful and it was plain that she was rigged for strength rather than for great speed furthermore she showed no colors which seemed to him unusual for a vessel entering a home port after a cruise vaguely uneasy but more curious than uneasy he took corunna s telescope from the rack beside her bedplace and went on deck where a score of bales had risen from the hold to clutter the amidships section increasingly uneasy he mounted to the mizzen top and focused the glass on the schooner which had come about on the far side of the estuary she was pointing downstream from the olive branch but from the set of the tide it appeared to marvin that when the stranger next came about she would be abreast of the barque through the glass he could see guns on her deck which was nothing strange and her ports the guns so that she looked peaceable enough he was a fool he told himself to be disturbed over a harmless merchantman running home nc doubt with rum and sugar from martinico and with that he polished the lenses of the glass with a fold of his shirt and stared even harder at her from far behind him he heard a hail a boat he saw was bobbing toward the olive branch from the direction of morlaix a boat with three men in it as he looked the man in the stern sheets rose to his feet pointing and waving toward the oncoming schooner and hailed again marvin saw with a faint trembling in the pit of his stomach that the man was argandeau what it was that he shouted marvin could not hear nor did he need to hear phis thoughts churned in his head like wheels spinning in butter if i can pile her up on shore he thought she but do nt have time i m making it easier to lose her he cast a quick glance at the schooner to marvin the mile wide estuary seemed to have shrunk in size the white cottages on the far shore so distant until now must he thought have drawn near to stare critically at him the schooner pushing
the bottom of page that it is wiser to take voltaire s advice by cultivating her garden and bringing up her pickaninnies than to spend her life imagining she can find a complete explanation of the universe by laying about her with a knobkerry and what smirt do you infer from that i find in that sentence all highest something very like a formal palinode that after laying about him for some and forty years with his own knobkerry with the shillalah of a peculiarly fine intelligence at least one free thinker did not ever light on a complete explanation of any universe which was populated by both his admirers and your admirers i infer in brief from this sentence that a free thinker think he never so freely and for no matter how many decades may come to notice that he does not know every smirt thing not even at the comparative maturity of his later seventies not even after some forty years of explaining everything with entire lucidity and i believe that every free thinker is called upon by and by to face if but obliquely if only for an instant this surprising outcome the all highest smiled he declared in half chuckling protest come now smirt that appears a great deal to deduce from one sentence yet there may be something in what you say and with your permission i will try another one of those excellent smirt continued this is a state of mind which is reached sooner or later by the best informed no one of us understands everything i myself for example do not know what de witt clinton is thinking about so intently on this united states internal revenue cigarette stamp i do not know why the clock on the front page of the herald tribune is set at twelve minutes after six nor why the king of hearts and the jack of clubs are the only male court cards not to have a mustache nor why a barber s pole should always revolve its three colored spiral downwards what lightness what clan i have often reflected sir would be gained did this pole revolve more aspiringly upwards with the appropriate optimism of its owner s imaginings in regard to the benefits of shampoos and of singeing and of hair tonics these are indeed deep mysteries smirt but we were not talking about shampoos nor do i perceive what hair tonics have to do which i might mention is still selling excellently i was about to observe all highest that every at all rational free thinker must come by and by to questi the main article of his own faith as it was defined by mr gilbert chesterton in the remote days when mr chesterton had genius that because something has satisfied generations of men it must be untrue with a little more experience sir one begins to suspect that not even god can be disposed of by having at him with a knobkerry under such treatment god vanishes it is true but it seems equally true that god may just possibly not find in that special form of address any reason for taking the addresser into his complete confidence after glancing every whither from under his shaggy white brows and after making sure nobody was listening the all highest spoke in a confidential lowered voice saying i admit simply between ourselves smirt that i do not find assault and battery an endearing smirt the all highest confides and i promise you all highest smirt replied reassuringly that i shall never approach you in this fashion i confess to a little dubiety whensoever anybody takes the bleak trouble to point out that through no human logic can be justified your existence sir it occurs to me i mean that before advancing this two edged argument one would be called upon first to justify in logic one s own existence and i have yet to meet the man who could do this come now said the old gentleman as pleased as in the cliche is punch but that is handsomely said you speak well smirt with a broad mindedness which i do not often encounter among modern writers such speaking deserves a reward so to you smirt i will gladly explain everything thereupon the all highest explained everything he explained first about barbers poles and about the king of hearts but without committing himself of clubs and about the herald tribune clock and about de witt clinton then the all highest went on to explain his conduct of the universe and smirt listened with ever growing dismay it does not please you smirt to know that which no mortal man has known before you oh as to that all highest i appreciate your confidence i am honored sir i assure you nor is it quite my province perhaps to dictate to you in these cosmic affairs nevertheless smirt do you speak your mind freely for an instant smirt looked appraisingly at the gray cloudland which spread every whither about them all seemed most satisfactorily chaotic and yet as smirt now knew there was no chaos anywhere it was a defect over which smirt perforce shook his head thereafter smirt answered with urbane self restraint i can but say sir that your methods are out of date the entire system is an anachronism and canons of civilized art i had feared the all highest replied in an apologetic way that my methods could hardly hope for your approval i have read your books of course with vast admiration and some unavoidable envy you and i smirt are creative artists who belong to different schools you should allow for that fact before dismissing my work as of no merit at all but this work of yours all highest as you have confessed to me is government it has a formal plan it is rational it involves the long ago exploded notion of a personal creator all

night he got warmed up and talked by the hour it was either rupert prince he talked about or else the old prince people who had done big things in their day he had nt talked so much in years it was because his nephew was there with him now and he did nt want him to give up the idea of getting ahead in life and for night after night till all hours if he did nt talk it might be the boy would sit back and not try to get ahead at all just as he had done himself just as his own brother had done his nephew was spending altogether too much time down in the cove with his lobster traps in his opinion if he d had his way the boy never would have touched one of the things will had rigged up a boat out of kilter for years he had taken to lobstering and tinkering with boats too easily it was bad it was his father coming out in him all over uncle frank had to do something he was afraid of what was ahead he d fight the father in him with the grandfather and great grandfather with his own cousin rupert he d wake the boy up if talking could do it so he talked to will far into the night till morning more than once the birds would for uncle frank every word he said about the ambitious old princes was like something said against himself he had sat back and taken it easy that was nt what the old fellows had done not by a long shot he did nt have something the old princes had in them gumption get up and go stick to itiveness some modern folks called it guts there were different names for it they all meant the same thing whatever it was it had died in him it had died in his own brother dan daniel did nt know it had and he kept on doing something every minute of his time all day and all the part of the night he was awake he had more work than you could shake a stick at but it was nt the work that got him ahead not the right kind did nt get him anywhere he was dead and done for perhaps will did nt have that thing maybe it had died in young uncle frank would see if he had it in him he d find it out pit was a winter from way back the snow covered menhaden and made prince s cove look black below the drifts of white the raccoons fur was longer and thicker that december than seth judkins had seen it in seventy years it was going to be a hard winter sure enough will went down to his boat one morning and found it frozen into the bay solid he cut away the ice around it and pulled it out on the beach to wait till the ice broke up again it did nt break up so at last he hauled it up on the bank and covered it with fir boughs every morning the edge of the still part of the bay was farther out towards the skyline will borrowed a boat at the landing and took in the last of his traps it was a tough job but he finished it one day in early january when the night and the white new shore to menhaden had gone out so far that the ocean looked like just a narrow wicked dark blue edging away out on the sky even from high up the hill they said down at the post office that it had frozen right out to whaleboat will s father could walk ashore home if he wanted to now will knew he would nt come near the house before the week was out he heard down at the store that his father had been there and gone he had a drag made out of peeled spruce boughs and he had loaded her down with a big supply of provisions will went down to the wharf when nobody was looking his father s tracks were there all right it was just after sunset the light was clearer than day had been the tracks went straight out into the evening glow and disappeared in the haze he would have given anything to follow the tracks out there to the island he pile until the evening glow was gone and the blazing winter stars had begun to come out that night will mastered the whole fifth conjugation of latin verbs will s mother found ears of popcorn hung up in the attic loft it had been hanging there by its braided husks lord knew how many years but it popped all right she made a bowl of popcorn for will and uncle frank that was the night of the big snowstorm a wall of dry powdery snow miles high was moving offshore with the sound of a thousand seething kettles it had begun at noontime it went on steadily without a let up by dusk the white earth had risen up almost to the windowsills of the house uncle frank and will sat by the hearth fire and ate the popcorn and uncle frank told about the night the ariadne had been lost just another such a night as this not ten miles from here on the whaleboat south ledges whaleboat had always five hundred tons she was the pride of samuel prince s heart there was nt a prettier or faster ship between belle isle and the horn samuel prince polished even the yard arms loaded with tea from inner mongolia she was white dew on the mountain tea had fancy names then they had always remembered it in the family samuel had sworn it tasted like its name he had opened up one chest of it

having corley did nt you well they are that s why he fallen asleep while on duty is in town really they ve been together almost constantly sonia was saying to dr norwood you and patricia and they had arranged to see each other this afternoon at must have had a wonderful time this afternoon she came in simply beaming old college friends who kept him so long that elise who and dr norwood purringly pleased and self conscious is rather impulsive thought he had forgotten so she as a cat caught in the cream had replied indeed with was out when he arrived they have nt seen each other such unsuccess at casualness that he had hastened to add since not alone i mean and i observe that there in a confidential tone it was a great day for me sonia is i asked her sonia was continuing teasingly how she danger of a slight frost tonight cannily assisted mr liked the new university library you were to have taken sinclair as dr norwood at that unpropitious moment her there you remember and she looked a bit dazed for turned to make himself agreeable to his hostess we a minute and then said oh that it s quite wonderful occasionally have them nt it i mean we did nt get there drove up to lake middle of may he raised his bushy brows to dr norwood grove instead everything so beautiful marvelous who felt obliged to confess he d never noticed andy i told you the right woman would show up some so that accounted for what was going on at the other end day did nt i she persisted when his reply had been of the table mr corley was proving by his gaiety that so slightly delayed by a sip of consomme dr norwood far as he was concerned there was peace on earth and good grinned amiably nodded an indulgent affirmation and will among men nor did any constraint exist between him self and a fellow creature and miss graham not to be outdone by this geniality was demonstrating a guileless gladness that would have made a surly cynic of pollyanna elise had it appeared been just now in receipt really was an awful blarney and the table gradually drawn into it was making appreciative little noises in confirmation of this tribute which she well deserved for she had indeed sung beautifully and it was no more than fair mrs crandall thought that elise should have the entire stage to herself while she took her bow she accepted the applause very prettily and began re plying to queries the dean s first who wanted to know something about life in little leeds and simpson s who hoped she would give them the high lights on her recent spectacular debut in louisville perhaps it was the pro prietorial complacency of mr corley s expression that determined elise s decision to share her honors with her valued friend nathan parker who she gratefully con ceded was responsible for her success and without whose timely assistance she might have gone on for life unrecog nized she spoke his name softly caressingly tell them about him dear urged mrs she added intimately and with promisinglittle nods to sonia whose eyes she had happened to pick up at the moment well to make a long story of it began elise girlishly ingenuous nathan parker mysteriously dropped in at leeds late last fall on no particular errand accompanied by a valuable red setter i say piped mr talbot s oxonian treble dashed if that is nt odd was nt that the chap s name sir you said would return to claim a dog he d left here yesterday he must have done so while i was out dean harcourt seemed unimpressed by this coincidence returning his attention immediately to miss graham im plying with a nod that her narrative had the right of way simpson was observed to be grinningly mumbling something into phyllis s ear which brought a quick flush to her cheeks and an entreating glance toward sonia whose alert eyes registered a knowledgeable interest but by jove of simpson s you must have seen him miss dexter and the dog too whatever became of him the dog i mean better tell him growled simpson so miss graham can proceed it s his british instinct once he gets hold of an idea you might as well help him work it out for there s no peace until it s no secret said phyllis evenly the dog insisted ongoing along with me when i left and we met mr parker outside then that ca nt possibly be my mr parker commented elise decisively though it is a fact that nathan parker is in town i hope to see him tomorrow but i happen to know that sylvia would nt walk away with anyone sylvia exclaimed several voices in various pitches of incredulity yes and a one man dog if there ever was such an animal if sylvia nt i m sure it would not be a girl she hates women i saw her nearly every day for months and she never thawed out not the least bit mrs crandall thought she observed a little smile playing about phyllis s eyes which were raised to meet sonia s and sonia looking into them was replying with a slow sly wink this whole affair was becoming more complicated every minute that point being cleared up then the dean was re marking quietly mr nathan parker arrived in leeds and and lived at my uncle clay brock s hotel continued elise dryly the interruptions seeming to have dampened her enthusiasm naturally we met and well she hesitated lowered her eyes shyly and groped her way that s about all there is to it nat took an interest in my voice and arranged everything for my recital in louisville and my grandfather liked him so

asked him to go i heard her he had nt wanted to go but he had gone he had nt wanted to drink whisky but he had drunk it when they dared him yet he was always like that when he was a little boy and his mother had whipped him for playing with toby waters he had stood it without a whimper and as soon as it was and over the fields to the pigsty that was what father called ralph s need to defend his personality his whole childhood father said had been warped by forces he did not understand though he felt they were destructive but perhaps grandmother was right when she insisted that she did nt hold with such newfangled ideas and willful children should be made to obey then without effort as soon as she had stopped trying to think things out clearly ada began to live over all that had happened or had not happened to turn eager expectancy into vague disappointment a few hours before in the evening life had been simple and straight and now at midnight it was ruffled and complicated and obscured by this smoky vapor of apprehension and she had wanted life to be simple she had asked nothing more than a certain security for her life for her love for her happiness they were on the back seat in the big wagon charlie draper and willie be waiting for them on the rowans porch when they started down the rocky road the single heart ralph put his arm about her and kissed her in the darkness she remembered the warm pressure of his mouth on hers and she remembered too the roll of the wheels turning within and without and the yellow gleam from the wagon lamp flitting over the tufts of grass and weeds which stood out illuminated each blade or leaf separate and distinct on the edge of obscurity later moonlight would pour down over the hills into the valleys but while they drove on past the churchyard into the village they were swallowed up in the darkness it was a tender darkness soft warm clinging not like this burned out silver light which seemed to drain the world and her own mind of emotion i had hoped we were going alone he murmured as she lived the evening over again she laughed from sheer delight it was your go with janet is it true that some of the boys went up to lightning ridge to buy moonshine he nodded who told you that it was exactly like janet i do nt care so long as you were nt one of them she replied ignoring his question the arm she leaned against hardened slightly a man ca nt be a killjoy he answered that is what you and your father can never understand it is easy to be noble in the woods but among other people it makes you a kill joy his tone had roughened and in some strange way the roughness increased his power over her she felt ecstasy stabbing through her flesh into her heart piercing every cell of her body with tiny splinters of flame why why she could nt tell she did nt know it was nothing that he had vein of ironsaid only the eager seeking of his lips and the ruffled thrilling charm of his mouth his eyes his smile his imperative tone and gestures seemed to envelop her and crush out resistance yes it was true you could not live in the world and be a killjoy how she loved him what a miracle love can make of life nothing else mattered not janet not moonshine whisky not being alone in a crowd then as they stopped before the rowans gate she whispered i hope you will be nice to janet she could feel and see too when a light flashed from the porch that he was smiling oh no you do nt he retorted you do nt really before she had time to answer janet and bessie were calling to them as they ran down the walk and the three boys jumped out of the wagon and flung open the gate charlie held up a lantern and the light danced over janet on her neck she was so lovely that ada caught her breath as she looked at her oh is nt she beautiful does nt her dress suit her to her astonishment ralph was not looking he had turned away and was fumbling with the reins that had dropped from the wagon even when they had all crowded into the wagon and were driving up the street ralph did not turn his eyes from the broad backs of the grays he did not speak until janet leaned over and touched his arm then he looked at her and looked away again before he replied to some trivial question she possessed some power ada felt that ralph despised and resisted but could neither ignore nor deny a boy brought up so severely would always retain some secret allegiance to duty grandmother said no matter how far he wandered even if his senses fell into the single heart sin his conscience would always remind him that it was not pleasure but sin to be rooted more in aversion than in attraction ada wondered whether aunt meggie had meant this when she called janet a born trouble maker somewhere in the fields a hound was howling the small darkened light still shone like a vindictive eye in mrs waters s hovel was the woman ill or in want perhaps toby was sick tomorrow she must tell grandmother or aunt meggie aunt meggie had told her not to bother about mother s salt rising bread which had to be put down at four o clock for a third rising no matter how early she went downstairs grandmother who never slept a wink after the first crack of day was
hopelessly in her power he hungered for a great clean freedom but he was a man in jail pouring whisky upon his curse harboring plots for his own destruction fetching up night after night at the same dead end only once during all his months here did he try to break free he drove with bill and madge and another girl into the country bill and vridar watched them leave the road and crawl through a fence and disappear behind a grove of trees then he turned to maxine allen a sour girl with red hair and put his arms around her but she was like a woman of lead when he touched her breast though she swung to him in fury and slapped his face and for a little while he was too astonished to move what the hell s the matter with you he asked you leave me alone do nt you dare touch me what are you out here for do nt you touch me he grasped her arms and shook her you idiot he cried furiously the girl moved to escape but he broke her across his lap and she was strangely quiet as he held her face to moonlight it was a face almost distorted with passion do nt she said i m not that kind of i do nt like you i would nt do anything with you her quiet scorn infuriated him he shook her again and she wailed with violent hands he shuttled her back and forth and from side to side and she did not resist now she was limp and helpless and he knew that she liked to be manhandled but he did not understand and when overcome again by amazement he stopped to meditate she swung and struck his face she kicked wildly at his legs and yanked his hair what s the matter with you he asked we are betrayedhe crushed her to the bottom of the car and then dragged her up his hands like steel on her naked arms and again she was limp against him and her mouth kissed his throat but the moment he paused in his violence in his experimental attempt to rend her flesh and break her limbs she was at him again her hands like wild things in his face left him speechlessand he crawled out of the car and stared at the girl her mouth was strangely savage and so were her eyes and what sort of person she was he could not imagine he left her sitting here and walked back to town and the more he learned during these months the more he was lost in bewilderment the riddle of life was darker moving week after week among the outcasts studying them eager to know what lay in their hearts he saw them as animals feeding their appetites and exploiting one another and this city he reflected was like other cities and these people the respectable and the outcasts were like people everywhere they were lost in an undecipherable grammar of struggle and greed there was no grandeur here no idealism like acid upon the dross no chastity that was not cowardice no pride that was not arrogant and mean and between the two groups the respectable who stood in sunlight and little difference he had seen harlots give to beggars he had seen bill rummon moist of eye quavering of tongue rebuke a lout who had taunted shorty duff he had seen lawyers perjure themselves and their clients and he had seen a churchman steal and he had seen a bootlegger help an old woman across the street and he himself had felt at times a dark murderous lusting or hatred of the male for the male or wonder childlike and suffering for the lewd and unclean meanings in the meaningless or a wish deep and dark in its sickness to give his life to make the world good in books human beings were not as he found them now in books right was right and wrong waswe are betrayed swrong the hero was a splendid fellow with his thoughts always in the upper half of his torso and the villain was a monstrous wickedness who came to a bad end and he was sick of his life here but there him to pastures where growth was clean this needed a power beyond his own will in a night of august and in a terrible day that followed that power came xviibill rummon came to him at midnight he wanted to go to pocatello he said and when vridar went to his taxi he saw that madge eppert was already there you going too he asked sure i m going she said vridar roared out upon the highway and this midnight ride in a blinding downpour was the most reckless of all his journeys in a car he could barely see through the glass the road was a faintly luminous streak of light but he pushed the gas lever clear to the floor and the car under him was a mad thing roaring through the storm in a little while he saw the wan lights of blackfoot like matches in a fog and then in a moment of terror he saw that the highway swung in a right stop and his speed was too great for the turn he went straight ahead with terrific power and there was a sound of flying stone and of sand in a whirlwind he and rummon got out in downpour the car had driven into a great pile of sand and gravel and had buried itself to the steel frame and every wheel was spinning and after they had spent two hours digging out of this mound vridar lost the highway and plowed through the mud of a country lane came to a halt on a high bank with the car rocking under him got out to explore and fell headlong
she was smart with the smartness of a woman who had been around in the world and had suffered somewhat from the contact yet it was her body that remained her chief asset the tightness of the gown and the way the light reflected from the metal cloth accentuated the mounds of her breasts and reminded him that it was this body dancing in the front row of a musical comedy chorus that had attracted him he was aware of it now well she broke in on his thoughts and he realized that she was watching him with a tolerant half amused gaze he colored slightly but spoke doggedly of the idea which was again foremost in his mind why not call it off a divorce will hestor murdock stiffened slightly i was enjoying myself she said irritably and her eyes were sulky you pick a nice time to bring that up the way it is you may not always be so well satisfied it will be time enough then she started to get up murdock reached out and without pushing kept her from rising he said wait she did not force the issue instead she settled herself again puffed lazily at her cigarette and watched him through the blue haze that hung between them to hestor kent murdock was a paradox he was hard yet mixed with this hardness was a certain refinement of feeling that she could not understand he was intelligent well educated yet he was a newspaper photographer and he liked his job she hated him yet she liked him even now he was attractive to her good looking with a knack of wearing clothes well he had a masculine vitality that had found a responsive chord in her from the first their marriage had been a mistake but she did not regret it what was that she could not hold him not that it mattered she was better off now much better off his weekly payments added to what she made with her radio program enabled her to live as she had dreamed of living in her burlesque days and she had told herself this before this marriage was only an experiment an expedient rather she had known girls in the chorus who had married well profitably such had been her intention to wait until she could be sure of the financial success of such a venture if she could have the thrill of it at the same time so much the better but given the security she could find other outlets for a nature high strung with passion circumstances changed her plans decisively when love song opened in boston an immediate marriage had no place in hestor s thoughts but when it closed on saturday night after a week s try out and the company disbanded she had seized the only chance cigarette to her mouth she did not seize it she made that chance she had met kent murdock at a party after the opening performance on the preceding monday she liked him and she encouraged him during that week he had taken her out nearly every night after the performance yet she had no false ideas about his interest he wanted a good time he had sufficient money to spend she made herself good company but she had experienced that sort of thing before when the show moved on the affair would be forgotten only this time the show would not move on and at the time she had her rent paid in new york for a month and little else the show business was in the doldrums there were no angels no suitable offers of marriage in sight she remembered that saturday night the show closed they d had supper after the performance and gone on to a speak easy she had taken the reins from her affection a little she remembered and it had been she who suggested they get married after she was sure that the half dozen drinks and her methods had made him forget any resolve or inhibition about her he may have had sober his voice checked her thoughts abruptly i m perfectly willing to keep on paying you as alimony hestor murdock ground out her cigarette in an ashtray what she drawled is the reason for the rush rush murdock scowled wrinkles into the bridge of his nose we ve been separated over a year i ve asked you before i know but casually maybe you ve lined up number two murdock waited a moment before he answered when he continued his voice was level there s no one else the point is i want to know where i stand we made a mess of things we both may want another chance some irritation rising again as she reflected how she could not hold him the marriage was an expedient yes but with murdock because his virile hardness had attracted her she had looked upon the venture with some excitement it was to be a thrill and into marriage she had brought a magnificent body a well sexed nature and nothing at all of the giveand take attitude to her it was a physical sexual thing that and nothing more murdock had failed her there she knew that he looked with only partly concealed disdain upon her repeated demands and she hated him for it for the last month of their life together he had not slept with her and there was no other woman at the time well she tightened her lips and moved erect on the davenport let him squirm she was in no hurry she could be free of him soon enough if it became necessary meanwhile she found that her married status helped her with other men more attentive murdock knew he was losing his plea he had long since accepted his part in the fiasco he did not blame her for the failure he had never been quite sure who

could see the trees of the tank grove separate from the buildings lying this side of it it looked perfectly still there what if they were gone he began to run a few steps but he was too tired and hungry to do it long at last he reached the tracks and started up the near embankment the low cindery hill his misery rose into his mouth and he could not help the sore pity of his return to the scene of fright and torture sobbing blindly he stumbled over the tracks down the other side and into the grove clearing where he stood waiting for them to speak cried tom his face was rivered with dried dusty marks of weeping but he waved and grinned at danny oscar sat on the log fat was asleep against a tree over at the edge of the grove you re just in time said oscar your friend here has been lonesome he has been crying for you i ca nt see why i have nt done anything have i now he smiled narrowly at tom as if to influence him to agreement no you have nt oh i have nt eh said oscar you do nt call that anything well i ll give you something to remember no no wait yes it was something it was awful mister do nt do nt do nt tom whimpered on his breath and rubbed his left arm where it still hurt from oscar s twistings all give it to me danny opened his shirt and pulled forth the knotted handkerchief he held it out oscar took it it was silent and apprehensive while oscar opened the handkerchief and counted the money he actually had nt expected so much he frowned and spat to hide his satisfaction it was going to be fun with this money when they got to the next town he and fat only fat need nt have a dime of it the old sow belly he looked sharply up thinking to dismiss the boys now that they had served him but he thought and they could see his thought run back of his whitish narrow eyes the thick mouthed discussion he made silently with himself they drew together and watched with pinched and staring faces certain that new horrors were being planned he thought if i let them go they will get somebody after me and this money that kid stole this money they d find out on the night freight he looked up and said you think that s enough money do you well i ll show you different you re going to work for me when can we go when i m good and ready see and if either of you say a word any time about me or what you did today i ll come back and i ll kick the hell out of you here i ll take the both of you somewhere where nobody ever ll hear of you again and i ll show you what s what fat stirred and awoke a little and murmured that he d like to be allowed to sleep oscar swore obscenely at him then he set the boys busy washing his socks in the pool in the ditch where he had discovered them so long ago this morning he made them wash everything he had in his roll of possessions the them hold his clothes there to dry the smoke wavered and fanned into their faces and into their clothes as the dusk began to glimmer across the light their spirits fell sorely and they felt abandoned and lost fat awoke and added twigs and leaves to the fire and shivered toward the flame chilled in his shapeless soul he hummed a little tune he seemed to welcome evening and the firelight and sight of the children puttering at their woeful tasks oscar sat sprawled hugely against the log dreaming at the wild party he was going to have on his money when he got somewhere as his spirits rose he felt hot blooded and his face turned dark with flush and his pale eyes reddened and watered and he told over to himself what he would do when he got a woman again and what he had done in the past and what women had made known to him of himself and of how that knowledge of his power his hugeness his might was what he had and have proved to him over and over again else he dimly feel himself defeated a creature powerless and wild yai hee he suddenly yelled and stirred his rump and his great legs with lust he jumped up and picked the boys away from the fire where they were waving his two shirts he knocked their heads together and crushed their arms in his grasps then he saw fat leaning over to gather a few more fagots for the fire and he made a running skip and kicked him and tumbled him to the ground and now he was calmer a little appeased he came back and told the boys they were to be free after the night freight pulled out fat and i are taking freight tonight when we re gone we re gone you can go home then i ll be on my way the boys nodded and shivered they had very little to think about anything yes sir on my way and am town yai hee fat came into the firelight that now fluttered in the increasing dark he was silent and he was hurt but he made no protest he added his scrapings of bark and twig to the fire and sighed heavily sitting down a little away and alone the boys did nt stir until the relief engine that would take the night freight out came idling up the track and crossing the horizon in their vision where evening lingered in the lower sky and night already
the mental wreck you might think when he s sober oh yes he is frequently he can sell big machinery steam shovels and things and he does it well he would nt hold his job at all if he did nt produce so there you are unlimited opportunity a motive that to his inflamed mind could easily be enough to make him commit murder and on top of that proof that he was there at the time carrying a weapon what more could you possibly ask for a good i could ask for a great deal more the professor leaned back and placed the finger tips of his right hand firmly and precisely on the finger prints of his left and then he talked with just as much firmness and precision you re trying to make it far too simple my dear you leave too many things unanswered i grant you that this tale of spurrier s is most interesting and sheds light in some dark corners but it does nt give us a bit of proof on the identity of the murderer spurrier might have seen a dozen men with everything from automatics to sawed off blunderbusses in their hands but it would nt mean that there was nt a thirteenth man around somewhere who did the dirty work let s assume for a minute that it was barton on the stairs with a gun in his right hand which i do nt believe to be true then according to your theory he would have waited a floor before proceeding that right i suppose so said harriett then what then barton would have continued on to the seventh floor entered this office shot mr grayson dropped the gun to the floor walked out and gone about his affairs is that what you want me to believe yes what about it what makes it so hard to swallow it just wo nt do that s all well then let s have your version my dear girl i have no version all i say is that alexander barton is no more of a murderer than he is a prohibitionist barton was thoroughly tight that night matt said his men were almost knocked down by his breath when they found him later in his office now drunken men do nt stand with one foot in the air as spurrier said he saw they do nt stand no man alive whether drunk or sober ever holds a gun ready for action in his right hand if he s left handed spurrier seemed to be rather definite that it was the right hand and alexander barton is left handed or had nt you noticed how do you know he s left handed demanded harriett she was not going to forsake her brain child without a struggle i ll give you three guesses harry how would i know it how for instance can i tell that you are very pretty and brown haired and just tall enough to come up to the bottom of my ear which means i suppose said she that you have talked with barton if so why beat around the bush so and especially why get so personal wells shrugged and waved his hands expressively i like getting personal with you i hope you do nt mind it does things to me but seriously yes i have talked with barton at his home i thought he d be more at ease there than here as a matter of fact i ve talked with a good many people george clark for instance and mary janowski the charwoman and the policeman who was on duty around here that night and any number of others i ve pried and peered into the most intimate souls of various good citizens and what have i to show for it nothing not even one decent grade b slightly shopworn clue tough is nt it for a whole day s work then said harriett suddenly repentant you did nt desert the cause yesterday after all did you no harry i did nt did you think i had i i did nt know what to think mr wells the front name in case shortened to cliff by impertinent people do you think you could remember it or should i write it down for you do you have these attacks often only about once in a lifetime let s hear you say it we re getting too far from the reservation said harriett briskly let s turn back you said i was trying to make this case too simple why do you say that because it is nt simple at all harry consider these points why should mr grayson be killed so soon after changing his will is it a mere coincidence or is it something else what was he watching for the night he was killed it must have been something outside the building or he would nt have needed the opera glasses but it must also have been something fairly close or he would have needed stronger glasses who killed john blann was the murder of john or was it another coincidence maybe of course it was neither it may have been a necessity brought about by whatever blann happened to discover that night but then what did blann discover you see i m asking a good many questions do you think alexander barton could answer any of them do you still think he s a murderer as well as a drunkard harriett considered then no i do nt he he s not the man now you re being reasonable harry said wells filling and lighting his pipe thoughtfully then he said but i have another question for you this is one that worries me a good deal you will remember from grayson s manuscript that it worried mattingly for a while too but then he seems to have forgotten it the question is why was bond grayson
a half a piece it is nt that she said but it s so much nicer in the fifty cent seats high up in the stadium you mean way up there on those stone seats she nodded it s not as comfortable as the ones downstairs she said but they re not as uncomfortable as they look and it s really much more well sort of private but it does nt matter if you have these already why just a moment i said i took the tickets out of my pocket gutter oh she said you should nt why not i said remembering to kick myself i do nt like that kind of cheap flash no sense in sitting out in the open like an actor on a stage with the whole world staring at you i should ve had more sense than to buy those tickets anyway come on we ll get a couple of those other tickets there was quite a crowd going in when i stopped to buy two of the cheaper tickets it never occurred to me that there were that many people in the world who were willing to spend money to sit on stone steps and listen to music well and i guess it never occurred to me that i d be one of them either let s go over toward this end she said leading me toward the left we can climb up to the top row there and it wo nt down and toward the right you seem to know a lot about this place do nt you i said oh i come here pretty often she said alone i asked she blushed and i was sorry i d asked sometimes she said awkwardly sometimes with some other girls or some hold it a second i said i want to get a couple of these i bought two straw mats from a boy that was selling them and we continued to climb the wide cement steps you do nt really need them she said it s just as comfortablesitting on the stone i suppose i said but i could nt imagine her sitting on anything so hard and not hurting herself seriously this ought to be about right she said finally and i spread the mats on the cement step and we sat the right of us it was getting dark quickly but there was still enough light to see the tiers arranged like the rays from a flashlight and how crowded they were down below at the focus of the rays was the orchestra with the men tuning their instruments the sky was blue with a few stars beginning to show and a handful of clouds moving across it slowly i had nt looked at the sky for a month somehow you get out of the habit downtown it s nice is nt it she said i nodded and looked around at the people near us most of them were couples of about our own age they were sitting very close to one another and were whispering and holding hands and laughing for all the world as though they were alone up there and none of them paid any attention to the others i considered it a good sign they had sense just as the music started she turned to me suddenly you but i forgot in all the excitement about the tickets what was it you meant when you said to me on the phone before do nt ever say that or something like that it was pretty dark now and the only lights were down in the center of the stadium with the orchestra oh i guess i did nt mean anything i said let s just forget it that marked another first in my life for once i was afraid to say something to a dame but you must have she said looking at me i could tell by the way you said it all of a sudden well i ll tell you i said i do nt know if i can exactly tell you what i mean and then again i added maybe you wo nt like it so suppose we skip the whole thing please she said i d rather you told me it was the first time she d called me by my given name and the way she said it made the skin and the little hairs on the side of my jaw stand up and tingle well at least i could say she had better manners than babushkin well it s like this i said maybe i do nt know you long enough to go around telling you these things but hell the way i figure i figure it s important so do nt get sore or anything like that okay i promise she said smiling and i was sure she meant it all right i said now do nt ask me for explanations or anything like that because i ca nt give them to you all i know is there s something about you let s say about the way they put your you sit and walk and even talk i heard it on the phone to night there s something there that s sort of soft and well i guess honest is the best word anyway that s the general idea see and it reminds me a lot of my mother and any girl that can do that i mean remind me of my mother must be pretty good you follow me she nodded a little quickly without looking at me now i continued this is where it gets a little thick but it s the best i can do in the way of an explanation i mean if you only let yourself alone if you only act natural you can take my word for it you re all right you ca nt go wrong anything you say or do any
huh you ve gagged him that s the way it goes sometimes but to an explosive suggestion from brissenden the inspector objected not a chance look at his mouth he d wear out a squad he did wear out sherwood he did no more talking the attorney fired questions at him tried to browbeat him reasoned with him but cramer was right de roode had been gagged he said arrest me or said nothing not even bothering to shake his head finally the attorney told the trooper take him out and have one of the men keep him de roode you re being held as a material witness do nt let anybody talk to him send chisholm in brissenden watched them go and then growled be alive now and we would have got it out of him today i say that talbot ought to take that bird down to the barracks and work on him i want it on record that i say that okay sherwood gulped his cup of coffee now lukewarm i m not trying to make a record i m trying to stop this damn massacre he poured hot coffee and sipped at that he can take him later if it looks that way first let s see what we ve got what we have nt got is motive and we ca nt get a line on any why in the name of god would de roode want to murder p l storrs or foltz or even chisholm we have a motive for ranth but where would zimmerman fit into that and if de roode did hear zimmerman lock the door how did ranth get in the room if de roode did it himself why did he and why did he kill zimmerman and why the devil did he kill storrs and if the two jobs were done by different people who were they and why did they do it sherwood glared at dol what about it miss bonner how are the ideas coming you wanted to know why i sent for de roode because he heard zimmerman lock his door how do you like that but dol had no opportunity to tell how she liked it len chisholm came in from the standpoint of elegance he was a wreck dol looking at him thought they might at least have brushed some of the cigarette ashes off of him his tie was on one side his shirt needed tucking in and his face was either comic or heroic as it might move you with a desperate dignity he ignored the men and squinted at dol oh so there there you are meant it for a friendly question dol said nothing he frowned at her gave her up and turned to the men my god are you fellows still here he pointed an accusing finger not too steady at cramer who was in the chair maguire of bridgeport had occupied twelve hours before you ve been monkeying with your nose it s not the same nose at all o you know cyrano de bergerac let s hear you say it cyrano de bergerac he abruptly shifted to sherwood mind if i sit down cramer grunted in disgust you might as well ask questions of a weegie board is this the one your man found knocking on zimmerman s door yeah and the one who saw storrs asleep on the bench saturday afternoon huh he gets around cramer chewed on his cigar and watched len s elaborate performance of lowering himself into a he s good if you let him sleep it off he ll claim he ca nt remember anything if you duck him he ll have a fit sherwood stared at len look here chisholm do you know what your name is certainly len smiled at him indulgently do you how drunk are you well len s brow wrinkled i ll tell you i m too drunk to drive a car i ve got too much sense but i m not too drunk to know where i am i know exactly where i am that s fine sherwood sounded encouraging then you probably know where you ve been too for instance when you went to zimmerman s room what did you do in there len shook his head emphatically you must mean my room you re mixed up you must mean what did i mean zimmerman s room the one around the corner from yours in the other hall more than two hours ago you went there in the dark and knocked on the door remember and the trooper came up and spoke to you and you told him you thought it was miss bonner s room and before the trooper came you turned the knob of that door to open it that s why you ought to be able to remember whether the door was locked just concentrate on that was the door locked len looked cunning and superior he waved a hand i see what you re doing you re trying to get me top compromise miss bonner it s a fallacy if miss bonner s door was locked how would zimmerman get in he frowned that s not what i mean i mean how would i get in and i did nt get in that s why i say you must mean my room i sure you did but that door you were knocking on when you tried to open it was it locked len shook his head you do nt understand anything there would nt be any use trying to open a door if it was locked it would nt do you any good okay sherwood sighed he leaned forward and demanded abruptly what did you have against zimmerman why did you hate him hate who steve zimmerman oh him len nodded that runt why did you hate him i do nt know i never stop to think why when i hate anybody
washed their hands of the affair here and there was to be seen the wry grimace the sightless eye of a man who knew that in an instant he would be killed they went up slowly reached the height again dead yankees lay thick but others had sprung up to take their places the newcomers fired with ease and fury running down the slope the confederates doggedly sustained the fire and were pushing on when a battery was seen just moving into position where the ridge turned the arrogant gunners leaped from the still bouncing carriages slid to their places and began sending round after round of grape into the surging mass of besiegers men fell thickly those who were left turned and ran at top speed for the foot of the slope they passed the oak where they had been rallied for the second charge pushed pell mell through briar thickets and undergrowth to fall sobbing with exhaustion on the ground the captain was there leaning against a tree drawing rasping breaths as the men rolled apprehensive eyes toward him he jerked himself to his feet went forward to salute the colonel who just then galloped up those men who were lying near heard the colloquy between the two heard the young captain sob out disgustedly the colonel s order general hill says to hold this position and await fresh troops general deshler s heart were torn from his body by a shell that came ripping out of the woods at noon george rowan was with him when it happened the tenth texas arrived on the ground they were to occupy at ten o clock it was a wooded ridge two hundred yards from the yankee breastworks colonel mills had dismounted and was running alongside of his men when they came up to the crest semple s battery at the left of the ridge was still firing then mills swore savagely when he saw the gunners limber up and lash their horses to ride away they want us to hold it without artillery boys well we god damn will a shell bursting ten feet below threw up a black geyser that covered him from his men s sight he emerged wiping his face free of cinders and ordered the men to fall back a little and fire lying down then he went down the hill still swearing to see if he could get douglas battery up the was just within range of canister but the grape was the worst under it men dodged backward and forward like jack in the boxes or plastered themselves to the hill so tight that only the upward reaching of the arm told the living from the dead toward noon the texans supply of ammunition ran low george was lying behind a stump trying to pick off a yankee gunner when he felt a hand on his shoulder and mills told him to go find general deshler and tell him the ammunition was giving out george plunged down the hillside through a cloud of hot smoke just in time to see his little mare break her tether and go snorting off he cut a horse loose from a captured gun mounted and using part of a rope trace as his riding whip rode off in search of deshler the young brigadier was sitting his horse beside a clump of sumac bushes two of his staff officers were with him hearne was telling the general that the place was too exposed when the ridge as rowan was giving the message it was perhaps the sight of a man who suddenly fell sidewise from behind a stump spread eagling as he fell that decided him not to ask a staff officer to risk his life up there he had half turned to hearne when he shook his head and murmuring something george thought it was ca nt send that boy rode off at a gallop he went so fast that george on his winded horse had trouble in keeping up with him it was hotter now than it had been a few minutes ago and mills did not seem to be in the place where he had left him or was it that the place itself had changed with the black geysers springing up everywhere keeping the very ground under your feet in motion the fire and brimstone aunt charlotte s preacher talked so much about he thought and he dodged his horse desperately through the smoke trying not to lose sight of deshler deshler s big back was oak a few feet away george s horse danced and george swayed involuntarily far to the right when he came up deshler was out of the saddle and flat on the ground george looked down saw the red sponge that had been deshler s chest he got off his horse put his hands to his face and cried out it seemed a long time before men came running with stretchers mills was standing there as they carried deshler s body off he would not look his face was black as a fiend s with powder and he kept shouting to men who were so far up the hill that they could not hear him ammunition out get up and bay net em then rowan tethered his horse to a sapling and followed mills back into the fight the men were down to their last round now george ran about over the field gathering up cartridge boxes from the dead and wounded he had just taken a pistol from a dead yankee when and saw ned allard in a hand to hand struggle with a yankee george ran a few steps forward then stopped he passed a hand before his forehead to clear his sight ned s arm was locked around the yankee s body but above that arm george could see blue cloth he levelled the pistol barrel took careful aim the hammer clicked george threw the
the hold the hallorans had on mrs garr was other than blood perhaps that was why they came to her for money but the lectures had been very auntly she had nt sounded as if she were being blackmailed the others mr grant mr grant was the wallers mrs tewman they were all in their forties or early fifties they were all the right age it took me back to the beginning again they could all be suspected and again mr kistler seemed the least likely judging by the results i d had when i d thought that before i was probably due to find out he had been born in mrs garr s house or that mrs garr had ruined his father the problem of who had killed mrs garr had seemed fairly simple before a prowler caught in his prowling had been such an obvious explanation but how complicated this business of mrs garr s past made it now the possibilities were almost endless i d read enough detective stories to know it was always the least likely person who went in for murder that made mr kistler it well i did nt care if he was it a man who amused himself as mr kistler did a chaser a sleeper around and i d amusing that time he i quit smiling to bite into my thoughts again if mr kistler s story about friday night was true then he had an alibi for the time when mrs garr probably came back to the house but he was an extremely worthless character if his story was nt true then he must have had something to do with mrs garr s death hiding that ticket could nt mean much else it would also mean that for certain mrs garr had been murdered i could nt think of any way her railroad ticket could have come into mr kistler s possession if she had died a natural death if he had murdered her then his story about the girl was nt true just a faked up alibi made awful to sound more convincing and then i would nt have so much reason to think his character worthless he might have had a lovely motive such as revenging a sister i caught myself hoping he had murdered mrs garr decided i d give it up forever i gave up puzzling over mrs garr for the time being anyway i went to bed i was glad there was a policeman in the house just before i dropped asleep i opened one eye i d suddenly thought who the other officer must be and why he d ducked he did nt want me to see him i was being shadowed the telephone s ringing and mrs tewman in the hall yelling mr kistler mr kistler he do nt answer she shouted into the phone she added crossly after an interval all right i ll knock probably i thought sleepily i was the only person in the house who knew where mr kistler was unless the lean faced policeman was still on duty no mr kistler would not answer the knock on his door what did it matter who called him yes it might i realized it was up to me to be noble i wrapped my negligee around me in the yellow sunshine and went out into the hall sure enough the policeman who knew mr kistler s whereabouts was gone we had a new guard this one sat on the davenport because he probably could nt get into the chair he was a fat lump he did nt say a word he was just there staring with his round blue eyes we were having a wonderful opportunity to look over the gilling city police force mrs tewman upstairs was pounding on a door i picked up the dangling receiver hello this is mrs dacres i oh hello a young man s voice replied cordially i ve heard about you where s hodge who re you i m les trowbridge you know his partner the guide what s he doing celebrating the murder wildly in jail my god what s he want to get himself to there for on a day like this he does nt it was nt voluntary you mean he had the nerve to go out and get drunk and bust up the town last night oh no it was the murder now listen mrs dacres you ca nt tell me they ve pinched hodge for murder oh no they re just holding him for investigation or something because he had a ticket a memorial day excursion ticket to chicago that s the ticket mrs garr was going to use to go to chicago on but could nt find it was a little hard for mr kistler to explain oh for tripes sake where does he say he got it mr kistler s darling little story is that a girl gave it to him one of the girls you and he were out with a week say maybe she did say the girl i was with had one too they were passing em around the table they said say i ll bet that s where he did get it i m hearing you i said but for gosh sake he ca nt stay in jail loafing today does nt he know we ve got that advertising manager from the p x stores coming in today he s got him half sold on a big advertising contract and we need that dough sister how we need it he never goes down till noon anyway i pointed out say woman do you ever check on when he comes down wednesday and thursday mornings say sometimes he does nt have to come down he is here i did nt realize mr kistler went in so heavily for labor he d always spoken of his work as a joke but he would
at least at last cousin john raised his hand for silence it is the devout and burning wish of every patriot that this cruel emergency may pass he paused and surveyed the crowd amid whose silence a hoof on the cobblestones could have been heard a block away his mouth widened almost into a smile and he nodded his head slowly and repeatedly at last under the spell of the expert demagogue there was laughter in the pranks which was taken up by the crowd who suddenly broke into cheers again cousin john gestured half bowing for silence now my friends i come to the greatest pleasure of all i have the signal honor to present to you your neighbor kinsman and friend he will be known henceforth until the honor of further promotion as colonel montgomery corse commander of the seventeenth virginia there was more cheering as cousin john stepped back and colonel corse moved forward with a long sheet of paper in his hand he stood calm and firmly on his head he raised the paper and began to read i turned my back on the platform the better to manage the horses looking between them i saw in the crowd back against the wall of the corner house the impassive face of brother george surveying the scene that our first allegiance is due to virginia that we will obey her commands and abide by her fortunes that in her defense against all assailants whatsoever we are ready to risk life and all that renders life desirable to this we pledge the faith of soldiers and the sacred affection of sons the silence in which the crowd had received the colonel s speech continued when it broke i was brought sharply out of the superior reality that george s face had created for me i had heard again his anguish in the shadowy back parlor they think of nothing but marriage and death and the honor of virginia you will understand of course that the honor of virginia meant something to me yet words that would ordinarily have moved me as it had moved the crowd to shouts and tears had been far away and i knew what it was to be apart from the emotions that all men shared i suppose i came nearer there in the street holding his mare to seeing the world through george posey s eyes than i had ever come before before the cheering began i fancied i had caught his eye and a gleam of this communion flashed to me before i knew it the officers were taking their horses from me cousin john flushed with his exertion said lead her down to the marshall house george ll get her there when i turned round to start the fierce yells struck me the crowd and the soldiers had melted as i slowly made way for the big mare in the direction of king street when i came to the marshall house the crowd was thinning away i tied queen susie at the hitching rack around on the where i expected to find brother george he was nowhere to be seen i hesitated before i could decide to enter i had been forbidden to go into taverns but i remembered it was sunday the bar would be closed and i had a definite mission gadsby s i think was considered a more genteel place but one of the early gadsbys had been a speculator that is a negro trader and papa was dead set against the very name mr jackson the proprietor of the marshall house was an excellent man i walked through the front door into the dim little office there were some strange men leaning upon the desk behind which on the wall was a rack upon which a few keys hung from wooden pegs against the opposite wall stood a row of big unpainted chairs flanked at each end by large hr ass cuspidors most of the chairs were occupied by men silently smoking cigars i walked up to the desk said mr jackson gave me a polite glance followed by recognition lacy what can i do for you i waited for the rest of what he would surely say but got instead only an urbane stare i am looking for mr posey sir i expect he ll be in here in a minute he turned away but he too had felt his omission and he looked at me again he had a strong shrewd face partly concealed by a wide black mustache son he said i hope that your father is well he paused i have nt seen him all this past week i feel that people are entitled to differences of opinion he said it coldly and turned again to the men by god he said in a loud voice if yankee soldiers enter this town they ll be greeted by two four pounders from my back yard i ve got em in one of the chairs quickly folded his newspaper and walked out of the hotel all eyes followed him too hot for him one of the strange men said i heard footsteps descending the stairs in the back of the room it was george he smiled at me without speaking walked to the desk and laid a key upon it five dollars sir said mr jackson george took five silver dollars out of his trousers pocket and stacked them neatly upon the desk he had evidently been in alexandria for nearly a week but he had not come near us what had he been doing he came to me at the end of the desk semmes wants you to go over and visit us in georgetown lacy he said i said nothing your pa sent him a message i was bewildered school ai nt over yet brother george i said the front door opened john entered there was no greeting except that george nodded to
this it would worry her dreadfully if i m late she ll wonder she might ask where i ve been i ll call you in the morning from the office i mean wiping her eyes cicily had smiled at this novice in deception who was her grey haired father as a matter of fact she had wanted him to go albert at that moment might be walking up from the station if he found them together like mumsy he d wonder and her father s discretion might be strained to the breaking point their future relations if they were to seem amicable depended on the assumption that the latter was left alone she remembered that bertie had seen his grandfather she must tell him not to mention it she found him eating his cereal and his apple sauce in the pantry for he still had supper early spread on a tray under cover of the whirr of vesta s eggbeater in the kitchen she whispered conspiratorially it s a secret from daddy a surprise you must nt tell him the innocent faith of her little accomplice pricked cicily s conscience like christmas he suggested his dark eyes dancing it seemed shameful and sordid to make use of a child she walked back into the living room thinking how little her own deceit troubled her and remembering the days when a thought concealed from albert had seemed a major disloyalty presently she heard his latchkey in the door cicily he called as soon as he d opened it i m here in the living room she wondered if he d notice the traces of her entered the room not yet she said falsely then as his face fell has anything happened oh no not at all fox is drawing up the papers he moved a little nearer why sweet have you been crying denial would be absurd so she took refuge in severity i have plenty to cry about he gazed at her helplessly across the gulf of their estrangement why do you torment yourself how she asked harshly he shrugged and turned away from her unwilling apparently to be led into a quarrel he sat down in the armchair and opened the evening paper its pages crackled in the silence before he answered her question very unnecessarily by tormenting me before noon the next day her father called her on the telephone i ve talked with fox he said briefly and wired to alden he ll send you the money in fact said cicily with equal brevity she hoped that her father would tell her no more his words had implied that fox had been convincing but she did nt want to know if he d mentioned harold doty you re sure you do nt want me to have a word with albert he asked very briskly avoiding emotion i d like to he added oh no dad please very well he accepted it how are you feeling much better really did mumsy suspect anything i think that she knew i had something on my mind about me i do nt think so we ll keep her in darkness stygian said cicily thanks a lot dad good bye the very next morning before breakfast was over the check arrived from uncle alden air mail special delivery accompanied by a letter expressing shocked disapproval cicily endorsed it before albert left of green paper with her name and her husband s written on the back of it in her small square handwriting could avert disaster she had to force herself to realize that it signified a transference of property of very considerable value as she handed it to albert she had no sense of loss but he in accepting it seemed to realize everything the humblest gratitude shone in his eyes do nt make a speech said cicily hastily and then they both laughed i t was very assuaging to laugh again with albert cicily immediately felt more at ease that laughter marked a moment when fit seemed quite possible that they might achieve a relationship that was friendly and affectionate and nothing more disturbing and even maintain it albert did nothing to shatter this illusion he seemed ready at last to accept her as a friend a friend and a partner to be kept scrupulously informed of the events that followed that very evening he and reported his departure for his native waukesha he had brought home a check for three thousand dollars and ventured a smile as he said here s your change what about fox s bill cicily asked anxiously i ll settle that myself he was eager to assure her it s not very large finally one evening when the children were busy with their home work in the dining room and cicily sat by the living room fire ivy left for new york today he informed her casually she could not help asking did you see her off no i had lunch with her he volunteered calmly again she faced the fact that albert had once emphasized the truth could be unpleasant she asked was that necessary her voice a trifle sharp he answered it was kind she could not deny that a man owed his former mistress the courtesy of kindness but she resented this glimpse of ivy at a little restaurant table and imagined their talk coloured by the intimacies that had existed between them she felt an aversion profound and instinctive to all irregular relationships a horror of the persistence of the memories that must follow them i m glad you were kind she said somewhat stiffly and very untruthfully then suddenly anguish welled up within her and after a moment of painful irresolution she asked albert does she still love you with pitiful intensity the question surprised and a little embarrassed him well he said awkwardly not as she did the implication that she had and with passion shook cicily almost as if
realised that frith will have taken them to the morning room she said it must be getting on for half past twelve you know your way now do nt you yes mrs danvers i said and i went down the big stairway into the hall knowing she was standing there above me her eyes watching me i knew i must go back now to the morning room and meet maxim s sister and her husband i could not hide in my bedroom now over my daphne du maurier shoulder and i saw mrs danvers still standing there at the head of the stairs like a black sentinel i stood for a moment outside the morning room with my hand on the door listening to the hum of voices maxim had returned then while i had been upstairs bringing his agent with him i supposed for it sounded to me as if the room was full of people i was aware of the same feeling of sick uncertainty i had experienced so often as a child when summoned to shake hands with visitors and turning the handle of the door i blundered in to be met at once it seemed with a sea of faces and a general silence here she is at last said maxim where have you been hiding we were thinking of sending out a search party here is beatrice and this is giles and this is frank crawley look out you nearly trod on the dog handsome very much like maxim about the eyes and jaw but not as smart as i had expected much tweedier the sort of person who would nurse dogs through distemper know about horses shoot well she did not kiss me she shook hands very firmly looking me straight in the eyes and then she turned to maxim quite different from what i expected does nt answer to your description at all everyone laughed and i joined in not quite certain if the laugh was against me or not wondering secretly what it was she had expected and what had been maxim s description and this is giles said maxim prodding my arm and giles stretched out an enormous paw and wrung my hand squeezing the fingers limp genial eyes smiling from behind horn rimmed glasses frank crawley said maxim and i turned to the agent a colourless rather thin man with a prominent adam s apple in i wondered why but i had no time to think of that because frith had come in and was offering me sherry and beatrice was talking to me again maxim tells me you only got back last night i had not realised that or of course we would never have thrust ourselves upon you so soon well what do you think of manderley i ve scarcely seen anything of it yet i answered it s beautiful of course she was looking me up and down as i had expected but in a direct straightforward fashion not maliciously like mrs danvers not with unfriendliness she had a right to judge me she was rebecca maxim s sister and maxim himself came to my side now putting his arm through mine giving me confidence you re looking better old man she said to him her head on one side considering him you ve lost ve got you to thank for that nodding at me i m always very fit said maxim shortly never had anything wrong with me in my life you imagine everyone ill who does nt look as fat as giles bosh said beatrice you know perfectly well you were a perfect wreck six months ago gave me the fright of my life when i came and saw you i thought you were in for a breakdown giles bear me out did nt maxim look perfectly ghastly last time we came over and did nt i say he was heading for a breakdown well i must say old chap you re looking a different person said giles very good thing you went away does nt he look well crawley i could tell by the tightening of maxim s muscles under my arm that he was trying to keep his temper for some reason this talk about even and i thought it tactless of beatrice to harp upon it in this way making so big a point of it maxim s very sunburnt i said shyly it hides a multitude of sins you should have seen him in venice having breakfast on the balcony trying to get brown on purpose he thinks it makes him better looking everyone laughed and mr crawley said it must have been wonderful in venice mrs de winter this time of the year and yes i said we had really wonderful weather only one bad day was nt it maxim the conversation drawing away happily from his health and so to italy safest of subjects and the blessed topic of fine weather conversation was easy now no longer an effort maxim and giles and beatrice were discussing the running of maxim s car and mr crawley was asking if it was true there were no more do nt think he would have cared at all had there been steamers at anchor in the grand canal he was saying this to help me it was his contribution to the little effort of steering the talk away from maxim s health and i was grateful to him feeling him an ally for all his dull appearance jasper wants exercise said beatrice stirring the dog with her daphne du maurier foot he s getting much too fat and he s barely two years old what do you feed him on maxim my dear beatrice he has exactly the same routine as your dogs said maxim do nt show off and make out you know more about animals than i do dear old boy how can you pretend to know what jasper has been
and tell of time knowing that he still loved her as he had loved nothing on earth but mary a perfect child it seemed to him then that he spoke because he could no longer help it miss lettie he heard himself saying as he rose and stood beside her i would be proud and honored to have you marry me it was out at last over her head william s face loomed startled into immobility do you know what you are saying philip he demanded sharply i m asking her to marry me william philip responded quietly just what you heard me say letitia took no notice of their conversation if she heard it it seemed to make no impression on her jumping jehosophat exploded william glaring at his cousin and falling back on an expletive that he was apt to use under stress you ve had two wives already he blurted out the truth stung to a biting fury that knew no pity very true answered philip refusing to lose his temper too true but need that matter to her he inquired reasonably she is not in love with rte ant in love with her he explained it s the truth william he added meeting his cousin s incredulous gaze letitia stirred against william s shoulder and raising her face she looked straight at philip he said that he thought he had loved her once he would nt deny it he said that would be like denying he loved me now she was silent but they could see she was repeating his words to herself that she had not finished what she had to say suddenly she moved over to philip and standing straight and still in front of him with her hands clasped tightly together and tell of time replied to the proposal that he you tomorrow she told philip in a clear dead voice and turning went rapidly into the house william sat down abruptly and studied philip s face you must be crazy he said gazing intently at his cousin entirely crazy but i believe you are telling the truth i never knew you to do otherwise he admitted he was puzzled and irritable as people and ants become when they do not know how to get around obstacles suddenly set up in the path they wish to follow philip stood with his hand on one of the posts supporting the steep overhanging balcony he could just catch the murmur of the river flowing over the twisted cypress roots that deflected its current and caused it ever so often even to shift its bed he felt old remote and suddenly extremely weary yet he was more at peace than he had been for many a day the die was cast at any rate that his desires would necessarily determine the outcome such a state of mind would have been impossible for povey a younger man to summon of course william went on firmly she did nt mean it and if she did i would nt expect you to take advantage of her excitement she s upset now she ll think differently in the morning he stood up deeply perturbed by the turn his plans had taken go on home philip he said studying his cousin s face we are all tired and worked up this ca nt he settled tonight you ll see how foolish the whole thing is in the morning go to bed that s best if you stay were both apt to say something we ll regret later on without moving philip answered ii is back was still to william and he spoke almost as if he were dreaming his words and tell of timedropping from his lips william i d better go home he assented they ll both think better of it overnight i expect povey ll be over before daybreak he smiled a slow reminiscent smile then he swung around abruptly facing his cousin with an expression that william recognized in their boyhood when he had noticed philip s eyes narrow and harden as t hey now did he had learned there was never any use arguing further listen and mark what i say though william if she is willing to stand by what she said nothing on god s earth can prevent me from marrying her suddenly he put out his hand and shook william s spur frame vigorously it s absurd of course it s absurd i know it we re both a couple of doddering old idiots they ll be certain to make it up tomorrow good night i ll take your advice and go to bed william sighed in relief almost he said urgently go while you re talking sense philip mounted his horse and rode homeward when had he felt such lethargy and utter fatigue as now overtook him such dead and desperate certainty that there was no longer any use either to hope or to grieve as he was drifting off to sleep he remembered twice in his life when he had felt like this the day mary died and the clay he heard general lee had surrendered he did not open his eyes until the sun was well up in the sky his servant matt was standing by his bed touching him lightly dar s a young lady outside suh he was saying apologetically she tell me she hatter see you right straight away and cai nt wait philip was instantly awake he reached out for the cup of and tell of time black coffee in matt s other hand thinking at once that some of his patients had taken a saucer to cool he hastily drew on his clothes it s probably the miller child he decided lockjaw too i m afraid i suspected it yesterday he lifted his saddlebags where bottles neatly labelled in latin rested in small leather pockets then picking up his surgical case he checked over its contents
back towards the library windows the alarm seemed to have gone up inside the house and this time what did i see i saw this distinguished venerable gentleman again his curt nod indicated murray carefully juggling two thumbographs guiltily putting one in his pocket and hastily putting the other on the table murray had been listening with critical interest so so he observed with an almost teutonic inflection you thought i was working against you as usual you understate the case returned gore his face darkened so i did not care to tell where i had been i reserved the knowledge of what i had seen for a shot in the locker in case dirty work had been attempted have you anything more to add to that no inspector i think not the rest of what i said was true but may i ask who saw me knowles was standing at the window of the green room said elliot and the other began to whistle through his teeth then elliot s gaze moved from gore to murray to welkyn has any of you ever seen this before from his pocket he took a smaller section of newspaper in which the stained clasp knife had been carefully wrapped he opened it and exhibited the knife the expressions of gore and welkyn showed a general blankness but murray sucked in his bearded cheeks he where did you find this murray asked briskly near the scene of the crime do you recognize it h m you have tested it for fingerprints no ah a pity said murray growing brisker and brisker will you allow me to touch it if i handle it with the greatest circumspection correct me if i am wrong but did nt you young johnny he glanced at gore use to have a knife exactly like this did nt i present it to you in fact did nt you carry it for years i certainly did i always carry a pocket knife admitted gore reaching into his pocket and producing an old knife only slightly smaller and lighter than the one before them but for once interposed welkyn slapping his hand on the table for once and all i must insist on exercising the rights with which you sir absurd and improper and as your legal adviser i must tell you to disregard them such knives are as common as blackberries i once had one myself but what is wrong with the question asked gore puzzled i owned a knife like that it went with the rest of my clothes and effects in the titanic but it seems absurd to suppose that the one there could be before anybody could stop him murray had whipped a handkerchief out of his pocket moistened it at his lips a handkerchief in the mouth is one of the things which always set page s teeth on edge and wiped clean a small section of the blade about halfway down into the cleared steel had been roughly cut letters forming the word madeline it is yours johnny said murray comfortably you put this name there one day when i took you through the stonecutting works at ilford madeline repeated gore opening out his cigar into the sodden trees but page saw his face reflected momentarily in the gloomy glass it was a curious set indecipherable face unlike the one of mockery with which gore usually pointed out the difference between his moods and the world s he turned back but what about the knife are you suggesting that that poor tortured would be honest crook kept it about him all these years and finally cut his throat with it by the pool you seem to have determined that this is a case of murder and yet and yet he beat the flat of his hand slowly on his knee i ll tell you what it is gentlemen said elliot it s an absolutely impossible crime he detailed to them knowles s story the interest exhibited by both gore and murray was in contrast to the evident disgust and bewilderment of welkyn when elliot described the finding of the knife there was an uneasy movement through the group gore reflectively he looked at murray magister this is a matter after your own heart i do nt seem to know you perhaps we have grown too far apart but in the old days you would have hopped round the inspector full of strange theories and bearded like the pard i am no longer a fool johnny still let us hear a theory any theory so far you are the only one who has been reticent about the whole affair i second that motion observed dr fell murray settled himself more comfortably and began to wag his finger the exercise of pure logic he began is often comparable to working out immense sums in arithmetic and finding at the end that we have somewhere forgotten to carry one or multiply by two every one of a thousand figures and factors may be correct except that one but the difference in the answer to the sum may be pure logic i make a suggestion you know inspector that the coroner s inquest is almost certainly going to call this suicide ca nt say that sir not necessarily declared elliot a thumbograph was stolen and then returned a girl was nearly frightened to death you know as well as i do said murray opening his eyes what verdict a coroner s jury will return it is remotely possible that the victim might have killed himself and flung the knife away it is impossible that he should have been murdered but i assume that it is murder heh said dr fell rubbing his hands heh heh heh and the suggestion assuming that it is murder said murray i suggest that the victim was not in fact killed with the knife you have there i suggest that the marks on his

mouth hung loose the cigarette balanced on his lower lip you think you re smart and you re so goddamned dumb i told him even if you do nt dance off up in quentin you have such a bleak long lonely time ahead of you his cigarette jerked and dropped ash on his vest i said take the air he growled suddenly dust i got enough chinning with you beat it okey i stood up and went over to the tall oak desk and took his two guns out of my pockets laid them side by side on the blotter so that the barrels were exactly parallel i reached my hat off the floor beside the davenport and started for the door brody yelped hey i turned and waited his cigarette was jiggling like a doll on a coiled spring everything s smooth ai nt it he asked why sure this is a free country you do nt have to stay out of jail if you do nt want to that is if you re a citizen are you a citizen he just stared at me jiggling the cigarette the blonde agnes turned her head slowly and stared at me along the same level their doubt and frustrated anger agnes reached her silvery nails up abruptly and yanked a hair out of her head and broke it between her fingers with a bitter jerk brody said tightly you re not going to any cops in other not if it s the sternwoods you re working for i ve got too much stuff on that family you got your pictures and you got your hush go and peddle your papers make your mind up i said you told me to dust i was on my way out you hollered at me and i stopped and now i m on my way out again is that what you want you ai nt got anything on me brody said just a couple of murders small change in your circle he did nt jump more than an inch but it looked like a foot the white cornea showed all around the tobacco colored iris of his eyes the in the lamplight blonde agnes let out a low animal wail and buried her head in a cushion on the end of the davenport i stood there and admired the long line of her thighs brody moistened his lips slowly and said sit down pal maybe i have a little more for you what s that crack about two murders mean i leaned against the door where were you last night about seven thirty joe his mouth drooped sulkily and he stared down at the floor i was watching a guy a guy who had a nice racket i figured he needed a partner in geiger i was watching him now and then to see had he any tough connections i figure he has friends or he do nt work the racket as open as he does but they do nt go to his house only dames you did nt watch hard enough i said go on i m s raining hard and i m buttoned up in my coupe and i do nt see anything there s a car in front of geiger s and another car a little way up the hill that s why i stay down below there s a big buick parked down where i am and after a while i go over and take a gander into it it s registered to vivian pregan nothing happens so i scram that s all i le waved his cigarette his eyes crawled up and down my face could be i said know where that buick is now why would i in the sheriff s garage it was lifted out of twelve feet of water off lido fish pier this a m there was a dead man in it he had been sapped and the car pointed out the pier and the hand throttle pulled down brody was breathing hard one of his feet tapped restlessly jesus guy you ca nt why not this buick was down back of geiger s according to you well mrs regan did nt have it out her chauffeur a lad named owen taylor had it out he went over to geiger s place to have words with him because owen taylor was sweet on carmen and he did nt like the kind of games geiger was playing with her he let himself in the back way with a jimmy and a gun and he caught geiger taking a photo of carmen without any clothes on so his gun went off as guns will and geiger fell down dead and owen ran away but not without the photo negative geiger had just taken so you ran after him and took the photo from him how else would you have got hold of it brody licked his lips yeah he said but that do nt make me knock him off sure i heard the shots and saw this killer come slamming down took out after him he hit the bottom of the canyon and went west on sunset beyond beverly hills he skidded off the road and had to stop and i came up and played copper he had a gun but his nerve was bad and i sapped him down so i went through his clothes and found out who he was and i lifted the plateholder just out of curiosity i was wondering what it was all about and getting my neck wet when he came out of it all of a sudden and knocked me off the car he was out of sight when i picked myself up that s the last i saw of him how did you know it was geiger he shot i asked gruffly brody shrugged i figure it was but i can be wrong when i had the plate developed and
he stood there lost in his own thoughts absentmindedly pulling his greatcoat around his throat the tight composure he held on himself fell away he was a cruelly driven man he moved toward the door and st george spoke to him quietly at once the restraint drew his face together like a mask fitted on oh good evening st george i ve been trying to get some information about these accursed trains so i can bring my wife and son back from the valley i think we re going to have some action up there from this man jackson when the weather breaks and my wife s family are in a danger zone but i ca nt get a thing out of the virginia central i suppose you were down watching them bring in young wise st george nodded a dreadful thing jennings wise was a fine boy a very promising one and i do nt mean only as an officer he was one of the best newspaper editors we had in the state did you know his father no but he was in the office before he took his men to roanoke island begging benjamin for reinforcements benjamin talked and said nothing as usual very suave and diplomatic about it all and went back to his madeira and havanas while the blues were wiped out it was all a very bad business terrible terrible there was a pause can i offer you a lift in my carriage virginius asked abruptly thank you virginius i had intended walking with the escort but i m chilled to the bone st george passed through the door which virginius kirby at the carriage virginius hesitated then said would you care to come to my home and have a nightcap with me i have one bottle left of excellent old marquis de pombal and you ve never been in my home you know st george understood at a glance that the man wanted companionship i should be delighted virginius they sank back in the cushions and virginius pulled about them a thick laprobe yes it was a terrible business virginius went on as though there had been no interruption roanoke island opens the way to norfolk and it could have been held i ve never regarded ex governor wise highly as a military man but apparently the blues and the other troops did all that was humanly possible i ca nt understand why benjamin did nothing what can he do it s not the war department it s the administration davis is running everything and according to him and his ideals re defending our rights i used to complain about the way remminger ran the treasury department but it s no use he s just a rubber stamp for the president like benjamin and all the others the place where benjamin would be really useful is the diplomatic service he has that type of brain he s shrewd patient and devious he s too devious for our good i do nt trust him no virginius i think he s honest and he would have been a far better man to send to england than mason if davis were shrewd he would ve sent benjamin to europe while the yankees had mason and slidell in prison that s when we had england s sympathy do nt you think we have it now they re debating recognizing us and they ll keep on debating until they see which side wins the united states has backed down and england has saved interests and only that but good god they ve got to have cotton that s what everybody thinks st george snorted do nt you think england would rather have a few mills shut for a while than to make an enemy of the united states they re giving it a long view if they gave it a long enough view they d see that would risk their textile markets they re not seeing it that long virginius lord john russell wants to make a good showing for queen victoria while he s alive textile markets will be something for other generations to worry about no we lost our chance with cotton when we did nt borrow their gold with cotton security it s too late now with the blockade tightening the way it is damn that blockade dumping ships full of rocks in charleston harbor are we to go on forever making speeches about our our commerce and overruns our country the way they re winning in the west all of tennessee and kentucky will soon be open to the scoundrels anyway we probably have a new war secretary now public clamor will force benjamin to resign that does nt get us back all the months we ve lost proving to the world that we re nonaggressors while they plan another on to richmond as soon as spring comes no and it does nt get us back roanoke island and the men we lost there i met a young man in the blues on secession night who i understand was wounded and captured there leatherbury his name was you know him leatherbury oh yes i ve heard of him very curious st george waited the carriage drew to a stop at the curb well here we are virginius offered st george the street a flagstone court in front enclosed by a tall iron railed fence marble blocks on either side of the stone steps projected almost to the gate a low light burned in the hallway and st george noticed that the brass on the white door needed attention inside the house was not too warm and virginius hurried into the library talking nervously i ve had to let my butler and housemaid go the groom doubles in brass on special occasions but i ca nt bother him after a night like this the cook poor soul is worn out by taking care of the whole
with large dark eyes that now gazed at him worshipfully eliza was a servant girl who had migrated from england when she saw brigham in nauvoo she fell in love with him she had read in the old testament that persons sometimes served seven years for what they wanted whereupon she had gone to brigham s mary ann angel known to everyone as mother young and asked if she could serve seven years in her house and then become one of brigham s wives how eliza had learned that plural marriage existed in nauvoo brigham did not know if she wanted to serve by all means to do so and here she was humbly gazing at him and with five years of servitude ahead of her what he said did you come for i want to be near you even if you starve to death yes brother brigham well you probably will after inspecting the company that had moved in he summoned porter go to nauvoo and fetch the mail tell the rest of the saints to stay there until i order them to come tell dan wells that is my command and i want no more damned foolishness tell him we re all freezing and starving to death out here i ll tell him and make him understand that i mean it i will but you know dan wells is pigheaded it was not the pigheadedness of dan wells the saints in nauvoo felt deserted few belongings into anything they could find on wheels and were setting out desperately to overtake brigham porter said the road from nauvoo to brigham s camp was lined with them company by company they were pushing forward through the rain and the mud when he learned that fifteen thousand of his people were on the way to overtake him or soon would be brigham was speechless anger was his first emotion but after a few minutes porter saw in brigham s eyes something that was like a mist of tears then suddenly and still without having said a word brigham turned away he realized now what a stupendous task he had on his hands pit was the measure of the man that he did not flinch on the contrary he moved with twice his customary vigor realizing that he must push forward at once before the oncoming horde could overtake his camp for four days with superhuman effort he went ahead but on chariton river he was again forced to halt that the teams floundered and sank and some of the smaller carts all but disappeared streams were so dangerous that when fording was attempted several of the beasts were drowned for a week brigham remained on the bank of the chariton thinking of his problems and wondering how many bridges he would have to build he wanted a water route but the reports of lewis and clark and others declared there was none after a week he had a bridge across the chariton and pushed forward to locust river and stopped again provisionswere low every person in camp looked emaciated some were too weakened for labor knowing that his whole camp would die of famine if he did not act quickly he sent scouts in all directions and porter returned with good news thirty miles westward he said there was fertile land adjacent to a beautiful campsite this the camp reached after wallowing in mudholes for another week for two months it had been on the road and was still less than clayton solemnly observed in his journal made an average of two and one half miles a day to brigham he said we ll be ten years reaching the rocky mountains and he gazed at the fine cloth of his trousers which water and mud had ruined how long was abraham on the road not ten years i hope cheer up brother william we ll be there in five clayton gazed toward nauvoo where his favorite wife was soon to have a child five years he said you do nt mean it i mean said brigham we ll get there if it takes us forever the new site was so beautiful that the saints called it garden grove on all sides grassy and flowered hills rolled away in thousands of untilled acres right here brigham said they would plow the sod and plant crops and within a week the area had been transformed eight miles and everywhere ox teams drew plows through the rich earth while other teams dragged harrows behind men who sowed seed from their hands five thousand exiles were converted into an agricultural camp while hundreds planted others gathered and hewed timbers and built storehouses and some chosen for their skill with rifles went out daily to hunt wild game women repaired garments nursed the sick and cooked the meals and children scattered in search of edible roots and wild fruits one man set up a shop to mend shoes another a forge and blacksmith shop and a third tanned deer hides and made moccasins and gloves no one except the sick was idle if a man did not work brigham said he would not eat and his word was absolute law almost daily he sat as counselor and judge to hear tales of theft of ill will of petty woes one of the brothers said parley had challenged another to a duel for what a quarrel he wants vengeance nobody fights duels in this camp send him here the challenger came sulking and obstinate with the light of murder in his eyes what in hell demanded brigham are you up to ca nt you mind your own damned business i do but no man can call me a lousy bastard and live brigham gazed at the man he was hulking and evil tempered and had an old scar above his left eye no man in this camp can challenge another to a duel you go at once
recommended the i avies tavern six miles out of williamsburg as a small quiet place where he could likely have a good sleep and he started late in the morning of the third day with this as his objective but when he pulled up before the door at the end of an afternoon of snow that had changed to sleet and later settled to a drizzle of rain his satisfaction oozed away with the cold drip from his hat a drove of cattle stamped and lowed in a paddock behind the house and when he entered the small taproom seemed full of men with cow dung on their feet its acrid odor mingled with the stench of sweat and of wet wool coats smote him in the face he would have gone out gain for all the lateness of the hour if the host had not pushed through between the tables lean freckled face we have a crowd in here sure enough sir he said in answer to the expression in matthew s eyes but above i have a room with a good bed and a fire laid that old jim can light in jig time sir i f the young gentleman will follow me your supper can be brought up there sir it s a bad night sir he went on as matthew hesitated and there s no other inn between here and the city i ll have a chicken for you if you say the word sir matthew grinned for the man was oddly importunate as if it really mattered to him even with a full house whether one guest ent or stayed i ll certainly say the word then whatever it may be i have a gorse outside can you look after him too yes sir i can sure enough gro leaning against a corner of the bar light the fire upstairs r the young gentleman and then take care of his horse the tree of liberty the negro with a tug at a grizzled forelock started at once up the stairs at the back of the room and matthew followed in the wake of the freckled man who wedged a passage for him between the chairs above a little hallway ended in an open door through which came a flickering light the freckled man led the way inside a room of fair size which evidently ran the width of the house matthew stared at a large white blur and made out a bed curtained against the drafts beyond it was the dark shadow of a chest of drawers and at the far end the pallid outline of a fan window here on the right old jim knelt on the hearth encouraging a tiny flame in a cavern of a fireplace with a pair of bellows the freckled faced man bustled about lighting candles his apron still with his air of serving a potentate you have it all to yourself up here sir mrs davies and i have our rooms over the kitchen you ll find the drovers leave at daylight and if you just draw the curtains sir you ought to get a good nap of sleep after they leave from the look of your bed i have it in mind i might sleep the clock around matthew asserted you are mr davies humphrey davies sir and very much at your service odd the way the fellow kept bowing and smiling if he went on much longer matthew would feel out of place in spite of his green coat and silver buttons a clatter and splash of horses hoofs outside and the sound of a door below being thrown violently open caught their ears and set davies to bowing again if there s nothing more sir davies coming sir called the innkeeper and with a final bow he was gone turning to the fireplace matthew found the negro had vanished as well and without instructions for ranger s care he caught up the cloak he had laid aside and groped his way along the passage to the stairs he would see to his horse himself halfway down the stair he paused for three strangers and davies effectually blocked the foot as matthew arrived one of the strangers pushed aside three mugs to make a place for himself and sat down on the edge of a table to matthew s astonishment instead of roughly hustling him off his perch the three drovers rescued their drinks from overturning without comment and crowded together uncomfortably to give the stranger room talk in the inn had ceased and all the men were staring at the newcomers but there was no hint of resentment in the stare the firelight fell full on the man seated on the edge of the divergent roots table touching the indolent grace the pride in the thin face the high bridged nose and fine dark eyes under arched brows that lifted at the corners the man looked like an eagle matthew thought his smile as he spoke was charming firefly went lame four miles back davies and we ve been limping along for an hour keeping up our spirits with thoughts of your room upstairs the innkeeper s face was a profile of sympathetic regret as matthew could see i m sorry sir but it will do very well for one night davies i ve sent xenophon to elm hill for another mount and he ll be back by morning if you ca nt bear the thought of three of us in that bed of yours make up a pallet on the settle man only clear the stairway for god s sake and let us get out of this filthy atmosphere he rose from the table and with a shock matthew realized he was he managed clumsily humphrey davies was bowing protestingly i m sorry sir indeed i am it s not the bed sir but matthew descended the stair to lay a hand on the
paris that if they came back to juan would have to know the arts of love if only to protect himself there were dangerous kinds of women who could wreck the happiness of a man old or young and care not a flip of the fan about it one should know how to tell the good ones from the bad and generally alas it was not possible until it was too late there was another purpose too beauty was defending herself and marcel and harry or rather what she had done to harry perhaps her conscience troubled her for she talked often about the plate glass man and what might be happening to him in pittsburgh love was bewildering and many times you would nt be happy if you did and would nt be if you did nt you might make a resolve to go off by yourself and have nothing more to do with love but men had refused to let beauty do it and some day soon women would be refusing to let lanny do it soldier diplomat and man of the world who had written under the pen name of stendhal and who would tell them how love had fared in the midst of the last world war just a hundred years earlier not so long go in europe s long story there came post cards from marcel detaze he was well busy and happy to know they were safe at home he was not permitted to say where he was but gave the number of his regiment and battalion the censoring of mail was strict but no censor in france would object to a painter s declaring that he loved his beautiful blond mistress or to her replying that the sentiments were reciprocated beauty fed her soul upon these messages plus robbie s assurance that the war could nt last more than three or four month maybe marcel was nt going to see any fighting he would come home with a story of interesting adventure and life would begin again where it had and everybody they met now was confident that the french armies were going to hold the germans while the russian steam roller hurtled over prussia and captured berlin the french military authorities had been so confident that they had planned a giant movement of their forces through alsace and lorraine they would break the german lines at the south then sweeping north cut the communications of the enemy advancing through belgium and northern france the papers told about the beginning of this counterattack and what it was intended to do then suddenly they fell silent and the next reports of fighting in this district came from places in france those who understood military affairs knew what this meant that the armies of la patrie had sustained a grave defeat as to what was happening farther north not all the censorship in the land could hide the facts from the public one had only to take a map and mark on it the places where fighting was reported and he would see that it was the german steam roller or twenty miles a day the little belgian army was fighting desperately but was being swept aside its forts were being pulverized by heavy artillery and towns and villages in the path of the invasion were being wrecked and burned the still smaller british army which had been landed at the channel ports was apparently meeting the same fate the kaiser was on his way to paris there came a letter from sophie baroness de la tourette that very lively lady had been having an adventure and wrote about it in detail being shut up in a room in a fourth class hotel in paris much bored with nothing to do she had gone to spend the month of august with friends at a country place on the river maas which flows through the heart of belgium sophie was a nonpolitical person entirely devoted to having a good time she rarely looked at newspapers and when she heard people talking about war threats she paid no attention being unable to take seriously the of her social position the ladies she was visiting shared her attitude news traveled slowly in the country and when at last they heard that the germans had crossed the frontier they did not worry the army would be going to france and it might be interesting to watch it pass only when they heard the sound of heavy guns did they realize that they might be in danger and then it was too late a troop of uhlans with long lances came galloping up the driveway and the automobiles and horses on the place were seized soon afterward arrived several limousines and elegant officers descended and with bowing and heel clicking informed the ladies of the regrettable need to take the chateau for a temporary staff headquarters they all had wasp waists and wore monocles long gray coats gold bracelets and shiny belts and boots their manners were impeccable and they spoke excellent english and seemed to be well pleased with a lady who was introduced as miss sophie had suddenly realized that under the law being married to a frenchman she was french and might be interned for the period of the war that night she sent her maid to the village and succeeded in hiring a cart and an elderly bony white horse taking only a suitcase she and the maid and a peasant driver had set out toward brussels there was fighting everywhere to the south and east of them and the roads were crowded with refugees driving dogcarts trundling handcarts or carrying their belongings on their backs more than once they had had to sit for long periods by the roadside to let the german armies pass and the woman s letter was full of amazed horror at the perfection of the kaiser s war machine for
you ve made your men comfortable for the night i ll have mr wiswell with me and we ll be even more eager to hear what he has to say than he ll be to talk to us as we moved out to the open space the judge repeated name after name to delancey who snapped them out in a voice that must i thought be audible on staten island that clone the judge took us to his own hut which like the hospital and all the other shelters was nothing but a roof of branches supported by four tree trunks to my surprise the hut already had an occupant and it had a ready made audience too for on every side of it sat and stood scores of loyalists their eyeballs white in the lantern light and their hands perpetually brushing at mosquitoes made a pale flickering as of a half moonlight chair beside the occupant of the hut who was lying on a thick mat of sedge in the light of the lanterns his thin face had a waxy pallor but his black eyes sparkled and his lips were curved in a smile that was both patient and sardonic the judge leaned clown and looked at him seemed reassured by what he saw then said to me this is the reverend edmund lane mr wiswell one of these days he ll be a bishop but we almost lost him this afternoon because he thought the rebels would nt shoot their own countrymen we took four buckshot out of his shoulder lane moved his hand in a small gesture that took in all the men outside the hut they ve come here for news judge you d better arrange to give it to them or they ll stand around all night wait ing the judge turned to me mr wiswell have you any information for us in regard to him to move to our relief no i said and i spoke loudly so that i might be heard at a considerable distance i m sorry i m not a carrier of information but a seeker for it i do nt know the general s plans or how long he may be delayed before attacking my instructions are only to find out your numbers and the conditions under which you live and report on em to the general i heard voices muttering in disappointment and then after a moment or two the word declaration it was repeated from here and there declaration declaration until it became a general insistent outcry declaration declaration the judge looked at me apologetically we ve all heard congress issued a declaration of independence a short time ago but nobody can tell us what was in it can you by any chance tell us what it s bout i can give you a general idea i ca nt recite it for ou but two sentences stick in my mind and i can say em for you word for word every loyalist almost knows its first sentence when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation somewhere among the close packed circle of listeners a man laughed abruptly and the laughter spread as a ripple progresses upon the surface of a pool judge hendon raised his hand and the laughter died away do you know who wrote the paper he asked thomas jefferson i m told sir the judge nodded i did you not when it becomes necessary for one people he made an exasperated movement four fifths of the people on this island are loyal two thirds of the people in new york and pennsylvania are loyal more than half the people in all of north america are loyal it looks to me as though mr jefferson has nt a high respect for the opinions of mankind not if he wants mankind to think that i and all the others who have fled to the security of this swamp and another million of our fellow countrymen are not people you ll be equally interested in the other sentence i said it reads we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness well well judge hendon said so all men are created of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he shook his head i suppose we in this swamp are supposed to be in possession of our liberty and engaged in the pursuit of happiness since mr jefferson declares them to be our unalienable rights an angry muttering rose from the crowd of listeners the reverend mr lane raised a protesting hand no profanity please model yourselves on judge hendon do nt make matters worse by speaking indiscreetly or with improper heat oh my no buell said when the neighbors tar and feather you do nt ever call em anything worse than the said neighbors if you get too hot about it you can relieve yourself with whereas and feloniously like this whereas the said neighbors did feloniously tar and feather my aforesaid hide including my aforesaid hair my said nose and aforesaid fingernails therefore know all men and so on yes i went on hastily those two sentences are the only ones i can quote exactly but the document speaks of the abuses suffered by residents of north america at england s hands it says that the king of england has refused his assent to wholesome laws and plans the establishment of absolute tyranny over
dreams that shake us nightly these terrible dreams that shake us nightly that shake us nightly but not if he thought of delano by daylight there was a dark star for him to steer by in broad daylight a fixed and steadying star and all he needed was to keep his eyes on it he said to himself as he returned for his last afternoon at the camp and it was thus that the afternoon passed for delano was with him wherever he walked or stood not upright any more not waiting there on his feet with his white hands hanging at his side but laid straightly in his grave horizontal forever his head no longer bent upon his shoulders the flashlight gone out for of this morning s calmness at the same time that he kept on repeating to himself i know now what i have done it is something the consequences of which i must never expect to escape i have killed a man because of me this man is no longer erect in the sunshine standing there for other people to look at i have laid him down i have laid him down out of everybody s sight except mine and lucy s and since he can not stand again it is our task to keep him from trying to keep his peace for him i am not thinking of our peace of his he did not seek this peace and i gave it to him for no reason but i did give it to him and if i made the terrible mistake of hiding what i had done even the next day it was too late it would be a greater mistake now to shatter the silence in which he sleeps and in which our minds a sleeping man a man for whose peace we are responsible once it crossed ray s mind that suspicion might settle upon him after he had disappeared and the thin smile of donaldson hung in front of him for a moment like a threat but then he remembered that he had never strictly been under suspicion and the fear was answered at last by certain words of lena s which spoke themselves in his ear we know about lucy yes they all knew about lucy that would be enough for them to talk about and think about day in and day out for weeks and months and yet they knew nothing about lucy he knew so much and now so entirely so tenderly loved her as he thought forward across the diminishing stretch of time until it should be nine o clock it was she who had quieted the world for him and brought it into order or into all the order he deserved the most he could possibly deserve was this unrest which would last oh it might last forever leaving him to be sure but half alive a man merely not rest less a mind merely not tortured there had been a time when he expected more from the world but he was lucky to have this much to be going away from windless like this so utterly unnoticed it was almost as if windless did not care what he had done it was tolerating his departure it was turning its head while he and lucy slipped out in the darkness and perhaps it was exacting its penalty after all by ignoring them thus it was letting them die away from it into the silence of which their thoughts henceforward would be composed ray until now had been unable to imagine himself in any other place with lucy nor did he see the place now he only saw them in a deep silence watching each other s thoughts passing nights and days perhaps without a single word as they waited in the would be no more of these terrible dreams he shook himself it was time to go and dress in the half darkness of number and to see whether there was anything under the bed besides his clothes to take off these he had on and fold them neatly for dutch to find whenever dutch should pick up the courage to enter a cabin which was not for innocent men to enter he entered it and went straight to the bed on which a beam from the arc light fell through the drawn curtains casting black shadows underneath into which ray hesitated only an instant to plunge his hand nothing was there to feel or see besides his clothes but he gasped as he realized it and undressed and dressed with a haste which told him that his nerves were no longer as steady as they had been for the only way for him to go where he was going now was by the path to the spring and thence by the gravel road and all at once he was not as he would have to come in turn to the spring to the overflow to the crotched maple and to the place in the gravel where on a certain night no darker than this one he came forth from the cabin resolutely he must go at once for the time had arrived he must stop this devil of his thought stop it by the very regularity of his pace now that he had started down the path the scheme appeared to be working for ray deviating at no moment from the pace he set his feet and saying lucy s name to himself as if it were a charm against the darkness advanced past each of the points he had enumerated without so much as a flick of his head or a leap of his nerve the only thing he noticed was that in his imagination he walked faster and faster past each critical turn not actually faster for he could test himself there but by some illusion so it was as if two one ran
exploring all its possibilities before he went on to the next judy talking the whole time pulled all her treasures out in a heap took a quick glance at them and went straight for the one she liked best a minikin black baby in a wicker cradle toby pulled all his out too but he arranged them in a neat pattern on the eiderdown and looked at them for a long time in complete silence then he picked up squirls inside and put it by itself a little way off after that he played with the other toys appreciatively enough but from time to time his eyes would stray towards mrs miniver the glass marble as though to make sure it was still waiting for him mrs miniver watched him with a mixture of delight and misgiving it was her own favourite approach to life but the trouble was that sometimes the marble rolled away judy s was safer vin s on the whole the wisest of the three to the banquet of real presents which was waiting downstairs covered with a red and white dust sheet the stocking toys of course were only an aperitif but they had a special and exciting quality of their own perhaps it was the atmosphere in which they were opened the chill the black window panes the unfamiliar hour perhaps it was the powerful charm of the miniature of toy toys of smallness squared perhaps it was the sense of limitation within a strict emptier of a christmas stocking something of the same enjoyment which is experienced by the writer and the reader of a sonnet or perhaps it was merely that the spell of the old legend still persisted even though for everybody in the room except toby the legend itself was outworn three stockings there were cross currents of pleasure too smiling glances exchanged by her and vin about the two younger children she remembered suddenly having been an eldest child the unsurpassable sense of grandeur that such glances gave one and by her and clem because they were both grown ups and by her and judy because they were both women and by her and toby because they were both the kind that leaves the glass marble till the end the room was laced with an invisible network of affectionate understanding this was one of the moments thought mrs miniver which paid off at a single stroke all the accumulations on the debit side of parenthood the morning sickness and the quite astonishing pain the pram cook s eye the holiday nurse who had been in the best families the pungent white mice the shrivelled caterpillars the plasticine on the door handles the face flannels in the bathroom the nameless horrors down the crevices of armchairs the alarms and emergencies the swallowed button the inexplicable ear ache the ominous rash appearing on the eve of a journey the school bills and the dentists bills the shortened step the tempered pace the emotional compromises the divided loyalties the adventures continually forsworn and now vin was eating his tangerine pig by pig judy had undressed the baby doll and was putting on its frock again back to front toby was turning the glass marble round and round against the light trying to count the squirls there were sounds of movement in the house they were within measurable distance of the blessed chink of early morning tea mrs miniver looked towards the window the dark sky had already paled a little in its frame of cherry pink one had to frame it in something to see it at all twelfth night was over the decorations were down christmas which like all extremes dates easily seemed as demode as a hat in a passport photograph and still mrs miniver had not bought herself a new engagement book but was scribbling untidy notes on the fly leaf of the old one as usual she had meant to buy one before leaving london for starlings but as usual there had nt been time it is a thing she knew which must never be done in a hurry an engagement book is the most important of all those small adjuncts to life that tribe of humble familiars which jog along beside one from year s end to year s end apparently trivial but momentous by reason of their terrible intimacy a sponge a comb a tooth brush a spectacle case a fountain pen these are the things which need to be chosen much a part of one that they can scarcely be classed as inanimate insensitive certainly but so are one s nails and hair and although some of them can be given away if one takes a dislike to them with others the only remedy is destruction and there is no case on record of anybody however rich being strong minded enough to throw an almost new sponge into the fire meekly one puts up with its inconvenient shape its repulsive texture and the cretinous face which is discernible among its contours when it is lightly squeezed eventually thank goodness it will wear out or with any luck one may leave it behind in an hotel but an engagement book once used is a far worse problem to give it away is impossible to lose it is disastrous and to scrap it and start a new one entails a laborious copying out of all the entries that have already been made unless of course one is prepared to risk giving one s biographers if any the impression that one has the new engagement book suffered from a prolonged attack of leprosy or worse so it was nt until well into january that mrs miniver up for the day from starlings to go to the dentist found herself in a stationer s shop with enough leisure to give the matter the attention it deserved she stopped in front of the rack marked diaries and prepared to enjoy
chapel sir how could we have known then that what happened that night so small so foolish would be the cause of misery to us all elias never forgot that night but his revenge was the sweeter when he had chance to have it sweet it was and greatly he relished it and every morsel of it he took but even of him i can think of with sorrow now at this moment those times those people daughters and their shop have gone how can there be fury felt for things that are gone to dust chapter ninei i ere in this quiet house i sit thinking back the structure of my life building again that which has fallen it do seem to me that the life of man is merely a pattern scrawled on time with little thought little care and no sense of design why is it i wonder that people suffer when there is so little need when an effort of will and some hard work would bring them from their misery into peace and contentment the slag heap is moving again i can hear it whispering to itself and as it whispers the walls of this brave little house are girding themselves to withstand the assault for months more than i ever thought it would have the courage to withstand that great mound has borne down upon these walls this roof and for those months the great bully has been beaten they were craftsmen stout beams honest blocks good work and love for the job all that is in this house but the slag heap moves pressing on down and down over and all round this house which was my father s and my mother s and now is mine soon perhaps in an hour the house will be buried and the slag heap will stretch from the top of the mountain right down to the river in the valley poor river how beautiful you were how gay your song how clear your green waters how you enjoyed your play among the sleepy rocks i shall always remember the day i saw you after i had been in bed so long that morning mr gruffydd came to the house early and opened the door of the kitchen so that the sun shone in all round him big he looked and full of happy purpose good morning mrs morgan he said good morning surprise there is good to see you tot how green was my valley i have come for huw he said as though he was asking to take a loaf for old mrs llywarch huw my mother asked and looked over the table at me with her eyebrows almost touching this little blue cloth yes said mr gruffydd this is the morning he has been waiting for i ji looked at mr gruffydd and knew but my mother was still in fog with her the daffodils are out mama i said oh huw my mother said and put down the bread knife and turned her head away where are your clothes huw he asked me but quiet and look ing at my mother s back under my pillow sir i said your pillow he said for these months come you then he said and smiling he was you shall bring back a posy fit for a queen for your brave mother is it indeed i will i said and back i pulled the pillow and out came my clothes that i had made ready ever since i had put my mind to the matter pain there was and a helpless feeling in all my bones but i was determined to have those clothes on on they went and no nonsense though the stockings were big and the trews too short but i had grown and got thin so it was no use to grumble there is a sight i must have looked when i put my legs out and stood up but neither mr gruffydd nor my mother looked at me so i was spared to blush and very thankful up on my back huw mr gruffydd said and bent his knees so that i could put my shocked i was to find myself up on the shoulders of a minister it seemed wrong to be so familiar but there i was and carried to the door ile will be back in two hours mrs morgan my little one said mr gruffydd god bless you my mother said and still not looking how green was my valley good bye our lam i said with my legs falling about at the back get ready the big pot for the daffodils i will have an armful for you and some for bron outside then and through the blessed curtains of air spun with morning mist and sunshine blown upon us by wind from the southeastand the draughts that played in the valley are you right huw mr gruffydd asked me am i too quick no indeed mr gruffydd i said go you is the road and up by there are the daffodils tight now for the first few minutes i was shutting my eyes to get used to the sunshine so raw and pure and shining white then i got used to it and less tears came and i was able to see without screwing up my eyes and having to blink the first thing i saw was the slag heap big it had grown and long and black without life or sign lying along the bottom of the valley on both sides of the river the green grass and the reeds and the flowers all had gone crushed beneath it and every minute the burden grew as cage after cage screeched along the cables from the pit bumped to a stop at the tipping pier and emptied dusty loads on to the ridged black dirty back on our side of the valley the heap reached to
then i thought were not taken up he was unnaturally quiet earlier in the evening i had shown him where i had slept the night before and now he opened the door into the room mrs hale had had he said i m going out chace i want to try out another idea will you go in there where mrs hale slept and stay for ten minutes this room we ll leave dark when the ten minutes are up turn out the light in there and come back in here you can feel your way to the bed and lie down right where you slept last night beside this window you said belding s car stood where ours does now did nt you all right then will you please stay here on the bed without any lights until i come back strain your ears for any sound try to putwe make a test run yourself into the mood of last night if you can that would help i did try sat on eunice hale s bed and went back over all the details of our trip down from canada it was very quiet once i thought i heard a radio somewhere one car went over the back road and two dogs barked during the ten minutes it seemed more like half an hour then i put out the light and groped my way in complete darkness to the other bed and lay down there was no sound now last night there had been an occasional moan from mrs hale i continued to ponder the smallest happenings of the previous night wondering which of them bruce considered significant what had brought him here tonight did he think the same thing would happen again when that idea came to me my pulse grew a little stronger and it was just then that i heard the queer swishing sound i d heard before as though something were being dragged outside my window my neck felt suddenly very bare at the back and my effort to prick them up there was a very faint click as though someone had tapped two pieces of metal like two silver knives together it was no sharper than that i had nt heard quite that sound before it had been slightly different there were some muffled indistinguishable noises and then the movements that i had taken for those of a big dog now there should be the whimper of a little dog but that could nt happen again because tippy was sick or dead i wondered which after a short silence i was startled by an entirely unexpected noise a man s voice pitched so death thumbs a ridelow i could nt make out any words but it sounded as if something had gone wrong was it perkins had someonefound him there was he in danger i wanted to rush out but he had asked me to stay there and stay there i did getting more uneasy each second i did nt look out the direction of the voices one voice perkins this time for sure suddenly came clearly through the window chace it said chace and then as i started to get to my feet stay there i do nt need you i ll be right in did he want someone else to know i was awake and listening a few seconds later our door opened and perkinsswitched on the light inside he came over to the bed his eyes glowing well he said and waited i told him all that i d heard and just how it had differed from what i d heard the night before who else was there whom were you talking to i finished i ll tell you tomorrow he promised and took one quick turn across the room and back now we must get some sleep we re going to be busy tomorrow we did and woke me up when my eyes were clear enough to see him i thought he could nt have been asleep at all but he said he had i ve got another idea about that test run to senator frary s it came to me after you were asleep but i wanted to try it by daylight it was having that on my mind that woke me up i ll get the car started hurry chris i was glad as i dragged on my clothes that it had not been possible to try this new idea in the dark we make a test run we slipped through patterson easily enough this morning with no traffic and no lights yet to stop us when we got to the side road at the first corner of the frary estate perkins turned into it let s see what s up here he suggested it was a narrow road with a graveled surface hard enough for the little traffic woodland were on our left the house gardens orchards and more woodland on our right we could see the stables and dairy on the farm side with a crossroad cutting through to the opposite side in a short straight line our road bore somewhat to the left we drove slowly taking all this in there was enough upwardgrade to make it just possible to run in high gear at our slow speed at the top which was the upper corner of frary s place the road ended at a slightly better and wider highway running at right angles to ours ah this is what i wanted perkins said and without hesitation turned to the right a mile more or less brought to sight the great white pile of the frary house its back to us i was surprised to see it so close but bruce was nt i suspected there must be a road rather close to it back here he told corner where we turned and see where this road goes in the other direction we had to run half

brilliant i ever had he undoubtedly went far you do nt know what became of him unfortunately no but i m convinced that wherever he is he s very successful aside from classes consistently jimmie hayes was a natural born leader i believe he was considered a very able athlete also football you know he ought to be easy to find then johnny commented now about one more boy archibald fitzgerald the professor did nt remember him so well but after screwing up his eyes a while he nodded yes archibald no i m sorry but i ca nt say as much for him in fact i remember he was an even poorer student than young chester i may be wrong as the boy did nt make much of an impression on me that however seems to bear out my contention i remember the bright students that s natural professor well thanks a lot you too principal johnny left the school and rejoined sam who had climbed out of the flivver a near by window how d you make out johnny so so anyway i got their addresses as of all we have to do is run them down now sam groaned could nt we have another beer first no this requires a clear head come on pile into the bus webster was one block south they turned right and consulted the house numbers

the door could scarcely speak english a pimply faced youth of about sixteen opened the door of the other flat we only been living here a year he told johnny naw i never heard of no hayes around here johnny went downstairs to the printing shop they had occupied their quarters tenants above did not even know the names of the present ones johnny returned to the fliver and discovered that sam was missing irritably he pressed the horn and sam popped out of the saloon across the street wiping his mouth damn it sam he snapped when his friend came across the street i told you to lay off that sure but i been doing some investigating johnny the old coot who runs that joint s lived around here all his life johnny muttered under his breath and started across the street sam followed the old coot was about fifty and weighed five times his age what ll it be gents he said wiping the bar with a towel that had an odor of stale beer strong enough to asphyxiate a man two beers johnny said and some talk my pal tells me you ve lived around here all your the bartender drawing two beers i been in the saloon business thirty years during prohibition we had curtains in the windows remember the hayes family who lived across the street about twenty years ago do i remember mickey hayes exclaimed the bartender sure and it was a sad day when he was hit by a streetcar my best customer mickey had a son

tried again take it slow now what became of jimmie hayes do you know sure i know was nt his old man me best cus tomer a fine old man even if he did drink a drop too much now and then specially on saturday nights when he had his pay with him johnny roared what became of jimmie jimmie i can hear you you do nt have to holler like that jimmie was a mighty fine lad bright as a polished spittoon

heaving the beer mug through the nicely decorated back bar mirror he controlled himself with an effort i ll give you one more chance he said grimly archibald fitzgerald who lived right around the corner on sedgwick street would you mr fitzgerald cried the saloon keeper now there s a man ye can be proud of maybe he did squeeze a money and he got somewhere with it johnny regarded the bartender darkly where did he get are you joking you mean to say you never heard of mister archibald fitzgerald him that s so rich and made it all in the stock market when everybody was losing their shirts including meself who took a little flyer in gramatan silver and had to borrow from the brewery to keep goin hold
to cm ai nt it a shame she s having herself such a big time with the wilson pulchritude me i say it was a hellish cruelty not to put you at the bigptable with the old folks where that marvelous mrs florian is of course it s perfectly natural for you to go goofy over her hatcher because it runs in your family i hear what oh yes lennie said my mother told me yesterday that just before the giddy sarah started in marrying around everywhere she was supposed to be engaged to one of your relatives one of my rel the recollection of wild imaginings of his own rushed upon the staggered hatcher you re crazy my father my father never your father lennie was first astounded then uproarious why s even older than she is how long since your father was a bachelor and in a position to be engaged to anybody about twenty five years her laughter was louder and louder no little rollo it was nt your father everybody thought she was going to marry it was your uncle just only your uncle that s all you hatcher began but his self possession was gone in a quavering voice you re just crazy was all that he was able to say no dearie lennie returned smiling upon him cruelly it was my mother told me look at her she s sitting at the big mature table next to your own poor father that you ve been traducing does nt she look fairly sane she told me it was never announced but everybody was sure mr victor linley and the giddy sarah were just about to put up the banns when bingo the gal mexican she never never in her life married a mexican lennie leaped at the chance he gave her never in her whole life not once not one single mexican just stuck to french and span you re a marvel i locher contrived to interrupt and horribly aware that he was trembling all over steadied his hands by resting them upon the edge of the table just to think that all this noise could come from such a little chest and throat sweet of nam lennie squealed i wish you could see your face goggy eyed over sacrilege what here s a cute one for you adorable it s by special request that your uncle victor s sitting next to the guest of honor ii hose special request presh why hers aunt eleanor could nt help telling piquant what under the circumstances would nt it be rapturous and maybe some day you ll be calling her aunt sarah what a cut up you are hatcher had strength enough to say savagely as he turned his shoulder upon her cackling voices blasphemed in sacred hidden grottoes where he was an acolyte his nerves seemed to rock he was bewildered insulted thrown down stamped upon and scarified with lennie s laughter stinging into his reddened left ear he swung to mary gilpin a movement that was in reality a flight for shelter behind this always cool high minded girl he hoped to collect himself and be at least a little ready if lennie struck again i suppose you ve heard some of the tripe i ve been talking with that pinwheel on the other side of me he asked yes mary gilpin said if you re really worried about mrs florian s age hatcher i think you can calculateit with some accuracy i had nt happened to hear that course it s legendary what flutters he caused for years after he came home from the last war i believe though mrs florian was nt much over twenty two or twenty three the first time she was married and left here and she s been away only a dozen years or so you see that comes fairly close she could easily be no more than thirty five or even as young as thirty four i m not interested i m not interested in people s ages no hatcher of course everybody s been talking about her these weeks she s been home though i understandthey always did even when she was quite a young girl she s the sort of person who creates that creates what talk mary said she emanates something everybody sgot to look at her it s as if she herself so intensely feels that she s the star of the play that her emotional conviction of her starship spreads a thought her just at the moment but they re all conscious of her all the time and she could hardly bear it if they were nt you see that inevitably makes anybody who s much seen with her talked about too do nt be angry with lennie though she s only being loyal loyal what a ridiculous no mary gilpin said she s not the only one who could feel hurt on dorcy s account hatcher what he stared at her hotly on dorcy s account why dorcy why weeks ago she practically dropped me for he laughed roughly oh what s it matter mary gave him a steady look are you going to let dorcy go let her go what do you lean i have nt got her never did have she s are you mary gilpin asked arc for cripe s sake i atelier felt he had enough to bear without having these two girls try to make him feel guilty guilty of what had nt he a right to his own life what was everybody trying to do to him see here he began i ve always been dorcy s friend and always will be but i certainly into his left ward ribs little lennie aldrich spiked her elbow again listen ca nt you listen even to the music what music from a corridor outside the dining room there came the strains of a harp a flute a violin
that s what we got to think about and talk about did i ever have any other reason it s for them that i want to take advantage of this opportunity if i can make a go of it i can give them what i want them to have and what you ought to want them to have too i want to do my share nobody s asking you to do anything i know that when you re able you ll be only too glad to do anything you can but now did i say one word about it did i mildred there s one thing i can do want to do it i can see that you have a place to sleep and that the kids have and that nobody can take it away from you i want to give you the house mildred caught wholly by surprise wanted to laugh and wanted to cry the house had long ceased to be a possession so far as she was concerned it was a place that she lived in and that crushed her beneath interest taxes and upkeep that bert with a straight face should offer it to her at this time struck her as merely grotesque and yet she remembered what mrs gessler had said and knew she was in the presence of a man and his pride she got up suddenly went over and put her arms around him you do nt have to do that mildred i want to if you want to there s only one thing i can do and that is i want you to know that all right but you ve got to take it i m sorry i said what i did about mrs biederhof i ve been hating myself for what i said about wally christ i know there d never be anything between you and that fat slob but we keep saying things that s it that we do nt mean that we could nt mean bert do nt you think i hate this just as much as you do but it s got to be for their sake yeah for their sake they talked low and close for a long time and then got to laughing over the way he looked when she hit him with the dough then they got to laughing over the charges she would have to bring and the cruelties he had been guilty of i guess you ll have to hit her and caused her great mental and physical anguish you talk like veda she s always wanting to be hit i m glad there s a little of me in her he doubled his fist brushed her chin with it then they both burst into shaking uncontrollable sobs the gams the gams your face ai nt news it was a moment before mildred quite knew what was meant but then she gave her skirt a little hitch and was nt exactly displeasedwhen a photographer whistled mrs gessler having no gams to speak of stood behind her and the bulbs went off next thing she knew she was in court raising her hand swearing to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her god and giving her name address and occupation which she described as housewife then she was answering questions put to her by sympathetic red haired man who gently urged her to tell an elderly judge the story of bert s unendurablecruelties his silences during which he would nt speak to her for days on end his absences from home his striking her in an argument over money then she was sitting beside wally and mrs gessler was up there corroborating everything she said with just the right shade of repressed indignation when mrs gessler got to the blow and wally asked her sternly if she had actually seen it she closed her eyes and whispered i did then mildred and mrs gessler were out in the corridor where wally presently joined them o k decree s entered my so soon that s how it goes when you got a properly prepared ease no trouble about a divorce if it s handled right the law says cruelty and that s what you got to prove but that s all you got to prove argument he drove them home and mildred made drinks and bert came in to sign papers she was glad somehow that since the real estate deal started wally had been curiously silent about romance it permitted her to sit beside bert without any sense of deceit and really feel friendly toward him the first chance she got she whispered in his ear i told them the property settlementhad been reached out of court the reporters i mean was that all right perfectly that this elegant announcement should come out in the papers she knew meant a great deal to him she patted his hand and he patted back wally left and then bert after a wistfullook at his glass decided he had to go too but something caught in mildred s throat as he went down the walk his hat at what was intended to be a jaunty angle his shoulders thrown bravely back mrs gessler i do nt know i feel as though i d picked his bones first his kids and then his car and now the house and everything he s got will you kindly tell me what good the house would do him on the first call for interest he d lose it would nt he but he looked so pitiful baby they all do that s what gets us pt was a hot morning in october her last at the restaurant the previous two weeks had been a mad scramble in which it had seemed she would never find time for all she had to do there had been visits to los angeles street to order the

herself that she did not really love stanley william loved her in his peculiar way which strangely enough seemed to her gluttonous yes that was the only word for it but his wife had never loved the child not even when she was an adorable smiling baby in a cap and coat of white fur it was william notwithstanding his thick husk of vanity who would be hurt by what hap pened or did not happen to stanley for william loved his niece as an old man loves the remembered ecstasy of his youth why i saw her myself william growled knotting his forehead until his eyebrows hung like tufts of dried grass over the blinking anger in his eyes i saw her as i was coming out yesterday afternoon i was later than usual and it must have been six o clock her way downtown in peter s car peter was driving and bless my soul i noticed him because he almost ran into a truck at the corner of seventh and washington grazed it by an inch i called to baxter to stop when the car skidded into the gutter rattlebrained driving if ever i saw it sir what i can never understand is how a man who drives like that should be able to cut up people without killing them but they re all rattlebrained now the whole bunch of them i was just saying to my wife when you came in that all this modern racket and stanley s no better than the rest of em sticks in my gizzard then peter must know where she was going charlotte murmured why do nt you ask peter asa smiled faintly but his smile was scarcely more than an ironic flicker over the stiffened mask of his features we ca nt ask not come back where s he gone thundered william he had a call out of town dr bellamy i think he said called him to operate he told roy he might not get home till this morning but this morning he did nt come he has not come tonight it s half past nine now william drew out his watch and looked at it indignantly it s a quarter to ten he may still come charlotte suggested feebly i do nt know asa s gaze wandered round the room and came to rest on her bulging figure seated like some emblem of domestic security on her plum colored cushions i called up bellamy well well i said sir william s face had flushed from gray to purple while he lifted a shaking hand to pluck unsteadilyat his collar button sliding from her chair to her uncertain feet glass if water which she held to her husband s lips this is the only thing except his own flesh that could hurt william she thought if anything has happened to stanley he could nt tell me asa answered slowly he did nt know he said he had nt asked him to operate out of town had nt asked him do you mean asa moistened his lips but they were still so stiff that he had to wait a minute before replying i do nt mean anything i do nt know anything i m in a in a william s features were suddenly convulsed as if he were choking you ve got to mean something he burst out damn it all sir you ve got to mean something the explosion left asa unshaken he was the color of wood that has herself rambling and the smudges under his eyes looked as if they had been rubbed in with charcoal men are so helpless in trouble she thought with a sigh why is it when they spend all their lives facing facts that they should never have learned how to meet an emergency i thought you might have heard something asa was saying but you ca nt think they re together charlotte cried out you ca nt think she s gone off with with peter asa shook his head again i ca nt think i ve stopped thinking but stanley could nt she she is nt she is nt like that i do nt know what she s like asa s voice was hard and level i do nt know what anybody is like she s like all the others william stormed while charlotteunderstood as she her uneasy marriage she had seen her husband stripped to the bone stripped even of that masculine vanity which he had worn always like a protective layer of fat but if that girl by god charlotte if a niece of mine do nt william please william an impending nameless fear had yielded to the immediate horror of an apoplectic stroke under her very eyes you will make yourself sick a smothered gurgling and rumbling issued from william s throat i tell you i tell you asa stood up and straightened his shoulders i ll go now he said quietly there does nt seem to be anything else i can do where s craig asked charlotte with her apprehensive glance on her husband craig it was the first moment that any of them had thought of craig he s waiting for me outside what does he say he
suddenly was no longer the simple warm light hearted brother whom he thought he knew so well he was shocked to realize how little he really knew about this brother of his with could remember he was afraid he wished that he had never heard them talking this way he thought of the lake and believed that he would never go near it again he remembered how boys who were unwise enough to go swimming in its waters always broke out in a rash over their bodies and fishermen said that the fish in this lake were poisoned and no good he shuddered at his own thoughts ernie stopped the car in front of the house rain do nt seem to be letting up none we better run for it do nt forget your raincoat there on the floor they clattered up onto the porch together and molly met them at the door did nt you see him anywhere down around the lake pernie you ai nt seen nothing of mr higgins today have you molly s gloom spread a damper over all of them ernie stayed but a few minutes and when he left she followed him out onto the the street into the drizzle of rain as if she expected to see the bent figure of jud higgins coming along the sidewalk when she came in she said we better leave the front door unlocked in case mr higgins comes home sometime before morning the family trooped upstairs to bed and the last thing before she put out the lights and climbed the stairs molly went out to the little bedroom off the kitchen and looked at jud s empty bed not quite empty for tonight the old cat slept there undisturbed she moved to put him out and then she thought better of it the skinny old cat sleeping peacefully there with his mouth open and his legs sprawled stiffly seemed to her symbolic of old jud himself she decided to let him remain there warm and comfortable against the storm just as she was hoping that jud himself had found a refuge this night against the weather she sighed a little switched off the kitchen light and went the room at the end of the hall kenny sat on the edge of the bed and smoked a cigarette while carl undressed silently it was far too early in the night for the prospect of sleep to appear inviting to kenny he felt peculiarly alert and wakeful but it was no concern over jud higgins that kept him so carl climbed into bed on the other side and turned his back on his brother pulling the covers up over him kenny sat still with his elbows on his knees and wriggled his toes in his socks watching their busy agile movements appreciatively carl tossed the covers back suddenly and flopped over on his back in the bed shielding his eyes against the light in the crook of his elbow for god s sakes you coming to bed or are you gon na set up there all night with that light on well i ll tell you i ai nt decided yet see at the coldness the fit of nervous fear that he had experienced earlier in the evening he repeated the words that kenny had just spoken over and over in his mind studying his brother s strong back while he did so after the fifth or sixth time that he recalled them he found something hard and sinister in the words something quite to be expected in the way of conversation from a man who consorted with murderers and mobsters the sudden vivid thought image of the two limp bloody bodies slipping over the side of the boat and sinking silently to the bottom of the very lake that he had looked at every day of his life gave him a nasty start and turned his mouth dry kenny turned around to him suddenly what in hell s the matter with you tonight anyway your eyes look like a scared cat s you look like you got the jitters right carl stared back at kenny fascinated it seemed to him that kenny s half dosed blue eyes had a power to all surprised at kenny s next words what s the matter you ai nt still thinking about that stuff ernie and me was talking about tonight are you carl s mouth sagged open foolishly and he never took his eyes off his brother s face kenny appeared slightly bewildered look he said helplessly what you worrying about stuff like that for it ai nt nothing for you to worry about it happened a long time ago when you was just a little kid it s all done with now there ai nt been no mob around this town since repeal but the fear was still there before his eyes plain on carl s face you ai nt worried about what i said about a couple of stiffs sunk over there in the middle of the lake are you you been living here next to that lake ever since you been born and they ai nt never hurt you yet have they carl worked he kept staring at kenny fascinated and horror stricken kenny was completely baffled by something soft and sensitivein his brother that was beyond his understanding you ai nt thinking about that stuff ernie was feeding me about me getting hurt some day and ending up in a morgue some place it s a lot of baloney ernie just likes to hear himself talk there ai nt nothing to it i got lots of different kinds of friends it never made no difference to me what a guy did so long as i liked him but no guy is gon na shoot me full of holes or nothing else so long as i do nt give him no cause to carl licked at
might have just wandered off everyone does around here at this point lieutenant conrad came in to report he took in the situation and was on the point of retreating when raymurder makes us gay abruptly dismissed the trio polly flew to monte and clutched his arm reynolds withdrew reluctantly when all three were gone conrad said no word from naylor has nt landed at the regular field we ve about finished the routine business decker is finishing the last batch looks like the whole hotel had a good night s rest so far nothing to poke holes in doc wants to know if you ve got any objections if they take the body now the boat s leaving with a load of baggage and it might as well go along with that when he had ray s consent he continuedbluntly they ve and those are banks the rest of the room is lousy with em you ca nt get much of a lead from that but your guess about the chair seems pretty good those are bloodstainson the arm of it i d say he was shot there and then heaved under the table though the devil knows why to hide him ray spoke impatiently as though he had gone far ahead of conrad s slow exposition they did nt want him found until morning but why i ll know a lot when i know that ray replied shortly he was beginning to show the strain of his all night vigil conrad fingered his pipe shot ray a look and then remarked well i guess i ll get me some food it s noontime my god denny ejaculated i ve got to get out of here i d forgotten all about the band hall with lou trotting behind him he ran his hand over his chin but the stubble was not reassuring he d have to take time to shave lou be a good scout and tell jim i ll be five minutes late tell him oh never mind do nt tell him anything he knows all the answers murder makes us gaylou signified that she understood when they came to the rotunda she dashed down the hall that led to the rear of the building while denny made for his room he half hoped that the death in the house would put a ban on the music making but he suspected paine would nt allow it he nicked himself a couple of times in his haste which did nt improve his mood when he arrived on the terrace spruce enough and with the usual required boutonniere he found the dancing floor was crowded jim baxter favored denny with a distinctly sour look he could nt tolerate tardiness and denny disguise the bleeding nicks was definitely below par teddy the curly haired drummer grinned at denny as he took his place laugh clown laugh he muttered while he bounced around on his seat on with the dance though your heart be breaking shut up denny replied as out of the corner of his eye he saw jim s thunderous expression they played three numbers and then when the crowd kept clapping two encores after that jim ignored them and the couples sauntered back to their tables murder makes us gay teddy said continuing his monologue what s the big idea the callousness of denny kicked him in the shin whereupon he lapsed into an injured silence concealed behind denny s broad back jim had come up and was looking his reproof denny accepted it meekly i thought we d be in mourning today he remarked jim merely handed the notes to denny practiced it this morning denny felt his ears burn he d even forgotten that jim had called a special rehearsal something he did once in a bluemurder makes us gay moon well a man is nt murdered every day that ought to be a valid excuse except for the suppressed excitement in the atmosphere the hotel life was going on as usual the scene was just the same with the same cliques sitting together the same routine of chatter laughter and drink the gay young things the sedate old things and the smart in between things carrying out their various performances the only really big change was the fact that polly and monte did nt do the rhumba the hour ran over to one thirty and people still thronged the terrace when the musicians put up their instruments and strode off for their lunch jim remarked to denny chesty was sure the season would be killed it looks like just the opposite guests were getting bored now they ve got do nt get scared off by a little murder if anything it give the season a lift denny agreed with him and the afternoon proved he was right not only reporters arrived by the boatloads but there was a sudden request for rooms paine of course did nothing to discourage the trade and ray had no reason to forbid new arrivals at four denny found ray sequestered in his room in the village and surrounded by reports the air was blue with smoke when denny came in his set expression relaxed he folded his arms behind his head and indulged in a tremendous stretch phew i never met up with a case like this one denny undid his tie and unbuttoned his shirt before he sat down it s as hot as hell in here and stinks too how can you think ray looked surprised and sniffed oh that smell is from the landlady something she cooks i m well i guess you can get used to anything denny admitted tell me about the case any news from naylor ray brought down his arms and leaned over his notes not yet i m surprised because mclaughlin has sent out a description of him and it ca nt be difficult to recognize that setup even if he fell
yet voiceless words emanated from the insentient plaster she put her hand against it it was hard sing barren thy maker is thine husband a woman forsaken wife of youth the excruciating pain over her heart became less one breath and then another came without that scraping pain of gravel on raw flesh that breathing had been since her child died it had also been somewhat difficult to breathe for the month of waiting between the death of her husband and the birth of her son outside still evening had come down the regular thud of troops moved east along some distant highway at home the whistles had blown the men s boots ceased tapping along the cinders of the clearing and then down the hill each to his home in coldspring so far from this our war her father had come in at the side door his cane had clicked into the pan at the bottom of the hatrack through the door into the back hall came the odor of steak and potatoes frying there was a rice pudding cooling on the alone by the fire her place was empty she would go home what a fool she was how blind not to know that was the only place in the whole crazed and senseless world where life could still go on for her a letter from janet was

of mountains from which she would see once more the wyoming valley the train slowed for the curve and the grade before her in its own dream lay the valley the shadows of great violet based clouds made dark islands across the little knolls and undulations which rippled down the valley floor the train descended along the ridge everywhere the white smoke more alive than ostrich feathers rose from the collieries here was a presentation on a giant scale a continual pageant for the benefit of a theatrical looking and mascara lidded lady called progress and for an english widow stealing home again your face so far from this our war david had quoted in a letter even when she was in england and he still as near as the ypres salient sun everything changed not many would bother but some would remember that luke had walked out on her and would not realize that to her it no longer mattered her husband was dead his only son had also died new hartford in general would realize it was better that she had not been burdened with an english manor and the ritualistic social obligations they would feel very sure that all that would have bored sally winlock her father looking much grayer even in the first flash was standing gazing up through the car windows as the train pulled in she recognized the gabled station with colored tile entrance the old smell of hurry and luggage the same old bawled lists of stations still to come wilkes barre pittsville scranton carbondale and the deafening sound of escaping steam assaulted her ears she saw the white cloud of steam in the selfsame place where she and luke had realized each other s presence in eden when they reached the big house into the side hall her father holding her arm they went into the library she looked around she placed her stool by her father s chair and sat down as though she were still ten years old celestine had died so long ago david had died their child william s grandson had died she and her father had only each

as the wisteria he spread some honey on a piece of toast and the golden taste made him think of spring in general the season pricketh every gentle heart and maketh him out of his sleep to start he repeated to himself and suddenly there was a warm rush of emotion to his heart now god bless the spring he thought god bless it it was indeed the season of resurrection a symbol to all those who had ears to hear and eyes to see no man or woman should ever become entirely old or utterly hopeless so long as there was spring to look forward to or back upon and was nt the minds of gentle men all through the ages nothing could ever completely cut that cord of light no amount of temporary brutality or barbarism between gentle men and women dead living and to come there were a number of these cords of light they were like a secret radio code five hundred years ago a gentle poet thought felix chaucer felt the spring as i am feeling it now he lit a pipe and read the morning s news england was still enjoying a spell of unprecedented good weather and the english unused to this had turned from rejoicing to gloom the nation was deeply stirred stocks were unsteady felix wondered if they had ever been anything else hitler had made another speech now that the abused and homesick austrians had been taken back to the broad bosom of their racial mother germany had no further territorial ambitions any one who said she had was a liar he thank a famous psychopathologist in chicago had announced that america had a deteriorating social system only the totalitarian states seemed determined to eliminate the unfit and produce real men herr goebbels had been slapped by the husband of another actress the spring social season in philadelphia was reaching a climax it occupied a full page felix refilled his pipe and went up to the second story front sitting room to write some letters he was badly behind in his correspondence carl s note of welcome had been amusing and typical to the sound of cymbals and the aroma of the fatted calf carl had written i welcome you it s the only fatted calf you ll get but do nt tell your fellow citizens they would resent my presumption who am ito welcome any one to their city i am not a philadelphian i was born in albany and i have never really lived in philadelphia merely on the outskirts and then as no more than a none of the voluble contempt of the virginians nor have they the candid and courteous and dismaying blandness of charleston and they seldom have a trace of the icy rudeness of boston they ll merely not elect you to something it was one o clock before felix had finished reading his mail and had answered part of it and half past two and time for him to get ready for his appointment with the mysterious mr wilde before he was aware of it he went down into the hall and put on his coat reluctantly he knew little of the law in all his life come to think of it he had never but once consulted a lawyer and then only for the briefest of dealings his mother s estate had been so small he remembered the curt hurried young man he had seen in detroit felix s ideas of the profession were still largely taken from dickens and the pleasant and leisurely offices he had known in the village of maclean lawyers were either shrewd and kindly eyes who had been in politics or else young men of an equally dry wit who were going into politics he walked slowly up cassianut street to broad and then north along broad to chestnut and then west a half a block until he came to the forbidding facade grimy and ornate and palladian of the gibraltar trust company over the magnificent door of wrought bronze was the motto fide et fiducia which no doubt explained why the gibraltar trust company had been allowed by confiding stockholders to build an entirely profitless office building felix pushed a revolving glass door to the left of the wrought bronze door and found himself in a narrow hall where there was a battery of elevators in a gloomy voice he informed the operator of the one he was allowed to enter that he wished to get off at the eleventh floor he had never been able to make out whether business made people formidable or formidable people entered business but at all events a singular lack of cheerfulness no wonder periodic panic swept them like a wind through a cave the elevator came to a velvet stop and felix was urged into a long corridor where a series of doors stared at him like gray unfriendlyeyes on their upper panels of ground glass the names wilde holbrook mccormick and armstead there was not a humannote except two discreet solid wooden doors at the farther end of the corridor upon which in gold was on the door to the left the word men and on the door to the right the word women felix hesitated he was nervous and for a moment he had thought of going to the former and then he changed his mind hat in hand he timidly opened one of the glass panelled doors upon which in the lower right hand corner of the panel was the word entrance he peered around the door three elderly fates two of them engaged in typewriting at him they had the plumpness and unadorned neatness of women no longer interested in men in their eyes was the tranquil indignation of cows interrupted while feeding a very moral office thought felix at least on the surface is mr wilde in he stuttered and slid around the door
moving remember what a good time we had christmas i remember betsy said what kind of a job would you get honey something to do with clothes i guess that s what i d like you ve always had a knack well i do nt see why not bets i ll talk to your father he ought to be glad that you ve got some get up and git yes yes i always thought of it that way maizie the one who would make a brilliant marriage and have beautiful children you the clever one my poor darlin maizie she certainly has nt got what i ve wanted for her she s got nothing you always loved her more than me betsy thought quietly perhaps i wonder what are the ways i wonder how you make someone really love you best of all will daddy mind she said do nt worry darlin i ll take care of your father he s mostly got over what happened last winter but i think it kind of hurts him still might heal up better if you went away course i ll miss you darlin terribly but i do have the feeling this is what you were meant to do the clever one i m not clever betsy said but a tiny nerve jumped in her could i be the clever one clever betsy left for new york the first of june the untidy lilacs were all in bloom in the yard the day she left the road was shimmering black with tar a bobwhite called from the fields behind the house minnie may drove her in to the back bay station to take the one climbed all over her and squealed with excitement she had said goodbye to tom jekyll earlier before he left to catch his train after all the months when she realized he had tried not to have to look at her he put his arms around her and kissed her and when she put her head back she saw that there were tears in his eyes goodbye bets he said i still feel as if you were just a little tike you know going off like this daddy she said and kissed him again but more than anything she wanted to get away she could nt begin to think begin anything till she was clear away and could start fresh all the way in to the station minnie may talked steadily for they had just heard the great news maizie who had just gone home was going to have a baby it overshadowed everything else betsy realized that her mother maybe this will fix everything up for maizie betsy said bets that s what i m prayin for it s bound to make a big difference the only thing disturbs me maizie looks so poorly it takes a lot out of a woman to go through nine months of having a baby i dread it for her but if it ll bring that man around she s going to have to go to dr cunningham i m going to make her i just know he can do wonders for her she s got to do it for her own sake and my sake and the baby s sake all of our sakes they kissed goodbye on the gritty windy platform of the station as the train came roaring into the cave of the back bay betsy remembered how the engine used to rush in like this when she and leda march took the train home from school that was long long ago bags up on the car platform and she climbed the steps and turned at the top to wave to her mother minnie may waved back with both hands and then she walked away she was going directly from the station to maizie s that october betsy used to walk from the barrington hotel where she lived to catch the lexington avenue street car to work with the highest sense of jubilation she was in a new world there would never be anything again like those new york mornings before nine the sun was bright and the air was sharp brilliant and gay the people hurried along the sidewalks on the way to work in the florists shops they were setting out pots of bronze chrysanthemums there were also orchids on display crammed lavishly into glass vases but they belonged to the night world the same new york as the drawn shirred curtains in the big apartment houses where the rich women were still asleep in the mornings although sleep betsy felt as strong as ten men and her heart was as high as the air and of all the places in the world there were to be in she was glad to be here she walked with long vigorous steps on her high heels across the freshly watered streets in her new smart little tweed dresses and her little hats she knew she looked like a boy and she was glad she felt like a boy to be a young girl in new york in those days was to be like a young boy as free as unshackled as adventurous she had got a job on a fashion magazine at twenty five dollars a week she would stride in to the big office where her desk was there were about ten desks in this room some of them belonged to older women who did the work of copy reading proof correction who were constantly on the telephone to the press at the other desks sat girls like betsy young and minds quick to imitate the way things were done they worked here for small wages and were glad to get them for the experience the prestige that a job on lady gave them many of the most important women in new york had started out on lady the advertising manager of one of the biggest department stores
papa gasped orabella the room as she had promised in a flash only pausing at the door to whisper with uplifted finger and eyes dancing with as matthew assumed the excitement of conspiracy and remember i rely on you to be the soul of kindness to my poor sister pally ralph burmester entered excusing himself for his tardiness his face wore a vexed abstracted look that made matthew wonder what accounted for the delay as he glanced round the room for his wife his eyebrows rode upward of course he might have known better than trust to lydia will you drink sherry the ladies will be with us shortly one would willingly wait if need be for ever in prospect of such a treat the meaningless compliment echoing hollowly in its sober surroundings was not a success ralph s face was immovable as he crossed the room to pour out the wine it is not our custom in he said as though he rejected matthew s disclaimer looking across his shoulder matthew observed that the door through which orabella had made her escape stood slightly ajar and guessing correctlythat she was waiting behind it raised his voice to reply on the contrary i have had plenty of entertainment he paused deliberately did the door handle tremble in admiring your art collection sir is that not a guardi above the cabinet i see you are an amateur of pictures it was characteristic of matthew to present his superficial knowledge to the best advantage it was by the merest chance that he had identified the guardi among his various ventures having been that of art dealer in which he succeeded as might be said of many in the present day largely by lack of principle i know nothing of art ralph to matthew s relief returned bluntly i buy a picture when i like it school means little to me he paused as though seeking a more congenial topic of conversation and evidently did not find one for he jerked at matthew abruptly i suppose the funeral arrangements have now been made lud i suppose so rejoined matthew with the distaste he always felt for the intrusion of dull or unaesthetic topics on a social occasion grimacing at provincial boorishness he added as you may imagine i am the last to be consulted but i take it uncle jason has the matter in hand i shall ever have it on my mind said ralph heavily that i was the sun is my undoing instrumental in bringing about the death of an old friend to whom i owe more than can readily be computed you reproach yourself unduly said matthew with a curious touch of hercules dignity that was not lost on his companion if anyone is to blame it is myself af fair egad if you had to die which would you choose to flicker out mournfully like a corpse candle to the tune of prayers or to blaze to glory as grandfather did on some supreme moment of satisfaction there is no point in discussing it the thing is done and i bitterly regret my share in it be as melancholy about it as you like matthew s impatience got the better of his courtesy i too loved my grandfather and owed him certain things well i killed him if you choose to put it that way i am not one to shirk plain speaking i killed him at a moment when his life was much more valuable to me than his death that i can well believe ralph retorted icily go on believing it for if as the tale seems to go i inherit so much as a brass farthing there wo nt that t was in view of that i tumbled the old fellow into eternity he spoke brutally recklessly because he feared to be betrayed into emotion ralph shook his head if your hopes are pinned on that you would do better to relinquish them the last time i spoke to your grandfather before he had his stroke he told me all was willed to jason so much the better retorted matthew though his heart sank for i shall at least get credit for the purity of my intentions let us change the subject t is but a poor prelude to a social evening here comes my wife and my daughter orabella no schoolroom miss could have made a more demure entrance in her mother s shadow than miss orabella burmester lydia bland and mild undisturbed by her own lateness or her husband s displeasure greeted the guest with a warm simplicity you have been too long welcome you look here is little orry whom you last remember with a rattle in her hand now it is on her tongue put in ralph endeavouring to recover his tenure as a host he ruffled his daughter s curls as orabella with rashes lowered sank into her curtsy at the visitor s feet bristol save for the absence of the rattle i could have sworn t was but a minute since we met said matthew as she rose orabella glared and in passing ground down her little foot on his as hers was heelless and covered in satin he was hardly aware of the pressure but where is pally asked lydia looking about for her eldest daughter ralph flashed her a meaningful glance which she returned what have you done with pally hers said and his have patience all will be well you would like to look as matthew turned she held up toward him a purring bundle soft with sleep and fire warmth lydia had gone to ralph and wag speaking to him in a low voice i hope you like cats orabella challengedhim across the kitten s ears which he rubbed as he bent to re tort i like some the two legged sort hush here she comes there was a rich hesitant rustle of all sounds the
girl she had help it was a man what did the man look like he pursed his lips and made another steeple with his fingers he was a middle aged man heavy set about five feet seven inches tall and weighing around one hundred and seventy pounds ile said his name was smith he wore a blue suit black shoes a green tie and shirt no hat there was a brown bordered handkerchief in his outer pocket his hair was dark brown sprinkled with gray there was a bald patch about the size of a dollar on the crown of his head and a scar about two inches long running down the side of his jaw on the left side i think yes on the left side not bad i said what about the hole in his right sock i omitted to take his shoes off darn careless of you just stared at each other half curious half hostile like new neighbors then suddenly he went into his laugh again the five dollar bill i had given him was still lying on his side of the desk i flicked a hand across and took it you wo nt want this now i said since we started talking in thousands he stopped laughing very suddenly then he shrugged at eleven a m he said and no tricks mr marlowe the high window do nt think i do nt know how to protect myself i hope you do i said because what you are handling is dynamite i left him and tramped across the empty outer office and opened the door and let it shut staying inside there ought to be footsteps outside in the corridor but his transom was closed and i had nt made much noise coming on crepe rubbersoles i hoped he would remember that i the door between the door and the little closed typewriter desk a kid trick but once in a while it will work especially after a lot of smart conversation full of worldliness and sly wit like a sucker play in football and if it did nt work this time we would just be there sneering at each other again it worked nothing happened for a while except that a nose was blown then all by himself in there he went into his sick rooster laugh again then a throat was cleared then a swivel chair squeaked and feet walked a dingy white head poked into the room about two inches past the end of the door it hung there suspended and i went into a state of suspended animation then the head was drawn back and four unclean fingernails came around the edge of the door and pulled the door closed clicked was shut i started breathing again and put my ear to the wooden panel the swivel telephone being dialed i lunged across to the instrumenton the little typewriter desk and lifted it at the other end of the line the bell had started to ring it rang six times then a man s voice said yeah the florence aparments yeah the high window i d like to speak to mr anson in apartment two o four hold the wire i ll see if he s in mr morningstar and i held the wire noise came over it the blaring sound of a loud radio broadcasting a baseball game it was not close to the telephone but it was noisy enough then i could hear the hollow sound of steps coming nearer and the harsh rattle of the telephone receiver being picked up and the voice said not in any message i ll call later mr morningstar said i hung up fast and did a rapid glide across the floor to the entrance door and let it close the same way taking its weight at the last moment so that the click of the catch would not have been heard three feet away i breathed hard and tight going down the hall listening to myself i pushed the elevator button then i got out the card which mr george anson phillips had given me in the lobby of the hotel metropole i did nt look at it in any real sense i did nt have to look at it to recall that it referred to apartment florence apartments court street i just stood there flicking it with a fingernail while the old elevator came heaving up in the shaft straining like a gravel truck on a hairpin turn the time was three fifty bunker hill is old town lost town shabby town crook town once very long ago it was the choice residential district of the city and there are still standing a few of the jigsaw the high window gothic mansions with wide porches windows with spindle turrets they are all rooming houses now their parquetry floors are scratched and worn through the once glossy finish and the wide sweeping staircases are dark with time and with cheap varnish laid on over generations of dirt in the tall rooms haggard landladies bicker with shifty tenants on the wide cool front porches reaching their cracked shoes into the sun and staring at nothing sit the old men with faces like lost battles in and around the old houses there are flyblown restaurantsand italian fruitstands and cheap apartment houses and little candy stores where you can buy even nastier things than their candy and there are ratty hotels where nobody except people named smith and jones sign the register and where the night clerk is half watchdog and half pander out of the apartment houses come women who should be young but have faces like stale beer men with pulled down hats and quick eyes that look the street over behind the cupped hand that shields the match flame worn intellectuals with cigarette coughs and no and unwavering eyes cokies and coke peddlers people who look like nothing in particular and know it
waiting it struck mary as queer that he should have stayed in here when the others had all met her outside she ran over and kissed him on the cheek and held him by the shoulders laughing and saying let me look at you you spalpeen edgar did not laugh so heartily as paul he gave mary a hug but when she looked eagerly at his face it was so good to see him again he dropped his eyes in a strange way and turned a little aside mary paused troubled and a little hurt was edgar not glad to see her eddie she remembered now the queer reserve he had shown the time she came home from london the last time she had ever really talked to him she looked at paul as if to ask silently what was the trouble but there was nothing to be learned from the remote look in his face edgar apparently did things like this all the time now and he looked so strange and pale and nervous mary turned hack to the others a little sadly edgar was a man now a man goodness she thought of twenty five you could not treat him like a boy the pattern of the carpet the slanting rays of the afternoon sun in clarissa s old bay window garden roused the ancient memory of that first day when she had stood trembling before her new employer here they were in the back parlor again she and paul and edgar and in some unbelievableway paul s wife and son william scott should be here and his distant elder son mary stood and looked slowly about the room in one glance she was renewing her profound intimacy with it and also observing its state of neglect from the smudges on the windows to the worn edges of the upholstery the limp sparse leaves of the dejected plants the grimy woodwork the filmy unkept look of the fireplace tiles the place was eloquent of everything that had happened to the family now the troubled present swept down to blot the memories from mary s mind she looked about and saw her work cut out louise was speaking mother scott will be so glad to see you mary i ll go right up her own words echoed in mary s mind as she ran up the stairs she might have asked to go to clarissa and instead she had pronounced her intention of doing so it was a trifle a passing unnoticed exchange of words but mary knew approaching clarissa s door that it situation was to mean she was in his words the boss she would not ask permissions in this house she would make decisions she looked at paul as they entered his mother s room and marvelled that fate had twisted all their lives into this tangle clarissa lay in bed her pain racked eyes shining with happiness at sight of mary she stretched out her bony hand and drew mary close for an eloquent kiss dear child she said slowly mary was prepared for the shock of the changes in clarissa and did not show by a flick of her eye the sorrow and the pity that throbbed inside her clarissa was so faded she had never been a woman of brilliant coloring or striking contours but now her blond hair had turned colorless rather than gray and her blue eyes had lost their hue she had a ghostlike quality which mary had never seen in anyone before clarissa scott was a tall woman and her figure in years past could see the flesh was rapidly melt ing away and the outline of her body beneath the bedclothes was bony rather than full and rounded as it used to be her voice had a hesitant almost a strangled quality as if she feared to start speaking lest a paroxysm of pain interrupt her and silence her but mary did not show a sign of perceiving all this she drew up a hassock close to the bed and perched on it holding clarissa s hand and talking softly and happily you re not to worry about a thing in the world mrs scott she said we ll all make out beautifully here together louise murmured clarissa her heavy eyes followed paul as he tiptoedquietly from the room to leave his mother alone with mary can you manage all that of course they looked at each other silently then mary said please do nt worry about that mrs scott i m him to marry her long ago do nt you re member clarissa nodded i would nt have come back if i had nt felt everything had turned out for the best and i m really happy truly i am clarissa pressed mary s hand you re a dear girl i m so awfully glad to be near you again mary stopped speaking as a change began to come over clarissa s lethargic features the bony hand in hers closed suddenly in a fierce involuntary clutch the dry lips set in a grim ghastly line the leaden eyes sunken deep beneath their lids a moment before opened violently and stared with horrible eloquence from the agonized face beads of dampness sprang out on the putty colored forehead mary leaned forward mastering her impulse to cringe at this fearful sight and gripped clarissa s hands hard looking deep into her eyes even in the throes of mortal agony clarissa conveyed her relief her she need not dissemble mary saw all in a moment what a frightful burden of self imposed discipline this strong woman had added to the torture that had been her fate mary held her breath and did not move while the paroxysmwas violent clarissa sagged suddenly from the galvanic stiffness with which she had met the assault her eyes indicated a vial of medicine on the table by the bed two she gasped through her
nt we michael yes said michael he was shocked and surprised victoria remembered hollis at the telephone the way he sagged against the wall when the police described the woman they had found in the river yes said bessie but he did nt tell me he did nt want to alarm me and we we d had words about the girl you see he did nt she swallowed convulsively he did nt want to give her up yet he was nt really in love with her you see oh mother do nt said hollis he turned brusquely away walked over to the window and said over his shoulder tell the truth it was murder and i i did nt want to be mixed up in it i it was an impulse and i looked at joan there in that beastly little room and i i could nt say yes i knew her i did nt even tell mother until after joan was was identified i could nt he stopped the room was very still for a moment then he know it and a coward all right but i did nt kill her bessie did nt move only her great ringed eyes followed hollis and her hands twisted victoria started toward hollis realized that sympathy would be another drop of humiliation and stopped major campbell said to bessie did you recognize the girl her great eyes flashed no certainly not did you ever talk to her over the telephone i mean no she said violently a woman did telephone to her said beasley mrs isham why did you want your son to stop seeing her because she because i did there must have been some important reason did she know anything about henry frame s murder hollis turned around of course not she knew nothing of it how could she bessie said heavily i did nt want hollis to to marry victoria there s the business you see hollis could manage it she glanced at victoria you must have known that my dear she said breezily never really wanted you to marry michael she glanced at michael too gave him a queerly polite and too long and added not that i object to you michael i just did nt want her to marry anyone but hollis michael looking a little amused said as politely as bessie i quite understand but aunt bessie began victoria and stopped with a feeling of helplessness hollis said over his shoulder victoria does nt care a hang for me mike there never was anything between us it s just an idea of mother s beasley said his voice still purring but mrs isham miss steane is to marry bayne she would have been married to him now quality of softness except for the fact that joan green and miss forbes were murdered bessie blinked and said violently i did nt kill either of them to stop victoria s marriage if that s what you mean major campbell came forward mrs isham had joan green ever come to the house before he asked hollis replied no never yet she did manage to find her way from the corner where she got off the bus through the grounds to the pine woods hollis shrugged how did she get there do you think how should i know i did nt meet her but she must have met someone do you know who certainly not said hollis unless unless what well said hollis there s this maid that was wandering around oh you re going to make the most of her are nt you it could have been a man said hollis that s all i m told said john campbell that miss green was very good at her job did you think so isham hollis looked at him suspiciously why i do nt know how should i know ask the officers she worked for she did have a very retentive memory had nt she i do nt know said hollis sulkily did she ever talk of colonel galant or or anything at all to do with affairs in the office hollis whirled around his face was red again and his light eyes were snapping listen he said colonel galant called me into his office late this afternoon we ve had all this out did nt he tell you or i see question me too well listen i did nt sell any military information hollis cried his mother you oh be still mother i did nt sell any information i did nt know anything to sell and i would nt have known where to sell it if i had known anything and i would nt have done it anyway so that s that there was a long silence then beasley said softly well let s just go over all this again an hour later he let them go without so far as victoria could see adding a scrap to his stock of information except the fact that bessie had told clistie about joan green so clistie forbes knew the girl he cried in triumph certainly not said bessie she d never seen her she only knew of her her name and where she worked and how hollis had to telephone to the girl you told her to get the girl here then you got rid of both of them beasley s method of questioning was almost entirely accusation bessie turned purple i did not she shouted in the end both hollis and bessie stuck to the explanation they had given him and when they d gone he turned all his guns upon victoria michael would have stayed but beasley made him leave we ll come to you again later he said with a little smile on his wide purplish lips just now i want to talk to miss steane so michael had to go and then with the heavy oak door closed the light from above pouring down the thick
go and then elizabeth would offer him everything she had she was too loyal and she loved him too much to dream of doing otherwise she would work and use everything she could earn for his support she would spend her life nursing him amusing him taking care of him himself a broken wreck of a creature who could give her nothing in return except a doglike gratitude her splendid vitality would be spent in a twilight of half living until she was dry and withered like fruit that had been broken off the tree before it had had a chance to ripen as he thought of it he knew more and more surely that no matter what would become of him he could not let this happen to her his decision was not entirely unselfish arthur was too clearheaded to imagine it was not only could he not do this to elizabeth but he could not do it to himself to share it he knew almost as if he were with her what she would suffer at being told of his death but that would not last forever though at the time she would undoubtedly think it was going to she would pick up the broken pattern of her life and set about putting it together again elizabeth was young vital alert and there would be another man who would find her as lovable as he had found her she would have again the sort of mating she should have he tried instinctively to clench his list with decision and the pain that went like a bayonet thrust into his shoulder reminding him that he was not even able to make such a simple gesture served to strengthen his resolve when a man dies he told himself with more fierceness in his mind since there could be none in his body it is like taking a teaspoonful of water out of a river the water closes up it is gone when jacoby came in again arthur told him what he had decided to do he had to speak slowly repeating often and waiting until jacoby s intelligence had limped through to comprehension the effort to make jacoby understand took his attentionaway from the bleak import of what he was saying i will make you a promise jacoby if you will do one thing for me do it and come back and tell me you have done it i understand you go ahead when i was brought in here you found the metal tag of identification and other things maybe take those to the international red cross tell them your stretcher bearers brought in an american who died of his wounds you do not know his name but you took these objects from his body you will sign a death certificate or whatever you have to sign the american army will take care of the rest if you will do this and bring me i promise you that i will let you do whatever you please to me but if you will not do it i swear to you that i ll make you do it because i ll end my life as soon as i have a usable hand to do it with deliberately further to relieve his attention he fixed his eyes on jacoby s eyes tender as the eyes of a mother on jacoby strong wise gentle face and while he repeated his sentence she noticed again what a thin face it was the skin showing the waxiness of malnutrition and guessed as he had guessed before that this man was denying himself part of his own rations to provide more nourishment for the men he was trying to save at last he said slowly and carefully you understand me you will do what i ask jacoby jacoby nodded while he sought for his answer his right hand covered the right hand that could not yet be clenched friendly across the wall i will do that it was all he could say but by that time they had learned to do a good deal of communicating without language jacoby did not have a wife of his own until now his life had been too full of work and war to give him much chance to think of personal happiness later he was to find out what it meant to have a woman s suffering mean more to him than his own but he did not hesitate before arthur s request arthur continued you will not communicate with my wife you will not try to find her i understand what you are saying i will not try to find her she will marry again arthur said another man will love her she will have children she will be happy do you get it jacoby she s a splendid woman i m going to get out of her way oh you do nt get i m right jacoby tried to answer you are he hesitated reaching into his pocket for the dictionary he always carried now you are most completely right kitt he looked down at the bundle of bandages before him and added i do under stand you arthur s voice broke in a sob and the sob came from so deep that it sent points of pain through him and he had to wait till they subsided before he could go on you do nt understand you never loved a woman again the sob rushed up and again he had to wait till the pain of it went down you never loved a woman he said enough to die for her whether the barrier was language or experience this time jacoby did not try to answer but he went and did what arthur had asked him to do jacoby used one of the precious night hours up a sort of shelf across arthur s cot and set the dictionary up on it my english is so faulty
poor family there is too many children on this earth already and no room for the weak ones do nt say that katie held her baby tightly it s not better to die who wants to die everything struggles to live look at that tree growing up there out of that grating it gets no sun and water only when it rains it s growing out of sour earth and it s strong because its hard struggle to live is making it strong my children will be strong that way aw somebody ought to cut that tree down the homely thing if there was only one tree like that in the world you would think it was beautiful said katie but because there are so many you just ca nt see how beautiful it really is look at those children she pointed to a swarm of dirty children playing in the gutter you could dress him up and sit him in a fine house and you would think he was beautiful you ve got fine ideas but a very sick baby katie they told her book two this baby will live said katie fiercely i ll make it live and francie lived choking and whimpering her way through that first year francie s brother was born a week after her first birthday this time katie was not working when the pains came this time she bit her lip and did not scream out in her agony helpless in her pain she was capable still of laying the foundation for bitterness and capability when the strong healthy boy howling at the indignity of the birth process was put to her breast she felt a wild tenderness for him the other baby francie in the crib next her bed began to whimper katie had a flash of contempt for the weak child she had borne a year son she was quickly ashamed of her contempt she knew it was nt the little girl s fault i must watch myself carefully she thought i am going to love this boy more than the girl but i must nt ever let her know it is wrong to love one child more than the other but this is something that i can not help sissy begged her to call the boy after johnny but katie insisted that the boy had a right to a name all his own sissy got very angry and told katie a thing or two finally katie more in anger than in truth accused sissy of being in love with johnny sissy answered maybe and katie shut up she was a little afraid that if they quarreled further she would find out that it was so about sissy loving johnny katie called the boy cornelius after a noble character she had seen a handsome actor represent on the stage as the boy grew was known as neeley without devious reasoning or complicated emotional processes the boy became katie s whole world johnny took second place and francie went to the back of her mother s heart katie loved the boy because he was more completely hers than either johnny or francie neeley looked exactly like johnny katie would make him into the kind of man johnny should have been he would have everything that was good about johnny she would encourage that she would stamp out all of the things that were bad about johnny as they came up in the boy neeley he would grow up and she would be proud of him and he would take care of her all of her days he was the one that she had to see through francie and johnny would get by some a tree grows in brooklynhow but she would take no chances with the boy she d see to it that he more than got by gradually as the children grew up katie lost all character she became capable hard and far seeing she loved johnny dearly but all the old wild worship faded away she loved her little girl because she felt sorry for her it was pity and obligation towards her that she felt rather than love johnny and francie felt the growing change in katie as the boy grew stronger and handsomer johnny grew in weakness and went further and further down hill francie felt the way her mother thought about her she grew an answering hardness against her mother and this hardness paradoxically enough brought them a little closer together because it made them more alike by the time neeley was a year old katie had stopped depending on johnny johnny was drinking heavily he worked when he was offered one night jobs he brought home his wages but kept his tips for liquor life was going too swiftly for johnny he had a wife and two babies before he was old enough to vote his life was finished before it had a chance it better than johnny nolan katie had the same hardships as johnny and she was nineteen two years younger it might be said that she too was doomed her life too was over before it began but there the similarity ended johnny knew he was doomed and accepted it katie would nt accept it she started a new life where her old one left off she exchanged her tenderness for capability she gave up her dreams and took over hard realities in their place katie had a fierce desire for survival which made her a fighter johnny had a hankering after immortality which made him a useless dreamer and that was the great difference between these two who loved each other so well johnny celebrated his voting birthday by getting drunk for three days when he was coming out of it katie locked him in the bedroom where he could nt get anything more to drink instead of sobering up he started to get delirium tremens he wept and was suffering she
compara tively safe route to california which he had just established when senatorbenton presented the map to the senate he delivered a eulogy on colonel fremont which made jessie sitting in her accustomed seat in the gallery swell with pride in the middle of february some twenty one months after john had left washington she wrote a letter to her cousin sarah brant in it she tried to explain the innumerable devices fill ins and fortitudes which she had used to somehow pass the time explaining also the sense of being only fractionally alive when one can not hear the voice of a loved one touch his hand sec a look of understanding flash into his eyes she ended on a cheerful note which looked toward the future i feel that the honor to colonel fremont is but honor due for the arduouslabors he has performed and for his conspicuous bravery and it is little enough reward for his difficult indeed dear cousin for me to express my own happiness its warmth and light have driven all the chill and dark foreboding from my heart my happiness gives me renewed strength and patience exactly a week later when she was working at her desk in her sitting room josheem brought in a page from the state department with a packet of spanish letters if you will return at five this afternoon she told the page i will have the material ready for you she was skimming a long letter from monterey which dealt largely with land grants when she suddenly sat bolt upright in her chair the letter told of a quarrel which had arisen between commodore stockton of the navy and general kearny of the army over the command and control of california the letter ended with a sentence which the writer included as of only mild interest colonel fremont has been removed as commandant of california she waited with impatience until senator benton returned at four o clock him he would be as dumbfounded as she had been instead she saw her father flush his eyes become watery in a terrifying moment she thought he knows about this then it must be worse than it appears in this dispatch after a moment he said i heard of it in st louis when i was there last month why did nt you tell me i had hoped the trouble would blow over jessie i had hoped that it was just a passing quarrel between general kearny and commodore stockton has it blown over no she began pacing the room nervously but what could possibly have happened according to the reports john was doing a good job as governor why did they suddenly become dissatisfied it was not a question of his performance your husband got himself caught in a contest between the army and navy for authority over california commodore stockton had orders to take and when the mexicans surrendered commodore stockton appointed colonel fremont as the governor but general kearny also had orders from washington to assume the governorship of california should he conquer and take possession of the country but would nt commodore stockton s orders be considered the valid ones since the fighting was practically over by the time general kearny got there kearny fought one battle a battle which he lost by the way however the problem revolves about the question of who had the latest orders from washington kearny or stockton who did we re not certain yet in any event general kearny demanded that colonel fremont acknowledge him to be the commander in chief of california john and his men were still serving under stockton as part of the navy and so he declined to acknowledge kearny s authority kearny then moved his headquarters to monterey where he set up a civil government and declared colonel fremont to be deposed as governor with no further authority to this squabble she asked with a heavy heart the army and navy belong to the same government do nt they once again her father s manner was evasive he had been honest with his daughter for so many years that he found the transition difficult i have already spoken to the president yes he wants the men in california to settle this dispute among them selves do you think they will there is certainly nothing in the argument that ca nt be settled her peace shattered jessie impatiently edged through the weeks that followed waiting for some word of how her husband was faring in the conflict her only momentary diversion was eliza s marriage eliza had been so helpful during her own troubled courtship that she was happy to be able to stage a beautiful wedding for her older sister in the drawing room of the benton home eliza wanted the affair to be a quiet one but before of necessity invite some two hundred people the dinner which followed the ceremony was elaborate for jessie tried to duplicate for her sister the magnificent wedding dinner served at cherry grove the preparations the excitement the visits to the dressmaker the planning of the ceremony and dinner occupied her time for almost three weeks she was glad to be so exhausted by the end of the day that she could fall into a troubled sleep she saw her sister and new brother in law off for a trip to new york then bade good by to her father who was going to st louis on political business at the front door he said to her be of good courage and take care of your health i ll do my best father but it is this groping in the dark that has upset me if only i could know what is going on out there thomas benton had a saying that good news travels on the swiftest horse but bad news before the almost comfortable silence surrounding the events in california was split open her cousin sarah
if they do stop ut of fear or whatever they go at once into such a state of euphoria and well being that they become over confident they re rid of drink and feel sure enough of themselves to be able to start again promising they ll take one or at the most two and well then it becomes the same old story all over do nt realize it because liquor does nt mean to us what it does to them the doctor turned to don why do nt you go home you can you know i m waiting for my hat the men glanced at each other and laughed and then moved off he could have kicked himself for saying that it made him somehow so utterly ludicrous and laughable that he was ashamed for the first time that morning oh christ what difference did it make nobody knew he was here and nobody here knew or cared who he was but he was ashamed all the same he got up and stepped to the small barred window near the end of his bed he looked out and down cars and busses were going by people moved along the sidewalk who of those down there knew who was up here what was going on in this room what was going on inside the men in this street past this very building where he stood looking down and never even looked at the place never dreamed that one day never dreamed it because those things just did nt happen not to the kind of person he was the kind of people he knew they say you did nt have a hat he turned and there was bim you were nt wearing one when you came in they say i was nt that s what they tell me baby he moved away from the wall surprisingly he walked well enough he felt weak but not too unsteady the paraldehyde still held if that s what it was that was doing it it had to hold till he got home will you show me now how to get out okay let me take your arm i do nt need it thanks they started down the ward meet the derisive yearning or fearful glances he felt from all sides you ve got to stop at the desk and sign something what a paper you release the hospital from all responsibility that s because you would nt take the treatment in the hall a nurse handed up a printed form and a pen without looking up from her work in front of her on the desk was a large open jar half full of thick white wafers probably the salt tablets they had been talking about right here baby bim pointed his finger at the place t o sign don took the pen his mind went back to the mornings at juan les pins the agonizing mornings at the bank when often he tent more than an hour trying to control the shaking of his hand before he could bring himself to attempt the signature on the letter of credit under the eyes of the watching teller he would drop out of line again and again sit outdoors to stare at the incredible blue of the sea and take deep breaths and try to calm himself by forgetting the money he needed the pen the necessary signature and the impassive teller and when he had recovered enough to join the line again the whole unnerving helpless performance would he repeated but now to his surprise probably to bim s too the hand wrote his name plainly and well paraldehyde he must hang onto it never never forget it i ll take you to the elevator baby the walk through the hall and the waiting were a more trying ordeal than he could have anticipated they went along the corridor in silence till the nurse stopped and pushed a button in the wall then he leaned against the wall and looked at don never had he felt so much on trial in his life on trial for what he did nt know he went hot with exasperation and embarrassment as he felt the nurse s eyes looking him where to fix his own gaze he waited in a foolish suspense unreasonable outlandish bizarre in all his life there was no precedent of behavior for such a moment i f that guy so much as spoke to him uttered a word of advice told him to take it easy he felt the odd smile and fought to resist but it was no use he could nt help himself any longer involuntarily he raised his eyes and looked back listen baby the voice was so low and soft he could scarcely hear it i know you the elevator doors slid open he saw the brightly lighted car and the sudden response on the faces of the passengers the broken blood vessels the violent discoloration he stepped in and quickly turned his back through the small glass window of the door he saw the nurse s eyebrows raised in farewell and the floor gave way beneath his feet as he came out into ambulance turned in at the gate dang dang too long he walked on to a bus stop at the corner reached into his vest pocket for one of the four nickels and stepped into a bus he went to the far end of the bus and sat down on the rear seat but he might just as well have stayed up front the passengers turned and continually turned to look at him the driver bent his head slightly to see him in the mirror he sa back erect and gazed absently out of the window trying to show by his indifference that he had never worn a hat in his life though a hat at this moment was what he longed for more than almost
felt used up he stood with his arm around rachel and he listened to brother peter s voice that voice which had been with him all his life that sure confident resonant voice jeff had picked for his home a small plot of land near the schoolhouse a piece that was owned by the people in community they had set this section aside for a school and a cemetery and as jeff said lightly it might well do for him to be near both gideon arranged for the building they were old hands at it by now the timber was their own two by fours sweet smelling pine siding three quarter inch plank for the flooring dovetail oak to do the inside properly all of hannibal washington a fine bricklayer set in the hearths and chimneys jeff spent hours drawing plans a sunlit examination room a space for two beds a large section that would someday be an operating room he said to gideon finally it comes out the largest house at carwell which is fitting gideon agreed where will the money come from i have enough money for that i think gideon smiled i ca nt take any more from you i ve been taking all these years i would nt worry about it jeff you ll want equipment wo nt you furniture beds other things they cost a lot we ll manage i suppose you could find some of it in columbia but i think we d do better in charleston we ll go there soon he had other reasons for wanting to go to charleston but them he and jeff could go together for the time being jeff and ellen lived with gideon there was a deep trust and close communion between ellen and rachel something gideon did not share once jeff said to his father do you hold it against me my marrying ellen a man should marry the woman he loves gideon replied and he tried to tell that to himself to make himself believe that along with many other things as he realized later much of the world he lived in that march of was a fool s world for gideon jackson to believe that the sun stood still and that time stood still was strange stranger even than that was the fact that he had so much real happiness in those few weeks happiness married by many small things but real happiness for the first time in almost a decade gideon laid aside his books he did nt want to read to study to the increasing number of patients he spent the whole of every day working with marcus for people so far apart so different in basic matters he and marcus understood each other well marcus lacked the driving pain that was a part of gideon and jeff for them there was the whole of the puzzling world for marcus the world was constrained and understandable and in a sense more complete marcus was a sinner brother peter admitted that sadly yet comprehendingly marcus loved the fact of women body breast and thigh without shame yet without lust and animal health and freedom filled him like a cup brimming over with life liquid small and slim as he was he could outwork gideon he drank with the white men the way they drank matching leslie carson s son joe drink for drink down a half gallon jug of raw corn he loved to dance his accordion made the old music new all the old swamp songs the tired his fingers they became something new he gave them new rhythms new life he worshipped gideon he knew cotton but gideon knew it better he knew the soil and bowed to gideon there they worked at the forge in the barn and put a new tire on a cartwheel stripped to the waist gideon drove his hammer like a smith forty five years had nt taken the strength out of his arms and as the hammer came down again and again it filled the world with its sound mark it the boy sang turning the iron mark it mark it mark it and gideon piled on sweat streaming down his face they shifted all the remaining fodder into a new bin working together in smooth rhythm with their forks singing together i got a crick in my back i m old and tired they cleared swamp growth for planting swinging two edged axes in short stinging blows and came tramping but delighted with themselves jeff told gideon at your age that is nt the wisest thing at my age gideon smiled it s not as if you did it all the time when you live a sedentary life most of the year gideon and marcus took a day off hunting gideon with a rifle in hope of raising a deer marcus with a shotgun saying he would be satisfied with rabbits they whistled their two speckled pointers filled their pockets with bread and set off across the fields one cold crisp morning they sang their own song softly and happily daddy went a hunting lord lord lord yes daddy went a hunting lord lord lord the dogs fanned out and cut back and forth across the meadows the two men did nt talk much somehow it never mattered that gideon and marcus had so little to say to each other they fitted not hide nor hair of a deer had gideon seen but marcus s pouch held a brace of fat rabbits he took them to the barn to skin and dress them and give the dogs their reward of the gizzards gideon went to the house jeff was waiting for him his face like a piece of granite his eyes hard the way gideon had never seen them before he led his father into the parlor abner lait sat there his big red hands tight on his knees what is it gideon wanted
of the first war party but south boy knew that mojave ritual was so bound down to the tradition of the first times that the actual procedure of yellow road s party would nt have varied greatly from that set down in the flying overhead that heralded the party s return how the people shouted when they saw it how they sent four alyah men who dressed and behaved like women to meet the warriors and aid the unclean trophy bearer on whose pole the long hair of the head skins waved and danced in the summer wind how a hota came forth and invited all the warriors to a dance and a feast and how he likewise offered a small house and a patch of garden to the captive slaves these girls lived a strange life thereafter technically they were the slaves of the host who took charge of them but he never made them work nor did he go near them or have anything to do with them except to see that they did nt run away they were treated much like animals in a zoo mojaves came from long distances to watch these foreign women often tossing them bundles of food if they got tired of being on exhibition they could ask the hota to take them to the river and not tried to run away for a long time he would do it then they would be considered mojaves and could live with any man who wanted them but even then they usually died virgins because all the men were afraid of them pin the nichiva singing there were many verses about the status of slave girls then it described the pole with the head skins standing in the ground in the middle of the dancing place i low the men and women danced around it their faces painted black and yellow their hair stiff with white clay and alkali dancing in many groups each in a different manner according to which cycle of dream singing its leader sang some clapped hands some shook rattles some danced to drumbeats made on a basket or a water jar all this was in the nichiva singing nr great detail when the old indian stopped he was very tired and it was hard for him to get his breath when he did he said there now i am weak because i have not eaten for a long time i need big meat and there is hume here i t occurred to south boy that the old man might actually be starving still grumbling about big meat yellow road drank some f the water and chewed a little of the bean fiber with his few limit teeth and spat it out with a grimace then he began the story of the first defeat the mojaves suffered in tribal history gain a yuma traveler had been murdered and again the tilers had been a kindred tribe this time the maricopa over the salt river valley with the maricopa lived the remnant f the colorado river tribes that the mojave and the yuma d ruined in war and driven east across the desert some of c e had killed the lone yuma the yuma always a small tribe sent eighty two clubbers t a punitive expedition the mojave sent two hundred and they were joined by a hundred yavapai and i he maricopa knew they were coming and called on their friends the pima who were club fighters like the mojave and very numerous people they sent the maricopa four hundred men who fought in solid phalanx behind big bullhide shields the apache horsemen charged first and fought like lions for about five minutes having several horses killed and many men wounded but when they found the pima maricopa line would not break they fled the yavapai charged with the apache being half mojave and half apache they fought for a longer time and lost ten men before they ran the mojave and the yuma being on foot struck next they broke the line of pima shields again and again killing a hundred men but the pima always re formed no other alien people had ever done that before in the history of mojave warfare then said yellow road i called to the yuma i said they are too many and we are too far from our own two they had thrust themselves into the midst of the pima and killed until they died nobody else fought like that but our people and the pima the mojave lost forty men killed and there was not a man among them but carried some wound the defeated mojave retreated for eight days through yavapai country and through the land of the walapai the walapai stood on their hills and jeered at them and the mojaves too wounded and weary to punish them went home to sulk and brood this was in the spring of out of this jeering a greater evil was to befall in august of that year a large immigrant train the first contingent of iowans to migrate to southern california came down lieutenant beale s new trail through north central arizona and when they were camped at the river crossing where fort mojave now stands the walapai came and again taunted the mojave and dared them to attack the whites and the mojaves still brooding over their defeat hundred head of cattle driving the emigrantsback the way they had come and no others ever came down that trail thus the mojaves gained back their prestige for a little while then the soldiers came the first hostile invasion of the mojave valley yellow road said nothing of how the rifle fire of the soldiers mowed down the ranks of the mojave clubbers he ended his story cursing the walapai naming their dead grandfathers he closed his eyes he said i am weak my shadow is weak i need meat by and by
before atlanta or at peach tree creek a young aide of sherman s rushed up to the general saluted and said general sherman sir two journalists have been killed in the action on our left clint who was standing near knew how the have news from hell before breakfast eh general sherman laughed clint told the story that night in sherman s presence to sherman s staff putting the remark in the general s mouth after that it got down to the privates and sherman heard news from hell before breakfast so much that he came to believe that he had said it but what was more important that remark got clint into the general s dispatches it no doubt got clint the call to speak to the new england society and to the reunion of the army of tennessee after the war where the idea of clint this old friend who had sent him a box of havanas as a cabinet member must have entered the back of grant s head but wagnal said i do nt believe i saw much of clint in georgia i spent most of my free time up to the battle of atlanta with rome and if i ever saw a man gaunt down and sadden it boy that this was his second war and that he had had a youth of strife and hardship and i think that his family back in iowa had been forced to open a dressmaker s shop to help pay the taxes and keep themselves though he sent them nearly all his captain s pay when he got it i believe that one worsham jones whom he had left in charge of his livery stable was stealing the receipts and running mrs hanks into debt besides these anxieties he had one of the worst cases of dysentery i ever treated and the general tone of his health was low so i saw him sadden on the march through georgia oh he did nt give up do nt ever believe sir that it was in rome to give up but the sadness grew deeper in him one day he said to me at peach tree creek i think thomas the boy without the teeth came to me today and told me clint the boy thought it was only one shot he said it looked as if the muzzle was pointed his way and he sure heard the bullet whine do you think clint is doing these things can it be that bates and that lad are touched well rome i said what do you think of it you pulled clint and bates out of the mud at pittsburgh landing and toothless too yes rome said but that might happen to anybody the battle of atlanta gave clint belton a fine total on the profit side of his ledger his courage was high he must have felt the luck in him that day i am riding the crest he said to himself you know how that is in a game of ball or cricket or tennis there are days when you are in fine form and fettle when you wallop the ball you feel the good impact and you know as you swing and hit that this is a good shot made him hump to no avail not that it was such a victory for the union it was a bad fight for us a terrible fight but for clint it was a personal victory we were on the left behind some light works we had thrown up the night before they opened with cannon about noon and pretty soon they were around behind us yelling that high rebel screech and coming on like a bat out of hell oh well wagnal said it seemed so perhaps they did nt really for they were nearly all tired and hungry and a good many of them were boys and old men why i collared a boy who had his ma s butcher knife lashed to the end of a broom handle he tried to stick it in me but it hit my belt buckle and besides it was dull as butter and he was too weak he cried with rage when i took the broomstick away from him and made him go behind our lines he ma with a shell i ought to have been with the wounded all the time but i itched then to get out in front and get myself shot that was how i happened to see clint on foot running up and down the lines behind the works hollering for everybody to hold hard and give em hell he had his colt s revolver in one hand and his sword in the other and we ll give the devil his due he had the eye of mars and the beard of zeus that day all right he had on his buck gauntlets and he was as dusty and dirty as all the actors who played the part of the dusty courier in all the melodramas about the war between the states in little tank towns for years afterward once or twice i saw him wave his sword and take a shot at the rebels over our heads sleepy bates and the toothless boy were near me and i saw sleepy turn his head to look over his shoulder with was shouting and firing his pistol i could see it kick in his hand rome was standing beside toothless taking aim with a musket he had picked up when toothless started beating him on the shoulder and pointing first to bates who was lying belly down with his face in the redclay parapet of the works and then to clint who was firing over our heads again i saw rome frown vexedly try to hear what toothless had to say and turn away to aim the musket again i saw a red spot come up on bates

hardships and the dangers he and ellen endured together for of course it really was dangerous he explained things might have gone badly wrong and he concluded something happened to me on the way down the canyon i had liked ellen before that and yet i had felt a certain antagonism toward her too for no reason except that i was at leave her to heaven i leave her to heaven i was a confirmed old bachelor and bachelors always shy off from any sort of matrimonial pitfall but before we came to the end of our journey it seemed to me that she and i were in all the ways that mattered already married and that she was the bravest and finest and altogether the most desirable woman in the world the same way about me maybe it s a conceited thing to say danny but i think she s quite as much in love with me as i am with her for instance my idea would have been to wait till you could be at our wed ding but she does nt want to wait to wait would mean her going back to boston and my going back to you and our not seeing each other for weeks or months but she s anxious to come with me and to know you and i m anxious for you to know her and neither of us wanted to wait we ll be married here tomorrow morning and glen robie is lending us a car and we ll drive away somewhere for a day or two and then start to come to you be ready with a big welcome for us danny i want you to be as happy as i am it will be three of us instead of only two from fine we both send love and well see you soon dick danny read that letter slowly devouring every word and he grinned at dick s happiness and he thought dick sounded different already younger gay and merry and more like a boy than a man there were two or three passages which to his sharpened and sensitive mind seemed a little as though dick were trying to reassure himself but danny decided that was just his imagination certainly dick would not have married anyone unless he wanted to very much indeed so ellen was bound to be all right he told the nurses and the doctors joyfully the news lis ten is nt this wonderful dick s married to a girl out there they re coming right on here he even read them parts of dick s letter telling who she was and what she was like telling the story of the adventure in the canyon but he saw their ex change what they were thinking because of course they knew how much dick meant to him so to make them see that he did not feel badly he put on an excessive enthusiasm insisting over and over on his delight but when he was left alone his eyes shadowed with doubts would dick love him as much as ever come to see him as often stay as long would she like him or would she resent dick s devotion to him after all you could nt blame her for not wanting dick tied down forced to stay near a sick crippled bedridden boy who could nt do anything who could never do anything again except perhaps lurch around on crutches and sit in a wheel chair and of course swim it was only his legs that were useless and when he was a little stronger lie would be able to swim with his arms and they said he could even use his legs in swimming too but all and dick said she was pretty and probably she liked good times parties and dances and fishing trips and travelling and naturally she would nt ever love him as dick did maybe dick would leave him here among strangers who were as nice as they could be of course and take her home to boston take her next summer to back of the moon take her fishing at anticosti take her with him to all the places to which he and danny had planned to go that would be pretty terrible but he must nt let them know he minded just because he was crippled that did nt mean he had any right to boss their two lives he would send them away to have their good times together just as he had sent dick away this summer only perhaps when he was stronger he could sometimes go with them and not be too much of a bother he would be able to walk on crutches by then and perhaps after you did nt have to be able to walk to write books during the next two or three days danny convinced himself that he could avoid hindering their happiness no one wanted an invalid hung around his neck all the time and he certainly did nt want to be a burden to them they would be happy and so would he leave her to heaven one evening a telegram announced they would arrive next day as long as the hour of their coming had been uncertain danny had been able to think pretty clearly and to plan how gladly he would greet them so that not even dick should guess the terror he had felt but now in the imminence of their arrival he was just plain scared again if she were the sort of girl some men thought beautiful all made up with red fingernails and a red mouth it would be pretty awful during the daylight hours before they came he lay still trembling terribly perspiring cold with lonely heard dick s voice along the corridor heard them coming nearer and nearer his door he shut his eyes tight dreadfully afraid that he was going
though it was nt my party garback mused ellery was nt there a garback myron myron garback was a witness in the haight case owns the prosecuted fox tom s older brother incidentally myron does nt own the high village pharmacy any more he dropped dead of heart disease late in or was it and his widow sold out to alvin cain and moved to california alvin cain the name struck a soft pedal cain then ellery remembered the look on davy fox s face in the queen living room in new york oh yes well mr hendrix it may be necessary for me to talk to tom garback where can i find him ask the white house grinned prosecutor hendrix tom was called to washington years ago confidential work on pennsylvania avenue last i heard he was off somewhere on a mission for the president he might be in paris or moscow or where have you local boy makes good you sound bitter grinned ellery in that case mr hendrix official records of the fox trial available to me eh the prosecutor threw up his hands four days later ellery dropped into chief of police dakin s office i was wonderin what happened to you said the chief boned up have you i ve been studying the old court records nose out anything if you mean errors t no chief dakin sighed i told you mr queen it was an open and shut case oh certainly ellery stared out the thief s window at the wrightsville light power company and the northern state telephone company buildings across state street the serene old elms he remembered intervened but they were agitated this morning it was a sunless blustery day but then i did nt expect to find anything startling i ve assumed all along that if there s anything to be found it will take more than library work very well i must say considering that detective howie s taken his orders literally and insists on occupying the same bed emily fox has given them the south room on the first floor tough on bayard said dakin he s up to it not so shy he s loosened up considerably though there s a good deal of strain between him and his brother talbot i wonder if there s anything behind that was there ever not that i know of they always got along in business fine so i understand anyway bayard sits around all day talking over old times with davy when davy s around which is nt often it s not easy for davy or getting acquainted with linda to whom he s taken a shine and filling out on emily s fruit pies that woman bakes a fillip pie the chief grunted so now what mr queen typewritten list of names dakin scanned the list slowly you want these people yes when on call from now on they re still in town yep even young jackson the negro boy that s more than i could have hoped for why do you say even young jackson abe l s in the army he s henry clay jackson s son the buttlin jackson ellery nodded grinning he recalled old henry clay in his buttling suit announcing dinner at the john f wrights when hermione wright had introduced ellery to her intime wrightsville friends during his first visit to the town but i saw abe on state street only this mornin you re holdin your get together at the bayard fox house mr queen oh yes i believe in atmospheres dakin ellery drummed softly on the chief s desk staring out s going to be on the gruesome side he muttered dakin winced must you it s where the murder took place but that house is a tomb mr queen it s been sealed up for a dozen years i d feel like a grave robber let s both feel like grave robbers the chief stared because i need a friendly presence complained ellery i m out to save two young people from a fate at least as bad as death howie is a depressing leech and i need a friendly presence dakin dakin reached for his visored hat may s well be hanged for a fool as a jackass he grunted shrugging okay mr queen let s go rob that grave later that morning ellery led a nervous procession across two lawns to the stained and weather cracked door of bayard fox s house an impression almost an impact door with the tarnished key emily fox had preserved in her trinket box next door for twelve years pas he pushed the door open it screamed it was as if the house itself were screaming at being awakened from its long sleep and when they walked into the musty foyer the feeling was intensified for the drawer of a mahogany reception table gaped as if it had just been jerked open inside they could see a puppy s leather collar a frosted electric bulb mess of papers greeting cards laundry hills scribbled housekeeping memoranda old letters a torn hairnet some marbles a wrightsville record dated june some cracked snapshots the litter and clutter of a rumpus drawer such as all living households no matter how efficiently managed can not escape maintaining and on the plum striped satin seat of a mahogany chair beside the table lay a boy s pullover red sweater where it had been cheerfully tossed as if only yesterday fine dust and a swarm of moths and collapsed one corner of the domestic oriental rug lapped over where a hurrying foot had tripped over it twelve years before a maxfield parrish reproduction ogled them from the streaked wallpaper above the table in need of a decent leveling touch through the blanket of gray dust and the webs of spider generations which choked the corners of the hall ceiling they perceived a house not in death but in
smart dragger after all i do nt know i ca nt tell i have nt the final say in such matters yet money talks old clem said this is fair talk cap n nora and useful good talk all here will stand by with an eye peeled but what about the fish that are on the feed now do we get them tomorrow or be foxed out of them she cried out get them we ll kill thirty thousand i said on the middle ground this time of year tide and wind being what they are we ll be needing a mark buoy whether we like it or not thereby we ll not have to take any man s word as to where the fish are or where the vessel is lying go tell that to the captain said nora and see that it s done she raised her i ll tell him myself i made way for her and she went down to the cabin alone the captain had already given the order for the rigging of the mark buoy despite the tragedy which had attended the setting of their last mark buoy he had seen that one was required for the middle ground tides when nora came down into the cabin he was lying in his bunk and atkins was seated on the locker near him a set of dry cell batteries in his hands either he or lenotre had picked up a lot of junk at shelburne for just this purpose there was a supply of old lifebelts and electric bulbs handy both of them greeted her with cheerful faces she answered by hoping that lenotre was feeling better he replied the truth of it is nora that when i fast as i did during the blow it takes me some time to get back on my feed i m all right and i m obliged to you for at once she wanted to disbelieve all that she had heard of him and all that she feared now yet she had struck on a way that might bring her the truth and she was determined to put the matter to its test she therefore sat down on the locker opposite them and idly stared at atkins clever hands over the gear she knew he had a good reputation as a rigger of such buoys it was the only good thing we had ever heard of him ile made them in such a way that they stayed upright and did nt sag they stayed put over the fish too she watched him yet she lifted her eyes now and then to trace out the changes in the captain s face which was always a puzzle to her and to me he seemed to be more than usually interested in atkins task and kept hustling him on with impatient words his listless mood had departed some inner energy newly stirred made his eyes hand through his matted hair and she remembered long afterward he once laughed aloud for no reason at all no question but these actions forced back into her memory certain images of their past images of which i know little and would like to know less anyway she instinctively let her eyelids fall halfway and for a time kept her gaze on her dirty boots it was the nearness of a once loved man and the knowledge that at any moment she might be alone with him which brought her suddenly to her feet captain lenotre delayed her smoothly stay a while nora please i ve something to say to you he gave to his voice the gentility that often marked his weariness after long fruitless voyages a thing i d marked in him before especially when he was telling lies if nora had kept her wits about her she might have seen that this was his old blarney nevertheless it suited her needs before nora could stand straight atkins was scurrying up the steps and lenotre was at her side his hands raised in the moment that the slide closed he put his arm around her in rough fashion and swung her toward him into a close embrace from what little i know of this happening there being a plain difficulty involved for me i judge that the captain mistook her trembling for something else which is understandable he tried hard to kiss her mouth this she denied to him she thrust against him in silence with her hands he did nt let her go being forewarned she perceived that his emotion was a fraud and that he had quite another purpose than the old one of courting her she then learned too the depths of her duplicity that she too could pretend certain things if it meant an advantage in the defense of the golden hind she lifted her hands to his shoulders and turned her mouth to his this and said at once i m in trouble nora awful trouble he struck his hand against his mouth i m the first skipper of this vessel that ever took whiskey aboard her i lied to you a minute ago about being off my feed i m in trouble she backed away from the ring of lamplight in order to clear the way for her eyes what is your trouble i know you re troubled what is it paul parren he sent a wild glance toward the dark skylight as if he could see the glare of the doubloon s deck lamps there i did nt want to tell you but well i m like the hind herself like you i owe him money lots of it and he s been putting the gaff on me for it how come you to owe a man like parren so much she had made a slip there of anything but friendliness between her and the dragger captain he did nt notice that meaning in her words he

you ve met the fellow who writes to you if you remember him and what you thought of him well when he writes to you you get to know him that much better and his letters seem to be extraordinary things they seem to come from something that s in every man in the world and as far as i ve been able to tell that thing is loneliness man is a lonely creature in spite of all the company there is for him in the sometimes he ll turn away from all the company in the world and take up with the dead he ll read the books men who lived long ago wrote or he ll take up with the fields and the sky and the creatures of them like thoreau did or he ll turn to some little domestic animal like a dog or a canary or a parrot or a turtle even or a goldfish or maybe a big animal like a horse they say arabs love their horses more than their wives or he ll take up with plants in a little garden of his own or if he has no garden he ll take up with little plants in pots but who s he looking for all the time he s looking for somebody to know him every letter i ever got had loneliness in it and eagerness to be in touch with someone who was not a stranger someone who remembered pharry cook s letters were a big surprise because i expected them were nt they were full of longing and nothing else most people long for something they ve already known such as a home or a farm or some neighborhood of a town or city but harry s longing was for the stuff that was ahead the thing i m hoping for he wrote in one of his letters is to be let alone some day so i can see if i can find out how to spend my life if i had my way i d never grow old and neither would anybody else i d just go to sleep some afternoon under some old apple tree and never wake up again joe foxhall s letters were not half as serious as his talk he told me the little things that had happened to him and he poked fun at the officers he knew dominic tosca was interested in only one thing how was victor victor wrote to him more often than i did but dominic wanted me to we got shipped try to work it out to stay with him he said pop s letters were the shortest i got your letter he would scribble read ecclesiastes again once quickly then two or three times slowly or i got your letter i m reading anderson i think you ll like him too so i d write and tell him i was reading anderson too and i d mention some of the stories and pop would write back and say hans christian is o k but i mean sher wood i wrote to cacalokowitz once too he was a good fellow just as i had expected and he said he was sorry he had nt answered sooner but he had been working very hard training a new company of men you d be surprised he wrote how much alike the men of every new company are the reason i wrote so many letters was that they organization so i had a lot of time i used to keep four or five sharpened pencils in my pocket and i used to keep a tablet with me all the time and envelopes so when everybody else was listening to the stuff about who s who in the army and how to tell for sure or how to get along when you re lost in the desert i d be in the back of the room writing to pop or lou or joe foxhall or dominic after we d finished school the sergeant asked me if i wanted topdo some typing for him and i said i did so after that i had a desk and a typewriter and spent most of my time typing announcements and reports for him i had a little cubby hole of a room of my own on the same floor with the writers so i guess it was natural for them to think i was a writer too once in a while one of them would come by and sit on the end of my i d tell him so then he d say i do nt mean for the army i mean for yourself i m writing a play wesley meets the army film writers and after seeing their training films is nt sure they are nt the real enemy there were about fifty writers in the writing department in new york i had to type a list of them one day for the sergeant so i knew their names but i did nt seem to remember having read a book by any of them i took the list with me to the public library on nd street one saturday afternoon to look them up one by one alphabetically well only one of them had published a book i wrote the number of the book on a slip of paper the book was fetched for me and i sat down to read it well it was a book all right it was printed on paper and it had covers it was a story too encountered in all the reading i ve done i read twenty pages at the beginning ten at the end and two in the middle but it was tiresome no matter where i went i wondered what kind of writers these writers were there did nt seem to be fifty writers in the whole country worth reading but there they were fifty of
he did nt get doc hinton but he got jinnie who had successfully delivered three babies for them and it was through jinnie slemp and two neighbor women there the night their child was born the story got out that the baby was marked with the devil vennie didmore vera pratt and midwife jinnie slemp all told the same story to the women in blakesburg they said the baby was born dead and that it was well and good it was born dead said it was born with a long tail and on its forehead were two little horns like noah put the dead baby in a box and carried it somewhere upon the mountain and buried it he would nt let anybody see it but these women had already seen it and they spread the news how it was marked with the devil but everybody agreed that it should be marked with the devil the way bertha and noah had lived since noah was a son of satan and bertha was satan s daughter charlie allbright said he had heard from reliable sources that both noah and bertha had gone out on the dark mountaintop away from the town at night and had prayed to the devil uglybird skelton had told charlie allbright that he was digging a grave one night when noah and bertha came to pray to the devil and that he ran them off lonesome hill with a mattock and now the devil had betrayed noah and bertha and no wonder they had paid the price by bertha s having a marked baby for their getting mixed up with such company reece nimrod had once taken a party of six the child was buried to hunt for its grave they knew they would see the signs of fresh dirt if they went soon enough they found the signs of fresh dirt which had been packed down by a recent rain but they dug through the packed dirt with their mattocks shoveled it away with their spades and had the top of the box off where they could peep in when out of a clear sky the clouds begin boiling up like giant thunderheads then it started thundering and lightening and the rain poured so they threw dirt back onto the grave and took off through the rain down the mountain side with their mattocks and shovels but they said the rain was the work of the devil for they had nt run a quarter of a mile until they reached sunshine and dry earth anybody in blakesburg will tell you if you go into the patch of woods where this devil marked baby is buried that it will start thundering and lightening and the rain will start pouring many people have tried it and the discovery told the townspeople the truth but the devil s sending this baby to bertha and noah changed their whole lives just as soon as a tent meeting came to blakesburg where the holiness preacher spoke through a loudspeaker not just to the tent packed with people but to the people all over the town it put bertha and noah on the lord s side they were sitting on the porch of their shack near the railroad tracks listening to the good guitar music and the singing by the gospel singers and the words of the little preacher when they got the call and ran to the tent there they threw themselves upon the altar and they had some confession to make they confessed to their allegiance with the devil how they said they had thought he was being mistreated because they had only heard god s story and not the devil s story they told how they had gotten all lickered up on the devil s medicine and went to the mountain top together and had prayed to the devil one of these meetings on the mountaintop when they were under the influence of the devil before the tent packed with people they made all these confessions and warned the people to beware of the devil for he would in the end betray them it was such a good message that the little preacher wanted to get it over to his people in the town he had them to make another confession through the loudspeaker so all the people in the town would hear and then came the payoff for the tent meeting when a man and a woman as wicked as noah and bertha billups could get saved and redeemed by the blood there was a chance for everybody no matter how wicked no matter what he had done and people fell to their knees until the confession altar was packed and the floor of the tent was full there had never been such revival and soul warming as this tent meeting with the little preacher the good guitar music and the gospel singers that was why noah and skies bertha the time has come noah said as they stood side by side on their front porch looking toward the north with light in their eyes christ is a coming bertha put her arm around noah and hugged close to him while he beamed with happiness and lifted his face toward the great panorama of light honey i m glad bertha said i m glad we saw the light two years ago glory be to god noah said joyously waving his hands above his head glory be to god christ s a comin look fer him in the clouds when their children heard noah shouting they ran out on the porch to see what was going on what caused that light papa asked the oldest one christ is comin herbie noah said we re a goin to leave blakesburg where we a goin papa daisy bertha said not in these clothes mama herbie said while the little one tagged at bertha s dress frightened until he screamed at the
alone for she was a woman who would never be completely herself except through another person within a relationship and for all its outward slightness this was a real relationship and one which fully occupied her heart strange she thought as she and then the intoxication of the smoke in her lungs looking out as she had done a million times on the red tiled roofs opposite and the row of pigeons six years of her life were framed by this static scene strange how in a novel it would be inconceivable that she should still be sitting here no writer she thought half amused at the idea would dare to hold two people in such suspense for so long a time once on some warm spring evening he would have kissed her or more likely the tension would have exploded finally in a quarrel and she would have left the business as indeed she had thought of doing many times but a real life was so much longer and more obscure than a life in any novel for the novelist inevitably looks to the few moments of crisis to illuminate his characters whereas she thought character is really developed and matured in the interminable spaces between in six years paul and still she sat here looking at the red roofs and the pigeons waiting for him to finish his drawing and talk to her as she had done years and years ago and still the suspense was there the bubble of excitement in her throat when she knocked at the door the sense of something imminent between them which might at any moment in all the years have resolved itself and yet she saw now would never never do so what is jacques doing she asked suddenly oh i do nt know paul answered indifferently still absorbed in what he was doing he s got a little shop of his own now and makes a good living mending old furniture and making an occasional piece he has become a satisfied paterfamilias he has settled down his tone mocked the words as if nothing could be more stupid and fruitless than jacques s life we never see him any more and then a point before laying it down he added what made you ask and sat down with a sigh opposite her thinking as he did so we are getting old my poor louise for she did indeed look badly this morning i was wondering about francoise paul shrugged oh francoise has forgotten all that that s ancient history at her age six years is an eternity and at our age she smiled a little sadly a moment an interminable moment which is quite a different thing we have nt changed or hardly but francoise is a different person what is she like i never see her any more paul smoked for a moment in silence he was thinking of how little he really knew of his eldest daughter she has succeeded admirably in divorcing herself from her family she lives with us but that is the most that can be talk about her plans and her work but as for what really goes on inside her you know as much as i do he smiled with a trace of bitterness she has made her escape is she happy louise asked innocently a perfectly irrelevant question no one is happy at twenty one she s fearfully ambitious she is determined to be graduated avec la plus grande distinction i have an idea that she has wrapped her emotional life up in a sort of cocoon for the time being but how do i know he added she never brings any of her school friends home any more all sorts of things may be going on and that does nt worry you and madame louise could nt imagine melanie not knowing what was happening to her children everyone spoke of the duchesne family as the closest the most intimately linked of any family they knew it had often been discussed downstairs that and the well paul said quietly you know it was a battle for years but then francoise won after the business about jacques she never confided in us again she s a strong character stronger even than her mother because she is more personally ambitious and even melanie finally understood that francoise had won her independence not by moving out by going away which i m sure she must have considered but within the family that is quite a triumph eh he ended as if he enjoyed the triumph immensely himself you are generous paul no i m not generous not a bit i should be fearfully jealous of any man francoise loved which is i suppose why it s a good thing that i am unaware of that not impossible he if he exists and then he added as an afterthought melanie is generous yes she is on that made them inevitably think of themselves louise especially with her divided loyalty could never hear the name without a sharp pain and feeling the emotion in the silence paul was drawn in spite of himself to speak to explore the wound to put a new dressing on it it s not been a very gay six years for you my poor louise he said gently i do nt know she said looking at him steadily with her clear glance not gay perhaps not empty either at least she added half humorously i have nt settled down paul got up and began to pace the floor he was irritated with himself for going on with this irritated by his own lack of courage with his holding on to her love because in some way he needed it now if she were not there in that chair for an hour or so every day he would miss little and that so negative little more than this irritation this rest lessness and
startled one evening at sundown by a sudden great blowing of horns on the roof tops supplemented by the firing of cannon on the forts and a more than ordinary hullabaloo on the part of the muezzinsin the minarets at first we were apprehensive what all this might mean fearing some new victory by the tripolines but hamet who had just finished our daily lesson in arabic explained that it only marked the beginning of the month of ramadan in which all moslems are called upon to fast and no true follower of lips from sunup until sundown as may be imagined this somewhat complicated our task for the prohibition against food and drink it appeared extended also to medicines however we got around this difficulty by sleeping all day and visiting our patients by night when whatever we ordered was taken with good grace during this period cowdery had the good fortune to cement our relations with the bashaw by curing his child of a particularly virulent bout of the intermittent fever while i solidified our relations with the porte by attending the ambassador from constantinople i was returning from one of my visits to this gentleman s house one evening when i was called to while passing a coffee stall and requested to enter upon responding i found the lord high admiral of tripoli no other than our old enemy peter lysle the scotch runagate who under the name of murad rais had commanded the bashaw s ships which the essex had so long since bottled up in gibraltar he did not recognize me nor did and invited me to be seated beside him among the cushions and offered me coffee in thimble sized cups after some polite conversation in the course of which he inquired after captain bainbridge and how we did he came to the point and stated that he had heard that i had some skill in medicine and surgery i replied that i did my best in my humble way whereupon he asked me if i would accept him as a patient when i told him that i would be glad to do what i could for him he beamed and pulled up his shirt to show me a great malignant carbuncle upon his belly he wanted it removed he told me not so much because of the pain which was negligible but rather because of the effect it had upon his wives who he said could scarcely bear to look upon it without shuddering i could not help smiling at the picture but said that i would have to operate upon it i thought it could be done was agreeable but even pressed me to perform the surgery on the earliest possible occasion accordingly a day or two later i did so making a very clean job of it i will say for him that he scarcely flinched once under the knife although i was obliged to go quite deep to get at the roots of the growth ile made an excellent recovery and apparently his domestic difficulties were solved for he was so delighted that he became a fast friend after his fashion and had me often to his house for supper entertaining me lavishly with both food and drink for although he had turned turk his conscience remained elastic in the matter of alcohol on these occasions he would have in the slave girls from his harem and have them dance for us all the while urging me to turn my coat and settle down in tripoli where he vowed i could make a fortune as a physician i confess i was sometimes tempted he had a nice taste who looks upon mountains of flesh as an attribute of beauty and stupidity as a female virtue he even went so far as to offer me my pick barring of course his wives of which he had three but his price was too high and i found myself always able gently but firmly to refuse our cordiality toward one another was in no way affected by my obdurateness and later when he called upon me to treat his wives for various ailments of the country i came to understand his concern over his former difficulties for if his dancing girls were lovely these three made them all look like broomstick witches by the end of ramadan we had settled down to a routine which was not unbearable early in february the bashaw appointed cowdery physician to his family and myself physician to the court a day or two later he issued an edict permitting the officers to walk out in groups of six under guard about the town and i flatter due at least in part to our good services apart from the fact that we remained prisoners we might have found ourselves reasonably content a forceful reminder however remained of our shame this was the philadelphia which now lay close under the guns of the forts and within sight from our windows much had been accomplished upon her her foremast had been replaced and her tattered rigging repaired her guns had been raised and remounted even her anchors had been brought up and bent to new cables murad rais gleefully took pains to inform me that he had been appointed to command her and announced that within the month he expected to put to sea at the same time playfully jabbing me in the ribs and bidding me mind what liberties i took with his harem in his absence one afternoon toward mid february cowdery and i were called to treat the bashaw s eldest daughter whose husband was minister of war her case was not complicated and we prescribed for her we did so hamet called our attention to two merchantmen out beyond the reefs beating in for the harbor we looked at them without much interest a small brig of somehow rather familiar lines and a ketch of mediterranean
gone on like that deep in its routine and ended in comparative tranquility if dowdy had not appeared perhaps the doctor would have remained merely pensively philosophical perhaps although these things are by no means certain it could be persuasively argued that the imminent departure of lieutenant roberts was too shocking a mutation for the ship to absorb without a brief compensatory period of chaos or it could be more baldly argued that certain factions of the ship s company were simply ready for a good bender at any rate dowdy did appear and the evening did attain to a certain violence and the doctor did to a certain extent go berserk as a drunk the doc was of the unpredictable sort up to a certain point he was disciplined if loquacious beyond that point the doc got pretty primitive there was the time at an officers club at one of the islands when he tried to do battle with a four striper silly looking who was not only twice his rank but twice his size as well if he had not been also twice as drunk the doctor would undoubtedly have been a candidate for portsmouth naval prison that was one time and there had been several others it was after ten o clock when dowdy knocked on the door he stood sober and purposeful in the doorway hear you re leaving us he addressed roberts when this was confirmed he went on well a few of us are having a little party down in the armory and they said for me to ask you down to have a drink with us that s all of you naturally he added roberts questioned the doc with a look sure thing said the doc expansively hell yes we ll have a drink but first you have one with us dowdy did that and he did better than that he had two then the doc said we might as well quart of alcohol now reduced to less than a pint stuck it under his shirt and then in single file the doc leading ensign pulver trailing the group repaired to the armory they met a noisy reception the new party was already in an advanced state the armory was not a large room and now it was crowded there was olson of course and there was stefanowski of course kalinka the shipfitter and vanessi the storekeeper were sitting on the workbench the two gunner s mates wiley and schaffer were leaning on the rifle rack denowsky was not fixed but mobile wandering up and down the large ten gallon crock sat on the deck in almost the geometrical center of the room right away the doc made a perfect gesture one that symbolically and in fact wedded the two groups he pulled out the bottle of alcohol flourished it and emptied its contents into the crock the cheers were almost deafening dowdy was of the amalgamated alcohol and jungle juice for the newcomers this here is a brand new batch he explained to them it turned out pretty good the last batch we made there was something the matter with it i guess we let it set too long it had kind of a green crust on top wiley there drank some and he peed green the next day what do you suppose caused that doc oh some kind of a fungus growth in the bladder the doc said airily this is good stuff yeah said dowdy anyway i give that last batch away to the engineers it did nt look good to me and you ca nt hurt an engineer then the toasts began stefanowski made the first and considering the occasion it was just about perfect although he stood a little unsteadily his words were firm and brave now by god this drink is for the roberts and that ai nt saying nothing against the rest of you officers because i think we got a good bunch of officers on this ship stefanowski paused and qualified except for that shithead of a captain and i think we got the best of the lot here tonight but by god i say and i bet you other officers agree with me that mister roberts is absolutely the tops and i m sure sorry to see him go and by god i think we ought to drink to him it is hard to see how it could have been more nicely put and stefanowski s toast was promptly and noisily executed there were many others the toast idea caught the fancy of the party and the level of the improved jungle juice went down markedly in the crock after all present had been honored toasts were drunk to among others bela kun chili williams the captain s early demise girls who wore black pants no pants cordell hull winnie ruth judd boo boo hoff and marjorie ann lundberg of coffeyville kansas these necessarily took a long time though not as long as you might expect and in the course of them dowdy sidled over to lieutenant roberts say he said secretively tom olson s got a good idea he says we ought to take care of the old man s palm trees tonight you know the old man s got that watch up there now but olson says that red mclaughlin went on at midnight and hell if he did he s asleep by now hell it s twelve fifteen and you know red mclaughlin so maybe if you and me and olson sort of sneak up there now the thing was done with style dowdy was right red mclaughlin was asleep propped against the captain s bulkhead the two palm trees were removed from their five gallon cans and dumped over the side red mclaughlin was sleeping with both arms outstretched and the and olson did everything they insisted it was their turn roberts s role was that of honored observer and
summers said his hand came over and gave boone the empty rifle and took the loaded one and drew away with it load up the indians had sat watching the one and yelling for him they hushed when he fell and then all began to yell again the voices rising shrill and falling they set their horses to a run streaking to one side and then the other not coming directly at boone and summers but working closer as the line went back and forth sometimes one bolder than the rest would charge out of the line and come nearer waving his gun or bow while he shouted and then go back to the line again hold your sights on one said summers the one on the speckled pony hold fire till i tell you then plumb center with it he had taken his pistols from his belt and had them out before him on the horses swinging to the off side as they turned shoo summers said they ca nt ride for nothin ca nt shine with comanches or even crows why nt they charge all of em summers eye ran along the barrel of his gun they got no stummick for that kind of doin s save once in a while one likes to shine alone like that nigger out there a rifle cracked and in front of them the ground exploded in a little blast of dust steady time to go ag in out of the corner of his eye boone saw smoke puff from the gun a running horse stumbled and fell the indians shouted higher and wilder the fallen horse lay on its rider boone saw the rider just the head and jerking hands of him beyond the horse trying to pull his leg free summers handed over the empty rifle two from the off sides of their horses and stooping behind the downed horse rolled the withers up the fallen rider tried to arise and went off crawling dragging one leg the others driven back a little by the shot began to come in again working to and fro one of them bobbed up and swung his rifle over the ball sang past boone he had the rifle primed again and the indian on the speckled pony on his sights kin i shoot one he did nt wait the sights seemed to steady of themselves and fix just above the pony s neck his fingers bore on the trigger like it had a mind of its own the rifle jumped i be dogged the speckled pony shied off behind him a man squirmed on the ground squirmed and got up and went back bent at the middle slicker n ice caudill the indians bunched up talking and gesturing said summers raising his cheek from his rifle he added for now that s the boat the trumpet had sounded cutting through the still air rolling up river and out to the hills and coming back on itself boone saw the mandan the oars made little even flashes as the men laid them back someone was busy in the bow it looked like jourdonnais it was him working at the swivel gun which was a bar of light in the how the indians looked holding their horses tight easing them backward away from the river the swivel belched smoke and the sound of it came to them a rolling boom like thunder jourdonnais got busy with it again first shot was just to skeer em second ll be business but the sioux drew off turning back and shouting and shaking their arms as they went boone watched them long enough to see that they picked up in his belt and fitted his wiping stick to his rifle he and boone walked ahead to the indian who lay still in the grass summers stooped over his knife cut into the scalp and made a rough circle from which the blood beaded he got hold of the indian s short hair and tore the circle loose leaving the piece of skull naked and raw take his gun this injun s had a grief lately some of his kin s gone under a brother maybe that s why he chopped his tails off looks recent do nt it like as not it just happened that s why they was so froze for our scalps so s they would nt have to go home beaten and with nary thing to shine with he went back and picked up his bundle of meat carrying scalp and bundle in one hand the mandan pulled in so close they could hop aboard jourdonnais bold dark face questioned their eyes big and watchful like the eyes of a frog ready to jump if a man took another step summers said we put one under and winged two the barrel of his rifle swung toward boone there s a hoss as ll shoot plumb center in tones that boone barely overheard he went on we ai nt seen the last of em i m thinkin pummers was right but for a day and part of another while they went by the riviere a jacques and headed on toward the l eau qui court jourdonnais told himself that he was nt there was nt one sign of indian not even to summers who watched the shores hour after hour searching with his trained gray eye summers face was sober but not worried jourdonnais wondered if he ever worried this big loose built man who was like a wise old dog watching him gazing down from his place at the steering oar jourdonnais wondered nt care for money or a nice house or pretties for a wife if he had one he lived like a wild thing to eat and frolic and keep his scalp not thinking from one day to another not putting by against the future if jourdonnais had nt found him fresh back from
go when he fell abel dragged him back into the bow night came on the half moon rose and cast light scantily over the sea the face of the moon beamed when the sky became black the moon glowed the westerly swell had lengthened now the light coldly glancing off the moon glanced along the swell and made a saffron moonglade down this he sailed his dory adorned by spikes of gold and his sail a cloth of silver stars came out and burned blue in the black abel sought the pole star mumbled some words to it and steered on lesser stars came out in the west all of these shone clearly and all save one were delicately hued by emerald light as if the bonny forests yonder were of these beamers was not a star it was a light flashing at short intervals it had the hue of a candle flame this difference escaped abel s eye because it required a gaze too fine and steady for him to make he could nt keep his head up that long nevertheless he seemed disturbed by that changing light at times he squinted in that direction and mumbled his failure to make something of it angered him he brushed his sleeve against the frozen lather of his mouth he tried the words again at last he said them i should like to know and more passionately you you the first sentence had been uttered in a calm fashion the words that followed expressed yearning tenderness they were said in a sighing way vapor swept the horizon from north to west all the stars vanished at once a moaning began in the region where the light had flashed a terrible down like a man moaning in anguish of frost and thinned to a crescendo a prolonged walpurgis syllable fit to summon the condemned once again abel s senses failed him he believed this moan came from stephen s mouth he made his way forward and heaved him to his feet stephen fell and groaned ice crackled in the folds of his oilskins abel struck him gently on the face and heavily on shoulders and thighs stephen groaned he flung up his hands abel seized them and worked them back and forth he dragged him down to the forward thwart and turned him over so that he crouched on hands and knees he kicked him on the behind this started stephen crawling forward he had life in him and some heat he had wit enough to seek his shelter this pleased abel he grunted standing over his brother he again heard the moaning of the sable island sirens he could see that stephen struggled in silence up the steering oar soon after the vapor had gone away the signals in the west ceased the stars shone again the wind stayed fair for him once more he slept or seemed to sleep slouched against the oar one arm crooked around the handle he plied his trade in long unbroken rollings the swell lifted him into the company of stars then drew him down into blackness so he sailed until moon set until rise of morning star which came in peaceful glory harbinger of blue peaceful days all other stars were dimmed by the vermilion whirl of the day star yet far down only the morning star increased in beauty great venus borrowing before all others the sun fire casting it aloft and abroad and to the westward whither he must go he witnessed the change and understood awkwardly and in pain he twisted his body toward her stared under lowered lids he beheld her the single heavenly black he gave her a nod he held up his compass and caught her rays therein her beauty gave him new life because the revelation of the needle made him howl harshly he howled and stephen answered by a moan abel shouted to the sky his slobbered face distorted in all that beauty and befouling it on the flower yet t was nothing he had steered north a space not long his excitement could hardly be real no it was a shrewdness by his inner self provoking a sound thought an appeal to his seamanship which in turn should cause a bold affirmative action grumbling he trimmed her shifted his oar and laid her on the old course he examined the compass again ah a vessel of some sort appeared directly north of the dory she could not be made out at all that is her hull and masts were out of sight either she gave off a constant and icy flashing now there were a thousand glints and gleams on the ocean there all of these had the unsubstantial quality of tiderips and spray a man would nt give them much of his attention that constant flash had more to it a depth which proved that it came off wood moreover it advanced and in one direction northwest had abel stayed on his mistaken course he might have steered to leeward of the stranger and thus missed her as it was both of them were steering on courses that might bring them close to each other the sun came up and flung a shower of mild light across the world this served to change the quality of the stranger s flashing indeed the glare came so brightly that it seemed like signals off a glass to abel a long flash a short one two long ones what then an inquiry do you require assistance what vessel is nt the stranger s story a feeble glance which was all that abel had to give might have been thus deceived the flashes were meaningless when watched for even a minute except for this one fact now certain that a craft lay there and on a course directed by human hands whose hands hard to say at that remove the space between the two craft lessened at a
damned business it s just nature am i right and if it s just nature and just a personal matter who are they to interfere let me tell you a thing if you got yourself up one night and had an inspiration and went into eunie s room and give her a couple of pokes you d be doing her a favor i do nt care how tight she goes around looking you re a man got a good education you tell me am i wrong no of course you re not wrong nt know about eunice so there you are just like i said and mark my words the day will come when people going to get some sense that s my way of thinking about it duck turned full to laskell and said and i want to tell you another thing mr laskell he paused to arouse curiosity about the other thing he was going to tell he stood with his mouth poised to speak then he said you may think i got a low mind but i ai nt talking like a young kid that wants his first piece and ca nt wait till he gets it i mean to say there s just so many apples on a tree a man s got just so much in him and no more and believe me i did nt spare none of mine maybe you know how that is guess maybe i m older than you but maybe you live the same way not sparing yourself what you got you got and what you lose you do nt get back and duck opened his mouth and pointed to the gap in his upper teeth even if i got me some store teeth they might look good but they would nt be my teeth what s gone is gone well anyway what i was saying what you lose you lose so i m talking from my head duck covered his brow with the palm of his hand it comes from here he said and not from you know where and duck clutched you know where so it ai nt a crazy hot idea he concluded then he added yet still and he grinned yet still i d like to have me a poke at that eunie folger they left the gorge and cut a wide circle and came to the stream again it was strong and rapid even now in august but it can follow up from here easy enough duck said and when you want to find your way back you ll see where it cuts in close to the road and that s only a mile on the road from the folgers house pand he stood there while laskell jointed his rod fixed on the reel threaded the line through the guides and tied on the leader the fly that laskell chose was a coachman it was not a rational choice but he could not under duck s eye stop to study the stream as kermit simpson had taught him to do when he was ready duck said well good luck then he said you one of those fishermen takes a flask with him i m sorry i did nt bring one i just thought duck said he went away but he left his void behind him left it with laskell and in him his laskell might think it it was simply void it was nothing the pure will of nothingness or it was the nothingness of pure will it was not wickedness it was emptiness masking itself as mind and desire laskell thought of the wan white eunice folger of duck s speculations and of emily duck s wife whose relation with this man he laskell had but a few minutes before made to count for so much to his credit and he thought of mrs folger and nancy and of their poor misplaced confidence in duck s manliness and of his own misplaced confidence in their female judgment it was perhaps funny that he had no sooner decided to accept their estimate of duck s masculinity than duck himself had been to such pains to set him straight but laskell felt no impulse to laugh lack of practice made him awkward with his casting he dutifully reminded himself of all the things he must think about arm close to the body wrist loose he did not believe that it made any difference he did not really believe that there were fish in the stream or that he could catch them or that fish had ever been caught by this method you equipped yourself expensively you learned the technique you did everything the way you had been taught and even for the deceptive pleasure of it you debated the theory of flies with other fishermen arguing about just what it was that the fish saw when the fly floated over its head but nothing really happened or whatever happened happened for quite other reasons and not because you did what you did he moved slowly upstream unsure of his footing his thighs were tired and he moved more carefully than the current required he did not like the way he moved he was not being wary but nervous but the stream began to do some of its work on laskell the morning mist cleared away and the air freshened the sun came through the overhang of hole and then vanish into it a kingfisher worked the stream ahead of him for a few minutes it was as blue and direct as lightning his blood began to pick up a little with the exercise some sense of possibility returned to him he began to like being alone he forgot about duck forgot about mrs folger s estimate of duck and nancy s and his own and how they had just been contradicted by duck s own statement he forgot about everything except himself and then he forgot
discover represented two very different types of navy mustang the differences between them were largely characteristic in exaggerated fashion of the great cleavage between the bridge and the engine room on the bridge in an atmosphere of clear skies and blue waves of flag officers pacing to and fro there is a consciousness of centralized control and a tremendous emphasis on appearance it is a world of sharp commands and quick maneuvers where speed means more wind in your face and causes more rippling of the many colored signal flags that soar up to the yardarm and fall away with such grace and the rudder is something far below that at a touch of the hand swerves the big ship in column with her sisters but in the engine room these concepts are associated with sweat and heat and the hard working machinist s mates who labor on the throttles to produce the outward show are more constantly in juxtaposition with the caverns of ugliness that in most things sustain the fragile and beautiful exterior of life bill ellis had joined the navy at seventeen and until the war he had always been in the bridge gang of capital ships attaining at last the smug elevation of chief quartermaster he had been handsome almost dashing as a boy one need not linger on the details of his introduction in full innocence to the routine naval liberty in tropical ports perhaps if he had had a family atmosphere behind him or even some slight extra naval interest intellectual or otherwise with which to combat these impressions he might have been rescued but as it was he embraced the life of bars and brothels without the slightest hesitation and as every man must have some pattern in his life some sort of skeleton to hang his varying impulses and excursions to if his personality is not to degenerate to that of a tramp ellis turned to the navy more and more no man presented a neater appearance on the bridge no one was more intent with binoculars on the flag ship s signal halyards or cried execute more gymnastic snap small wonder that when so many enlisted men were raised to temporary commissioned rank to meet the war s increased needs ellis should have been recommended by no less than a vice admiral he knew his navy at least he knew the bridge life was a simple matter on shore it was a succession of bars where girls could be picked up at sea it was a series of deftly executed signals and carefully checked chronometers his health record dotted as it was with venereal entries contrasted curiously with the neatly entered commendations in his service jacket it was easy to see why he made a poor officer he lacked the remotest understanding of the why in life or even in the navy and stripped of the snap and polish of the peacetime battleship he found on the small patrol craft to which he was now assigned only a constant reminder of how nice things had been when they were done right this added to the panic which he felt when he began to ship produced a temper almost permanently bad which in turn resulted in the type of absurd reaction that in a crisis say an imminent collision would make him suddenly turn to a signalman on the bridge and yell do nt you know you ca nt wear white socks up here and then the crisis averted through the quick thinking of his officer of the deck he would rush below to his cabin and in the neat distinguished hand that had been molded by his old navy log writing produce memorandum after memorandum on the wearing of the correct uniform of the day his moods lifted and fell with remarkable speed and variability and his junior officers never knew what to expect or where to expect it with them he was utterly at a loss and he alternated between giving them complete authority and treating them with the contempt that he had meted out in former days to signalman strikers on the colorado yet rather pathetically he liked them all wrote them excellent fitness reports smiled when he smiled and said nothing when he growled but all the while he was uncomfortably conscious of the unanimous dislike in which his uncontrollable temper quite aside from the social barrier inevitably present between the college graduate reserve and the mustang had caused him to be held he was fairly congenial with foster but the latter at heart hated him for his failure to understand machinery and his drafting of machinist s mates from necessary engine room duty to assist deck hands in the constant painting and cleaning of the ship which ellis battleship background made him emphasize at the expense of drills instruction and even vital repairs foster was a realist he had started life from an even lower rung than ellis having been the son of a poor maine farmer he had never been the spoiled darling of the quarterdeck his life in the navy had been a long and arduous experience in boiler rooms in engine rooms amid throttles and generators listening always to the deafening hum of spinning shafts second two first there had been no admirals to give him a push he had risen laboriously to lieutenant j g through warrant arriving at this incredible altitude of commissioned rank only after one year of war at the age of forty when he was ten years older than his present captain but he had taught himself the world had some meaning he read newspapers magazines he was married happily too unlike ellis and had two children who lived near the navy yard at san diego he reached out to people and only occasionally now did the long jungle habits of survival of the fittest acquired so necessarily by the ugly farm boy kicked around by machinist s mates
i must have time to find another plaything like this and to train myself in the use of it you ll have that much longer to live d arlay he scowled you will hear from me when i m ready agreed said d arlay and now said d arlay when he and his companion found themselves again in the street we shall seek the comfort and security of the rue grenier sur l eau i confess to a weariness both of mind and body the scot snorted indignantly there will be no rest for you for another hour at least he laid a commanding hand on d arlay s shoulder i know an arms master here in paris one gaspard soullaine who has the best hand with the sword i ve ever seen in action you will be in need of his services my lord if you re to get yourself into proper condition to meet this great bully and braggart that i could

will be as hard to resist as a blustering wind from the north come gaspard s place is a half hour s walk from here we must see him tonight and engage his services chapter viiivalerie went to bed in such a confused state of mind that the only impression she got of her bedroom was of its terrifying grandeur she roused next morning when the first light of dawn came through the windows wide awake at once she was gratefully conscious of the softness of the bed on which she lay she gave a low exclamation of wonder over the coverlet which was embroidered in blue and gold with a most curious device the heart and shell which as she learned later was the coeur insigne and immediately under the canopy a shelf for books and attached to the shelf a bag tilled with aromatic herbs there was a candlestick on a table and it was at least two feet high and as big around as her wrist she lay perfectly still for several minutes thinking of what had happened the day before and wondering what plans were hatching in the mind of the owner of this huge stone building what a strange man she said to herself his eyes seem to burn i know he s kind in spite of all his sharpness and the way he hurries how i wish i knew what he has in mind to do with me she was certain of one thing that all this mystery had to do with the problem of her parentage jacques coeur had known at first glance who she resembled and had assisted the sire d arlay to the same knowledge what else could it mean today she said aloud sitting up in bed and i am her thoughts went from there to the sire d arlay and became firmly anchored this second encounter with him had confirmed the impressions he had carried away from the first he was not handsome and he had none of the airs and affected manners she associated with highest gentility hut in spite of that she had no doubt at all that he was a great gentleman he was showing himself just as kind as he had during that long evening when they labored together at the fashioning of the coffin and she had confided to him so much about herself she thought with a surge of pride he likes me it was gratifying and exciting to know that he liked her even though she had made no serious effort to define for herself how she left about him her thoughts came back to the beauty and wonder of this room she studied the prie dieu against one wall it was tall and had panels of red needlepoint there was a bench piled up luxuriantly with a crucifix with so much compassion depicted on the face that her own eyes filled with tears she measured the width of the bed with an incredulous eye and decided that as many as five people could sleep in it how fine to have it all to oneself and be able to stretch right out she had always been cramped as to sleeping space in the maret tent and in malodorous rooms in taverns in fact there had been for her something mean and furtive the moneyman the moneyman about slumber a need to dress and undress hurriedly and under a certain constant inspection she threw back the covers and set herself to test the width by rolling across the bed she accomplished six revolutions safely but the seventh projected her over the side she landed on the floor with a loud thump she was on the point of raising herself rather ruefully when her eyes fixed themselves on a pair of shoes beside a chair they were unbelievably lovely the leather was and the first foliage on the trees the tops were turned back to reveal an inside lining of soft white material the greatest glory of these amazing shoes however was the presence of a bow of yellow velvet on the instep of each she lay still and looked at them not fully trusting the evidence of her eyes something was wrong she had put her clothes the night before on this particular chair and had deposited her own shoes beside it thinking at the time how out of place they looked what had happened slowly she raised her eyes finding further food for surprise at each stage of the elevation the chair was covered with clothes but not the old and somewhat bedraggled objects she had left there before getting into bed all her own clothing was gone and in its stead was a complete new outfit she sprang

in a harsh almost savage voice well and he had nt put on his shoes nor even picked up the dangling galluses and he did nt seem to have heard miss habersham at all just standing looming bulging in the door looking at miss habersham not at the hat not at her eyes nor even look at a string of letters in russian or chinese which someone you believed had just told you spelled your name saying at last in a musing baffled voice no then turning his head to look at him and saying it ai nt you neither then turning his head further until he was looking at aleck sander while aleck sander slid his eyes up at the sheriff then slid them away again then slid them up again you the sheriff said you re the one you went out there in the dark and helped dig up a dead man not only that a dead white man that the rest of the white folks claimed another nigger had murdered why was it because miss habersham made you never nobody made me aleck sander said i did nt even know i was going i had done already told chick i did nt aim to only when we got to the truck everybody seemed to just take it for granted i was i knowed it i was nt mr hampton miss habersham said now the sheriff looked at her he even heard her now have nt you finished slicing that meat yet he said give me the knife then he took her by the arm turning her back to the table flint you done enough rushing and stewing around tonight to last you a while it ll be daylight in fifteen minutes and folks do nt start lynchings in daylight they might finish one by daylight if they had a little trouble or bad luck and got behind with it but they do nt start them by daylight because then they would have to see one another s faces how many can eat more than two eggs they left aleck sander with his breakfast at the kitchen table and carried theirs into the diningroom he and his uncle and miss habersham carrying the platter of fried eggs and meat and the pan of biscuits baked last night and warmed again in the oven until they unstrained grounds and the water had been boiling together until the sheriff had thought to remove the pot from the hot part of the stove four of them although the sheriff had set five places and they had barely sat down when the sheriff raised his head listening though he himself heard nothing then rose and went into the dark hall and toward the rear of the house and then he heard the sound of the back door and presently the sheriff came back with will legate though minus the shotgun and he turned his head enough to look out the window behind him and sure enough it was daylight the sheriff served the plates while his uncle and legate passed theirs and the sheriff s cup to miss habersham at the coffeepot then at once he seemed to have been hearing for a long time the sheriff from a great distance saying boy boy then wake hint up gavin let him eat his breakfast before he goes to sleep and he jerked it was into the same cup and he began to eat chewing and even swallowing rising and falling as though to the motion of the chewing along the deep soft bottomless mire of sleep into then out of the voices buzzing of old finished things no longer concern of his the sheriff s do you know jake montgomery from over in crossman county been in and out of town here for the last six months or so then legate s sure a kind of jackleg timber buyer now used to run a place he called a restaurant just across the tennessee line out of memphis though i never heard of nobody trying to buy nothing that had to be chewed in it until a man went and got killed in it one night two three years ago they never did know just how much jake did or did nt have to do with it but the tennessee police run him back across the mississippi line just on principle since then i reckon he s been laying around his pa s farm over beyond have forgot about that other business and he can set up again in another place on a highway with a hole under the floor big enough to hide a case of whiskey in what was he doing around here the sheriff said then legate buying timber ai nt he ai nt him and vinson gowrie then legate said with the barest inflection was and then with no inflection at all what is he doing and he this time his own voice indifferent along the soft deep edge of sleep too indifferent to bother if it were aloud or not he ai nt doing anything now but it was better afterward out of the stale warm house again into the air the morning the sun in one soft high level golden wash in the highest tips of the trees gilding the motionless obese uprush of the town water tank in spiderlegged elongate against the blue the four of them in his uncle s car once more while the sheriff even to a bright orange and yellow necktie saying to his uncle you run miss eunice home so she can get some sleep i ll pick you up at your house in say an hour miss habersham in the front seat with his uncle said pah that was all she did nt curse she did nt need to it was far more definite and final than just cursing she leaned forward to look past his uncle at the sheriff
a moment through the light below the royal cushions his adam s apple throbbed his tongue kept darting like a lizard s finally he slipped into a corner and disappeared from sight now the women strode forth the drums grew more sonorous their long silky bodies began to sway like fascinated cobras a permeating scent of ripe mangoes filled the air the king tapped me lightly on the shoulder his eyes were gleaming yes my friend i too was young once long very long ago i was the finest dancer in the tribe and the finest lover i made love he murmured nostalgically seven times a day and later five i was famous throughout the congo yes and not only for the frequency for the skill as well and for the fantasy he closed his eyes with the grief of ancient memories and now all is over youth vanishes strength fades only the skill remains and the patience of course once a day is sufficient now my fame has died throughout the congo soon i ll be forgotten the drums rolled on pierced by the rippling of a flute in the distance strange noises seemed to be rising from the brush an orchestral accompaniment of rustlings and barkings squeals and ululations the whole jungle was joining in the balbongi women swayed their hips and ground their shimmering thighs the men rose out of the shadows and crept up behind them with their furry and feathery and scaly masks they looked like beasts of prey silently stalking their victims the women closed their eyes in a frenzy of abandonment the trumpets emerged the loincloths were dropped the stench of perspiration spread one of the women leapt into the center and a buffalo mask rushed forth with a roar drew a scimitar from its crimson sheath flashed it about then pointed it rigidly at the woman s body she gyrated like one possessed flinging her head to left and right drawing closer and closer to the buffalo spirit leaning back further and further till her long black head almost touched the ground her throat and belly throbbed with the pulse of her breath she smiled with a crucial all enveloping resignation as the scimitar entered her sex and the drops of blood began to fall cut cut the balbongis cried as the scimitar struck again and again cut cut they all cried in their high desolate voices then the woman collapsed and was carried off to the palace the dancers continued it was an obscenity not merely sexual but diabolical in intensity their muscles grew swollen it was a spiritual crisis far more than a physical the tribe was dying before our eyes this was their desperate last appeal the final tableau of their impotence the king looked subdued he leaned over and whispered you see my friend even in this there is something sacred something exalted it looks rather profane i quite agree but there is an element in it just a tiny element of holiness he rose and nodded good night to us and trudged lugubriously toward his royal bedchamber and then the dance disintegrated the glitter of limbs the clash of drums the mounting copulative rhythm and at last a great silence a real wilderness of silence the oil lamps began to splutter and go out one by one an intangible horror pervaded the mind the human semblance had completely vanished lost in the great crevasse of superstition all fear all ritual and mutilation their sexual core lay furiously in the darkness hawk s heads crocodile s heads hacking away at the prostrate bodies now we entered a great billowing valley with cliffs rising on either side vertical and cavernous like gothic facades this was the most idyllic place we had seen it was like a huge park wonderfully cool green and shadowy yet coruscating with colors birds butterflies beetles swarms of acacia and oleander we sat down under a low dark casuarina tree the aroma of the forest rippled about us the air was filled with hints of the past lingering rhythms tantalizing shadows was it italy or provence the illusion crumbled all around us we heard the thin dry squeak of the guinea fowl two huge turtles lumbered past pausing every few steps craning their wrinkled necks in a kind of senile indignation herds of buck and boar moved through the neighboring trees indolent utterly indifferent to our presence later after we had filled our in the distance once there was a sudden vibration in the air brilliant spools of green and gold coiled in light shot through the boughs they hovered then darted swift as the light itself everyone even the monkeys grew silent and watched there was something strangely thrilling in this electrical apparition which vanished as suddenly as it had come hummingbirds the only ones i ever saw in the african wood joshua brought us our cigarettes one for each of the men two for balibobotee oudange began to pull a thorn from the ball of his foot ndjoluva and osseladossa drew their fingers through their pubic hair it seemed they had picked up some crab lice in yalemba bambo with his pink shirt dangling about his birdlike legs like plumage was peering at joshua s butterflies and abulurubegan to tell tales in his low mournful voice well one day said abuluru with a poetical air an old woman it was early morning and her daughter s husband came down the path to drink at the well he knelt down beside the water and his loin cloth slipped to the ground and the old woman marveled at his shapeliness and vigor she felt the wicked old itch of desire so she cast a spell on her daughter and changed her to a wasp and that night she slipped softly into her daughter s bed the men listened gravely like children at school and now said nimbalimba the one about the buffalo please well said
common bond of human beings the sitting at the same table the sharing of the bread and salt now they were sitting opposite each other they ate a little more in symbol than in reality there was fresh bread i made it myself she said but it s getting hard to find flour now that s got no weevils in it there was no butter but honey and jam for the bread and a bottle of red wine and now like a child he began to talk this was and ann on riverside drive then the barriers had still been up now for the first time he talked of all those days he showed even the little scar of the fangs on his hand and the larger scars where he had slashed himself to apply the suction pump he told of his fear and of his flight and of the great loneliness that he had never quite dared face or imagine and as he talked she often said yes i know yes i remember that too tell me more as for her she had seen the catastrophe itself she had faced more than he had and yet he could see that she had come through better than he she talked little seeming to have no need but she drew him on as he talked with her he knew now at last that this at least as far as he was concerned was no mere casual meeting or passing moment in this lay all the future here and there and no one before had ever held him perhaps time had healed him more likely she herself was different yet she was a woman as the minutes slipped by he sensed that basic reality more and more with an intensity that made him tremble as between man and man the breaking of bread was the reality the shared table all the symbol needed but as between man and woman there must be still more in reality and in symbol a further sharing they realized suddenly that neither knew the other s name although each had been calling the dog princess ishenvood he said that was my mother s maiden name and so she stuck it on me bad was nt it everybody called me ish i m em she said emma that is of course ish and em we wo nt get very far writing poetry about that combination and she was another sharing and yet it was not the final one there were ways these things were done he had known men who could do them had seen them at work but he ish was not the right kind all those qualities which had permitted him to be by himself and survive through the bad days alone all those qualities now came up to work against him and he sensed too very deeply that they would be wrong the old methods had worked in the days when there were girls in every cocktail bar looking for adventure but now such methods were not right he knew and knew deeply at this time when the vast city stretched away empty in all directions outside of the windows and all the ways of the world had vanished and this woman had lived through all the catastrophe and the fear and the loneliness and now had come out on the other side still with courage in her eyes and affirmation and laughter for say some kind of marriage vows quakers could marry themselves why could nt others they could stand up together and face toward the east where the morning sun would rise and then he sensed that the mere babbling of words was in itself much more dishonest even than a straightforward feeling for the knee under the table he realized that he had been silent for what might have been a full minute she was looking across at him with level calm eyes and he knew that she read his thoughts in his embarrassment he rose suddenly to his feet upsetting the chair as he got up then the table between them had ceased to be a symbol joining them together and now held them apart he stepped from behind it and across toward her as she rose up too and then there was the softness of her body against his o song of songs thine eyes my love are gentle and the fullness of thy lips is soft and firm thy neck is the softness of thy breasts against me is like fine wool thy thighs are firm and strong like the cedars song of songs she had gone now into the inner room he sat still with breath and heart quick tense and waiting he had only one fear now in a world where there were no doctors and even no other women how could anyone risk the chance but she had gone he realized that she too in her great affirmation would consider this also and care for it o song of songs my love thy bed is fragrant as boughs of the pine tree and thy body is warm thou art ashtoreth thou art aphrodite that keepest the gate of love now my strength is upon me now the rivers are pent up now is my hour oh receive me in thine infinitude he lay quietly awake after she slept beside him and his thoughts rushed by him so fast that he could that was what she had said before earlier in the evening no matter what happened to the world it did not change the person and he remained what he had been yes that was the way though so much had happened and even though he might be deeply moved by that great experience yet still he was the observer the man who sat by the side watching what happened never quite losing himself in the experience the strangeness in the old world it might well

and falling hovering at our own marks then falling then rising who can set a mark or measure us they can not name my tides or measure me by the marks drawn on a wall i hover but let me tell you that if there is a call from the come over over you came young boy from the house to these woods with me running in them and you called out any name and i will never tell it and the woods held the name you called and trembled with the name and all the nests shook with it and berries swung with the calling like little bells and flowers rocked the name like listening faces turning their ears to hear the name and birds flushed up at the calling of the name and animals stopped where they were going and pricked their ears and heard and their ears held the name you called you walked and thought of all those killed by their love and lovers and you had none of all lost causes of hunters and explorers of all failures of men going after something and said the words that the mexicans say dios dios dios and wished and yearned for someone to lead you and to follow and you knew that i river wide p spread corruption and drouth the flaccid land of the dead and lain upon it and covered it with my sperm and brought up life from corruption that i crossed over my banks and went where there was nothing of me where i was not and left some of myself there but there is the inevitable return we are forever going out and coming in joining and abandoning alone and together once when you were swimming naked it happened for the first time to you in me christy stood on the bank and told you and berryben to jump in and touch my bottom and see who could come up to the top first and you were struggling to come up first rising rising rising faster faster when some marvelous thing that can happen to all of us happened to you wound up and burst and hurt you hurt you and you came up changed last to the top trembling and exhausted and sat down on my banks and tried to make you jump into me again you blamed it secretly on christy that he had made you feel like this and were afraid of him for it this was the way you learned what could happen to you but not why like a clock that could wind up and chime in you down there by me in these woods you once made up for what you never had played your fingers over my hairy rockmossand lay against my sandstone and ached and cramped and burned and i know what happened there just you hard against my rock and in your trousers all over you hot and running like glue you washed you inpmy waters and by my waters you lay down and wept and slept by me from then on you were aware of the feeling water could make you have we were lovers i had you rising and falling in me and you left something in me and it was mixed with my rich and i cast your sperm mixed in my spume and sediment onto the land the country of your beginnings and we made it rich what i taught you is that there must be a rising and a falling a bursting and a casting out all your family feared water would not cross it on bridges would not swim much in it but one drowned in it cross it love it be water you are river i am you and once in my greatest flood when i was swollen huge and throbbing with all my fluid i crept through charity and through bailey s pasture close to you and to your house and lay by you and by the house we were joined again and heard within it all the murmurings of the house by the shuttered window in the cellar in the loft in the kitchen by the map and sang my duet with the girl on the world and you slipped out to me ship in the bottle that i floated down and away onto the waters of the mapped world he looked at and became and also dropped some folner spangles and a stranger s photograph and a string of ruby beads and i received them all and mixed them in my substance in my stuff and i lay upon all the life of the people of the house left in the pasture the sawdust the bones of frozen and shot roma the cow the go to sleeppflowers the bitterweeds the lost doll the babybuggy i washed over all the footprints on the path of folner and you and berryben and christy and swimma saw malley peeking at me through the shutter and watched all of you sitting on the front gallery together fearing me heard the grinding of the cisternwheel and heard the splashing of the dropped bucket in the well and when i left the pasture you know what i left what you left in me and i brought back to you and to your pasture we in bottomland and pasture and i knew your agony with christy in my woods heard it and took the gift of birds you threw me christy s yoke and your yoke and my yoke and dissolvedthem in my substance when i rolled over onto the world in my agony and thought lost in charity that i might never find my way back home to the bottomlands i slept by you and in my agony i was reaching out to touch the world and i touched you when i touched the world i touched myself that i had put in you reach spread roll out onto
fort and sitting his horse looking over the fields bare with winter and ruined by neglect jeremiah suddenly saw them covered with corn and oats and rich pasturage and fat cattle on the pasture he felt the surge of energy in him which would make the vision real then he thought is this my end to be rich and easy and heavy as my best sow glutted on oak mast for the moment he was sick with self loathing then he saw again his father s swarthy face wearing the grim smile he used to smile when looking at a rich harvest and he thought again how he old beaumont would never have let a good field go to pieces or a fat pig stray and how old beaumont would have been great given his chance greater than colonel fort then jeremiah saw the truth he saw it clearly he would make the vision of old beaumont s revenge on all the great whose company he had not been able to join for old beaumont had a score to settle too just as rachel jordan had a score to settle it was a score with colonel fort one of the great to whom all things came easy fat land and power and reputation among men and the white ardent flesh of a young woman in a dark house it all fell into order for jeremiah beaumont his pleasure in his wife his waiting at the tavern for news his nocturnal brooding over his great purpose and his daylight energy in the fields and as the year wore on to harvest his imagination began to leap into the future beyond this harvest he would buy some merino sheep the kind that colonel fort had introduced into this section he would take out the timber on the creek for a new cornland and throw part of the old cornland to pasture to save it from wear and washing and as one sunday afternoon in august he came upon the place for a mill so the merinos the new cornland and the mill entered his calculations and his dreams he could see them before him what else could he see before him he saw rachel s face waiting for him at the end of every day speaking to him across the supper table musing in the dusk as they walked in the garden smiling up at him from a pillow from the midst of her unbound hair as he reached to snuff the candle did he still see colonel fort the solid bulk and sad face beyond the out thrust pistol pointed at him at jeremiah beaumont that body or his own lying on the ground by some ritual grove with the patch of red growing on the breast he says this much i could not forget my obligation and my manhood but circumstance taught me patience he had to be patient for in the late spring colonel fort had york he had gone as one of a committee of three to try to work out a system of postponement for debts owed in kentucky to banks and merchants in those cities wilkie barron had told jeremiah that for in june wilkie was back at his uncle s house on a visit as a note brought by a colored boy on a mule informed jeremiah one evening the next day jeremiah rode over to the barron place he found wilkie prosperous and full of affairs he was practicing law now in lexington under the wing of mr madison writing articles for skrogg s advocate speechifying for relief consorting with the great whose names now came easily to his tongue he was a little heavier than before but still lithe in carriage and quick in movement ills glistening boots creaked elegantly jeremiah gives us the word as he paced old barron s veranda and gestured with his cigar and expatiated on the wickedness and defect of public spirit and ignorance of law just exhibited by may a certain blair wilkie explained had owed one williams wilkie dwelt on the half cent the year before in in the august term of the bourbon county circuit court williams had received judgment against blair for the debt and costs immediately according to the replevin law of december duly passed by the legislature of the commonwealth of kentucky blair had gained relief by a replevin bond for two years but in november williams had moved to quash the replevin bond and collect on may judge clark had given a decision in favor of the creditor williams declaring that the replevin law of kentucky was void he had cited section x of article i of the united states constitution which forbade the passing of any ex post facto law or any law breaching the obligation of contract and had then declared that section xviii of article x of the kentucky constitution was in full agreement if judge clark s decision stood it wilkie declared by god it could not it is the law jeremiah said i remember the article in the kentucky constitution we could change it wilkie declared for what is our constitution for it is to protect the people of the state and when it does not protect it is not valid we will change it jeremiah pointed out that the constitution of the united states would remain p remain wilkie exclaimed it will remain where it belongs on a scrap of sheep s hide in washington but not here for this commonwealth has its dignity and shall make its own law and its people shall not starve he teetered on the edge of the veranda and gestured with his cigar he seemed not to be speaking so much to jeremiah as to the empty space of the yard which might be full of people people waitingand listening to

see he gets some decent clothes and then he anything you give him he ll hoard up like a squirrel lock it up in the old chest will gave him well let s give him a chance before we jump on him most likely he ll do the right thing if he wo nt we ll have to rig up ways to get around him for instance if he wo nt come up to eat at my place i ll have to send him something down to his shanty supper would suit me best that s when we have our heavy meal now on account of portius not getting home much at noon then i ll have one of the children free to send it down with but i do nt want you complaining it looks like you do nt have enough to feed him that s the way it was settled sayward herself went down to see him whenever she could it hurt something deep inside of her to come from her fine big house and see her father low she had to duck her head coming in his bed a bunk against one side no more than two could sit in here at one time unless they sat on the bunk why wo nt you stay with us in the house pap she d asked him but he never would one time he told her right where your place stands i shot the deer with the blue horn do you mind that ole blue horn it had a mess of points oh that was a handsomespot them days i kin see it yit with the big butts and creepers the way god almighty made it why it was sop thick around ar that buck never seed me and now all slashed off and gone to rack and ruin i kai nt look at it only thing left is the river and that do nt look like itself with the woods killed off and not near the water coming down that used to carry the supper basket he and massey hated still worse when their school mates asked is your grandfather still living down at the boat yard but the older girls said thank god the old man is nt in the house now that aunt cornelia is coming seldom if ever was it grandfather or grandpap no it was the octogenarian or the ancestor or the old man of the western waters or mama s old indianfighter and painter tracker portius was the one who put them up to it especially now that his fine blue stockingsister was coming from the bay state to visit them in ohio the first time sayward laid eyes on her she had to admit to wonder how she and her would get along portius had looked for his sister by boat that way she could nt have got to americus before june but one day late in may sayward and dezia were house cleaning when they saw the driver go out of his way but this time he drew up right in front of their house and sayward knew it must be for a good reason even before ned hanshaw got down from his seat and set a pile of traps on the sidewalk then he opened the coach door and a lady stepped down could that be portius s sister sayward thought she had always reckoned cornelia wheeler like mrs morrison tall and sweeping with a handsome face and gracious manner now this was a short plain woman more like aunt unity and with a face like the pope s her bonnet looked plainp and old style enough her hair drawn down severely on either side yet the stern way she held herself the costly look of her ribbed taffeta and the respectful way ned hanshaw treated her told you that this was a great lady and one more to reckon with than mrs morrison dezia fled upstairs to change her dress but sayward went right out as she was in her red waiting in the street with her traps and everybody in the stage and square a watching i m saird i reckon you re cornelia she said and gave the white fingers in the black mit a stout shake you are portius s wife his sister s eyes went over her distant as bay state mountain but sayward would nt explain that they had nt looked for her yet and that s why she was nt better dressed come right in i ll fetch your traps she said portius will be real surprised when he comes home and finds you re here she spoke friendly like sisters in law should but already she felt that cornelia wheeler looked down on her sayward thought she would nt mind too much the only thing portius s sister better not look down on was her children for they had wheeler blood a flowing in their veins the same as their aunt cornelia not so much perhaps but enough to let them stand up she need nt have fretted when dezia came down all dressed up her aunt cornelia gave her plenty of notice so this is dezia of whom i ve heard so much she said in her genteel bay state voice and held her cheek to be kissed which she had nt to sayward her keen blue yankee eyes surveyed the girl did your father ever tell you that you look like your grandmother wheeler child in everything i may say but your hair your grandmother wheeler used to brush her hair ten to fifteen minutes every morning and evening she was a very resourceful and determined woman she was determined to have beautiful hair and she did that sayward found later was her sister in law to a t she turned her sharp yankee eyes on every young wheeler that came around reminded them who they were and started to
wait for the election there was no longer any hope that they might do anything to influence it jackson s name was on the ballot and he might do very well or might not at any rate they had felt close to this matter before and now felt very distant from it inwardly the effect of the flight death breaking think of it as they might of tom kettle counterpointed the social catastrophe painfully and yet not hopelessly the night cameron had come home from barkley s office and sat late in the kitchen with margaret the fact of kettle s arrest like a single strain of bacteria that would work variously in various media had worked inwardly in them producing a kind of fever that seemed to burn clean enough to heal something in themselves just as in barkley s office and who knew where else the same inoculation had worked creating many relationstotal in themselves and yet linked to the other relations which out of some invisible corruption in the world s shape which kettle if he did nothing else opened with all its stink that night they had talked of the logic of the situation until all at once in their uncertainty they began talking of the possibility that kettle might kill himself margaret sat there then with her eyes perfectly blank her lips loosened with the strain of emotion and she had said i do nt think tom will he would have already if he had been going to would have before now that s a funny female statement i know it does nt make much sense does it that s what i believe too easy too damn easy we talk about his having somewhere to go and i keep remembering the way he said pleasure pleasure that hurt i ve never heard anybody say anything that way before that s about all he d have left if he pulled out of him put her face in her hands in a short coquettish gesture and when she raised her head again her eyes were glittering with something that was not sorrow nor happiness either she had blushed so the tips of her fingers left white spots on her cheeks where they had pressed andy this is funny shall i say it to you or not say you re not going to laugh at me and now oddly she began to look pale and frightened do nt laugh at me andy this is what i ve figured out from thinking about it all evening here i sat all evening thinking while you were gone talking to barkley men can go do things while women ca nt that makes a lot of difference but there s well i could nt help thinking that i understood tom kettle better when i found out for sure he was a homosexual because i m a woman i mean like a child that wants approval but it s the kind of trouble in some ways like the trouble a woman gets into you would nt know anything about that do nt you think maybe i do know better p he shook his head that s imagination barkley told me a lot of things tonight about kettle s past that i m trying to fit in all these years with the progressive movements that have been going to pieces under him it s got something to do with that some kind of hell with it all gesture no she said she came to him and put her arms around his head pulling his face against the wide yielding marsh soft curve of her belly she drew back to look at him i love you so andy my good andy then she pulled him to her again my dear dear andy come in the bedroom andy i want to tell you this light they lay on the bed with their flanks touching and holding each other s hands margaret s hand was damp in the palm andy do you know what it feels like to be really lonely yes he said but the single and empty word was not enough for her no you do nt know what i mean i think women know better and about tom the white curtains around the windows made a frame a little paler than the walls or the night and he watched this pale frame while she gathered her thoughts and went on you know they say homosexuals have female genes or something like that so they re part women and you re not one so you do nt understand i ll have to tell you do you believe me everybody has been lonely honey if you mean that homosexuals must be lonelier than other people i ll agree i do nt mean because of social pressures and so on before p as he lay there watching the curtains he heard her swallow hard andy did you have any girls while you were in the army he felt his pulse begin pounding but it was not with any fear for himself he knew from this beginning what would come his mouth felt dry he knew that she was crying once he said in texas it was nt anything that kind of thing does nt matter does nt matter you fool you fool you think because it s a war you get a dispensation like the jews and catholics to eat meat anytime and there s some kind of dispensation that says it does nt matter she made a fist of the hand he had been holding and struck gently again and again at his leg oh you big fool no wonder you ca nt understand tom kettle may not for you because you re a man and it really does nt i was going to tell you about something that happened to me yes he said i knew that he felt the spittle in his mouth becoming
without being too brutal an easy assignment the colonel said i ll skip the times the weather is cloudy and the place smoking the enemy with artillery and mortar s advises that s wants red to button up by s wants you to button up and use plenty of artillery white reports that they are in fair shape s informs that a company will swing around and tie in with b b company was stopped first by enemy action and stayed there of their own accord s is nt doing so good this is unofficial he wants more artillery but there is nt any more artillery you wanted combat for what i do nt know really why or really know why who wants true combat but here it is daughter on the telephone and later i will put in the sounds and smells and anecdotes about who was killed when and where if you want them i only want what you will tell me i ll tell you how it was the colonel said and general walter bedell smith does nt know how it was yet i have been so many times i m glad we do nt have to know him or the nylon smooth man the girl said we wo nt have to know them this side of hell the colonel assured her and i will have a detail guarding the gates of hell so that no such characters enter you sound like dante she said sleepily i am mister dante he said for the moment and for a while he was and he drew all the circles they were as unjust as dante s but he drew them i will skip the detailed part since you are justifiably and should be sleepy the colonel said he watched again the strange play of the light on the ceiling then he looked at the girl who was more beautiful than any girl that he had ever seen ever he had seen them come and go and they go faster flies they can go faster from fair beauty to the knocker s shop than any other animal he thought but i believe that this one could hold the pace and stay the course the dark ones last the best he thought and look at the bony structure in that face this one has a fine blood line too and she can go forever most of our own lovely beauties come from soda counters and they do not know their grandfather s last name unless maybe it was schultz or schlitz he thought this is the wrong attitude to take he said to himself since he did not wish to express any of these sentiments to the girl who would not like them anyway and was soundly sleepy now the way a cat is when it sleeps within itself sleep well my dearest lovely and i will just tell it for nothing the girl was asleep still holding his bad hand that he despised breathe when they are easily asleep the colonel told her all about it but he did not utter it so after i had the privilege of hearing general walter bedell smith explain the facility of the attack we made it there was the big red one who believed their own publicity there was the ninth which was a better division than we were there was us who had always done it when they asked for you to do it we had no time to read comic books and we had no time for practically nothing because we always moved before first light this is difficult and you have to throw away the big picture and be a division we wore a four leaf clover which meant nothing except among ourselves who all loved it and every time i ever see it the same thing happens in my inner guts some people thought that it was ivy but it was not it was a four leaf clover disguised as ivy the orders the first infantry division of the army of the united states and they and their calypso singing pro never let you forget it he was a nice guy and it was his job but you get fed up with horse shit unless you like the aroma or the taste i never liked it although i loved to walk through cow shit when i was a kid and feel it between my toes but horse shit bores you it bores me very rapidly and i can detect it at over one thousand yards so we attacked the three of us in line exactly where the germans wished us to attack we will not mention general walter bedell smith any further he is not the villain he only made the promises and explained how it would go there are no villains i presume in a democracy he was only just as wrong as hell period he added in his mind the patches had all been removed even as far back as the rear echelon the three he knew so well who were going to attack we were going to attack with the three of us in line and nothing in reserve i wo nt try to explain what that means daughter but it is nt any good and the place we were going to fight in which i had taken a good look at was going to be passchendaele with tree bursts i say that too much but i think it too much the poor bloody twenty eighth which was up on our right had been bogged down for some time and so there was pretty accurate information available about what conditions in those woods were going to be like i think we could conservatively describe them as unfavorable then we were ordered to commit one regiment before the attack started that means that the enemy will get at least one prisoner which makes all the taking off
well almost the best his name was undoubtedly jerome wildberg he really had wanted a boy to take over the business but had thought it would be cute to name her jere whatsa matta you did nt take me for a shicksa didja she was laughing at him it was waltz time now and the musicians who seemed to know all the new ones started up with will you remember jewish or not manley conceded she was something to look at and there was a quickness in her an imaginativeness a streak of non conformity a high keyed vitality new to him wait till he told the jewish welfare board dance in the arms of an indescribably beautiful jewess he was just about to draw her a little closer to him for the waltz when a short swarthy corporal muttered sorry lieutenant and took her away for an hour he was alternately ecstatic and glum as he cut in yielded cut in again in the minutes when he was forced to the sidelines he was startled to find how desperate he became he had to touch her again feel her lithe young body moving with his and marvel at the way her mind whipped unexpected words to her impudent tongue lieutenant you must nt monopolize me you sound like a bull mooser you see it s part of our job to remain in circulation i refuse to have you sound like a lending library book and anyway you re much too handsome why miss wildberg it s true you are nt by any chance just call me george gordon when we re alone i always have to be on my guard against handsome men men as good looking as francis x bushman but with something delicateand ethereal about them something poetic have you fallen in love with many like that oh hundreds i hate them all so do i now i fall out of love even quicker than i fall in that s why i know i should never be married but did nt you tell me you were married oh did i a thin faced private was in the way cutting in lieutenant manley retired to the sidelines in frustration it was like trying to hold a piece of quicksilver glittering in the palm of his hand but slipping away each time he tried to enclose it before he could cut back another soldier had taken his playing him the way she lid all the others look at her smiling up at that hebe well she was nt the only girl in paris god knows ah he had her back again now to get back to this mysterious husband of yours such a grim look m sieur you are nt an agent of the surete by any chance madame i have been shadowing you for months your name is not jere wildberg it is baroness hilda von fruhling spitzel horsthausenschaft operator xy of imperial german intelli gence ach ausgefundet jere cried she looked up into his face with her eyes wide open in theda bara intrigue they were dancing past the musicians play madelon again eddie she smiled at the pianist then she looked up at manley disarmingly i like dancing with you you re romantic how do you know that the way you put your cheek against open my eyes there are yours your yellow green cat eyes staring at me what are you looking at jere when you stare like that i m trying to look inside you to see what you really are you told me you were a sorceress but i did nt take you seriously never take me completely seriously but always take me a little seriously i ll remember that they took a good look at each other it was a look of both tenderness and appraisal what is your name lord byron he thought quickly mannie he answered mannie hallen stein she stopped to execute a little curtsy playfully but very prettily welcome to our humble chambers m lord he thought her adorable exquisite her bright eyes her quick ways an intruder attempting to cut in was rejected rashly come back later fella mannie morale not for my morale now what s all this nonsense about a husband her laugh was a little cry of triumph he did nt see anything to laugh about had there ever been a husband and did he write that stuff she had been spouting before well in a way in what way she had quoted from something she was working on and could nt a girl be married to her work what kind of work translating rimbaud she was going to do an english translation of une saison en enter it was such a magnificent poem no not magnificent terrible she d say it over to herself at night and feel almost too frightened to be alone it was that kind of a poem it was nt just the words the meaning but the sound the feeling but the job of translation drove her to the limits of madness it was so perfect in french so passionate so direct such a letdown dingy and blah she said what made you want to do it why do people try to climb mt everest the intruder was back and this time he would not be denied manley sulked as she was led away once as he waited on the sidelines she caught his eye over her partner s shoulder and stuck out her tongue again when his turn came he held her closer the connection was made and the currents of youth poured through them shyly his lips pressed through her hair and began to explore the soft warm lobe of her ear he could feel the involuntary fluttering in her the quickening into the darkness of her ruffled hair he whispereda mysterious incantation jere jere mannie she spoke softly yes yes he waited for the whispered words
aid he came safely to ground he put on his armor and strode to the airlock then changed his mind and went to but in view of the rugged and deserted field and the completely unknown terrain between the field and the town he decided to ride the creep instead this vehicle while slow could go literally anywhere it had a cigar shaped body of magnalloy it had big soft tough tires it had cleated tracks it had air and waterpropellers it had folding wings it had driving braking and steering jets it could traverse the deserts of mars the oceans and swamps of venus the crevassed glaciers of earth the jagged frigid surface of an iron asteroid and the cratered fluffy topography of the moon if not with equal speed at least with equal safety samms released the thing and drove it into the cargo lock noting mentally that he would have to exhaust the air of that lock into space before he again broke the inner seal the ramp slid back into the ship the cargo port closed here he was he did not know the palainians reaction to or attitude toward light it had not occurred to him while at pluto to ask and it might be important the landing lights of his vessel might already have done his cause irreparable harm he could drive by starlight if he had to but he needed light and he had not seen a single living or moving thing there was no evidence that there was a palainian within miles while he had known with his brain that palain would be dark he had expected to find buildings and traffic ground cars planes and at least a few space ships and not this vast nothingness if nothing else there must be a road from palain s principal city to its only spaceport but samms had not seen it from his vessel and he could not see it now at least he could not recognize it wherefore he clutched in the tractor drive and took off in a straight line toward town the going but the creep was built to stand up under punishment and its pilot s chair was sprung and cushioned to exactly the same degree hence while the course itself was infinitely worse than the smoothly paved approaches to rigelston samms found this trip much less bruising than the other had been approaching the village he dimmed his roadlights and slowed down at its edge he cut them entirely and inched his way forward by starlight alone what a town virgil samms had seen the inhabited places of almost every planet of civilization he had seen cities laid out in circles sectors ellipses triangles squares parallelopipeds practically every plan known to geometry he had seen structures of all shapes and sizes narrow skyscrapers vast spreading one stories polyhedra domes spheres semi cylinders and erect and inverted full and truncated cones and pyramids whatever the plan or the shapes of the component units however those inhabited places had without exception been understandable but this samms but the more he saw the less he grasped there was no plan no coherence or unity whatever it was as though a cosmic hand had flung a few hundreds of buildings of incredibly and senselessly varied shapes and sizes and architectures upon an otherwise empty plain and as though each structure had been allowed ever since to remain in whatever location and attitude it had chanced to fall here and there were jumbled piles of three or more utterly incongruous structures there were a few whose arrangement was almost orderly here and there were large irregularly shaped areas of bare untouched ground there were no streets at least nothing that the man could recognize as such samms headed the creep for one of those open areas palainians on pluto then stopped declutched the tracks set the brakes and killed the engines go slow fellow he advised himself then until you find out what a dexitroboper actually does while working at his trade do nt take chances of then that frigid blooded poison breathers were not strictly three dimensional but samms did know that he had actually seen things which he could not understand he and kinnison had discussed such occurrences calmly enough but the actuality was enough to shake even the mind of civilization s first lensman he did not need to be any closer anyway he had learned the palainians patterns well enough to lens them from a vastly greater distance than his present one this personal visit to palainopolis had been a gesture of friendliness not a necessity tallick kragzex he sent out the questing querying thought lensman virgil samms of sol three calling tallick and kragzex of palain seven kragzex acknowledging virgil samms a thought snapped back as diamond clear as precise as pilinipsi s had been is tallick here or anywhere on the planet he is here but he is emmfozing at the moment hewill join us presently damnation there it was again first dexitroboping please samms requested i fail to grasp the meaning of your thought so i perceive the fault is of course mine in not being able to attune my mind fully to yours do not take this please as any aspersion upon the character or strength of your own mind of course not i am the first tellurian you have met yes i have exchanged thoughts with one other palainian and the same difficulty existed i can neither understand nor first lensman palainians on pluto explain it but it is as though there are differences between us so fundamental that in some matters mutual comprehensionis in fact impossible a masterly summation and undoubtedly a true one this emmfozing then if i read correctly your race has only two sexes you read correctly i can not understand there is no close analogy however emmfozing has to do with reproduction i see his experience but also a
s high soprano tones straining his ears through the splashing of the oars that bore him toward biloxi ross could just make out some of the words before i ll be a slave the negroes sang i ll be buried in my grave and go home to my lord and be free amen ross whispered watching the smoke come up from the masts and cording amen and the augusta stood out to sea he got back to natchez on the afternoon of october th the very worst day he could have chosen to come home david and jennie and cathy were at the landing waiting for him in a landau with a pile of lap robes on the floor between the seats quick cathy said urgently lie down on the floor get under the robes ross stared at her why he said what s all this foolishness about cathy do as i say she snapped they ll kill you who ll kill me ross asked patiently whom do you want to hide me from the people jennie said ross today that old fool john brown raided harpers ferry in virginia in order to start a nationwide slave uprising the people are pretty excited and that man niven came back yesterday and found the quarters empty and you gone oh ross they might kill you they really might i see ross said then dave take the girls home look ross david began do as i say ross thundered i do nt sneak into town untie a blanket not even to save my life i knew he d say that cathy wept oh you big stupid jackass i do nt want you killed and i thought so too david said that s why had a nigger i borrowed from finiterre follow us on nancy llc s waiting over there you got a gun ross yes ross said i have a gun then you better ride like hell david said thanks dave sobbed you damned stupid fool have nt you brought me sorrow enough already reckon i have ross smiled maybe now you ll be rid ofine but i do nt want to be rid of you darling cathy wept i do nt wan but ross stopped her protests with his mouth then he was off running toward where the black waited with nancy he mounted and started up silver street but to their astonishment he rode very slowly oh my god cathy said he s too damned stubborn to even run david martin pulled at the reins and they started off after him maybe he s right cathy he said to come pounding through main at a gallop might attract too much attention ross had thought of that so he rode slowly quietly through the crowds nobody noticed him until he was almost great bulk and thundered there s one of the same kind there s that damned niggerloving fary right now the men started forward at a rush and ross pulled his revolver out and sat on nancy waiting i m not running men he said quietly i do nt want to kill any of you but by heaven i will if i have to they hesitated tony niven danced up and down with fury do nt let him buffalo you men he bellowed he ca nt kill us all instead of answering ross brought the revolver up and sent a shot crashing into the earth exactly between niven s widespread feet the bullet plowed up the earth splattering it over his boots no ross said pleasantly reining nancy to one side as he spoke until she moved in upon niven but i can kill you niven and it would be to move aside and let me through or you ll get it right where it ll do you the most good i can scarcely miss from here anthony niven stared at him his beet red face paling you win this time he said but i demand satisfaction you ll meet me at vidalia tomorrow gladly ross smiled i have the choice of weapons of course niven hesitated supposed the damned fool chooses rapiers he thought anthony niven was notorious for his clumsiness what s the matter tony some one in the crowd called scairt you have your choice he said huskily ross smiled at him bowie knives he said gently over a handkerchief at three paces our left arms to be bound together good day gentlemen tony niven stood there sweating he could see those flashing blades now feel pary damn him he thought is thin as a sidewinder and just as quick hell he d slash me to ribbons while i was getting set so thinking he jerked his revolver out and sent a bullet whining a scant half inch above ross s head then ross turned in the saddle and shot him the ball caught niven in the fleshy part of the right arm breaking the bone but out of pure terror he spun and fell so convincingly that all the others thought him dead they started shooting at ross he flattened himself out along nancy s neck and rode like hell while the men in the street scattered bolting toward their horses and a moment later they were pounding through main street after him slashing their horses flanks with whip and spur leaning forward standing in the stirrups ross came out of the town on the road that led toward moonrise and finiterre but that was a bad thing ior it and those who lived in it those men riding hell for leather behind him meant business they were not wasting their ammunition by trying the difficult feat of trying to shoot him from the saddle at a gallop no they meant to corner him like a rat and deal with him at their leisure he d have to turn off the road make a break for it through the brush lose himself among the trees here

i had a strange thought i was glad that mother would nt barbara laughed you underestimate mother she knew what war was one after another anne said what should we do if dick does nt get back barbara said he will it would be unfair if this family lost anyone else as in a hundred similar homes anne said i ll have the baby right here if you ll let me barbara laughed again let you whose home do you think it is anne laughed and said you do all the dishes then followed a curious barbarism of war in anxious america the names of the dead marines on tarawa were rushed onto the front pages of village newspapers there the pictures of dead heroes were displayed in a kind of public agony and many small towns that had predicted nothing but disaster for some young no good now proudly published his picture and nobody in the entire town gave a damn except that it made their village important the marines were intimately a part of the population the notice of death did not arrive for it was unprecedented to hold that any soldier could have owed allegiance to two different nations so anne neville lived a desperate fear afraid to call the american headquarters for she was not married to her marine she received an ugly fright one morning when an american staff car pulled up at the cottage a major in his middle thirties pompous and plump knocked at the door and announced himself as major harding is miss anne neville at home anne in whom pregnancy had started in earnest felt faint and was unable to speak but barbara standing beside her said this is my sister she s anne neville with extraordinary politeness the major found two chairs then sitting very straight on a third he said you must take this interviewvery seriously a great deal depends upon this interview please barbara said barbara the major stared at anne and asked your age she s thirty barbara said please the major said stiffly would miss anne neville please reply born ferrymead barbara responded the major carefully placed his pen in his notebook and said the record must be precise and in your sister s own words otherwise we shall be able to do nothing for her your father living no anne said cautiously his occupation when living a captain barbara exploded a captain in the royal navy the major wrote rapidly that is important that s going to help a great deal your religion church of england anne said i guess that s what we call episcopalian the major said i m baptist myself you girls lived here for some time thirty years no look miss neville i do nt like this any more than you do besides i m asking your sister would your minister be willing to swear that you were of good christian reputation yes anne said quietly the major sighed and smiled at the sisters that s that dreadful questions but i m going to break a confidence and say right out that you re as good as married what do you mean anne asked miss neville the major said rising and extending his hand in ten minutes i m going to cable noumea and recommend without qualification your marriage to lieutenant bates and in the meantime the american government wants to give you this present anne unfolded the parcel and read the book s title w p a guide to oklahoma what s this she asked if you re going to live in oklahoma we ll be prepared when you get there and tomorrow night you re invited to the young eagles club the what barbara asked but the major was already in his good bye spiel i think america is very lucky getting a fine good looking girl like you yes sir rules or no rules i m telling you now you re practically an american miss neville then maybe you could help us barbara asked hesitatingly at your service once you pass the investigation we ll do anything within reason we want you to like america anne s future husband lieutenant bates he s on tarawa the pompousness and the major ness evaporated and harding banged his leg oh damn it he groaned why wo nt they let us have those lists is there any way you could find out no he snapped you d think we had let us have the lists is there anything we might do barbara asked not a damn thing the major sighed then suddenly he jammed his hat on his head and asked is that the phone there on the corner yes barbara said leading him to the bright red kiosk major harding pushed his way in jangled the hook and stuck his head out the door how do you work these damned gook phones he asked barbara laughed and said they re difficult then she showed him how to deposit the pennies and listened as he stormed at headquarters about the casualty lists from tarawa damn it she heard him shout these are fine girls the one i interviewed this morning is as fine as any american girl you d ever meet she s got a right to know he slammed the receiver and said i m disgusted i was what red tape was if you hear please let us know let you know sister i m going to cable halsey direct before he said good bye to anne he whispered to barbara this damned routine is getting me down checking on marriages when you are nt sure there s ever going to be one have you met this situation before barbara asked he looked down at her with the worn out patience of a businessman trying to explain to his wife what had happened at the office have i met it lady the last four marriages i ve investigated we do

and listen to all this bernice mrs foreman said quietly i think the stew is almost done look at it bernice please do nt leave your skates and jumping rope in the middle of the floor where anyone can trip over them mrs foreman and agnes were talking more quietly now she was in bernice s class last term i do nt know how a girl that age could possibly she s fourteen mrs foreman sighed and oscar s sixteen i to court he did agnes she s just trying to humiliate us leave her alone god knows popa has nt one cent to give her there was a pause before mrs foreman spoke again i wish we could send him away to one of those schools he s getting worse every day i do nt think he ll graduate at the end of the month and he stays out so late and wo nt mind anything wrong mama no i just felt dizzy why do nt you lie down agnes voice was so quiet now they had nt even mentioned the ink besides popa will be home soon i want to be on my feet when he comes in agnes coin spilled ink all over his suit at school today he had to empty ink from one of those big bottles into a small well now it was coming he began to nt cry when agnes slapped him teachers should nt send a boy that age after ink those bottles are so awkward he was nt going to get a slap after all she was thinking about the problem of oscar and ink was nothing when it came to thinking about oscar in a way he was sorry because he was prepared to take the punishment and now he d have to wait until popa came home and he was sure to notice even if they did nt say one word agnes slap was nothing to popa s strap funny thing that oscar never got a whipping maybe because he was named after popa oscar emerson foreman junior ppo pa liked to call him by the whole name each time it sounded like a roll call in school a lot of first names run together maybe oscar was too strong for popa no popa was nt afraid of anything or anybody not even mr courtland and he worked for him coin had heard his supper for sending him to long island for strawberries or something from a hothouse right in the middle of winter or that night he had to go to washington unexpectedly and was forced to postpone his installation as president of the society of the sons of virginia did popa curse then he must ve been mad hell and damn he had snapped out because of mr courtland popa did nt fear oscar coin glanced up suddenly at the ceiling and was sure he saw oscar s face just as plain or was it a bulldog closing his eyes he counted to seventeen opened them again yes that was his brother all right and he was laughing down at him brown and gray coin gaped back real hard but oscar would nt stop laughing so he crossed his eyes to the ceiling with glee and stuck his tongue out for good measure dear heavenly father make us truly grateful for this food which we are about to receive for the nourishment of our bodies for the name of thy son christ jesus who died on the cross that we might live amen mr foreman invariably said grace in megaphone tones to coin he sounded like he was praying before the whole sundaypschool or wanted mrs renaldo upstairs to hear or the bernsteins across the airshaft to bow their heads with agnes and mama and woody and bernice and sometimesoscar the loud deep tobacco voice signified prayer over more than a simple stew the comport seemed to grow large enough to include fried chicken corn on the cob candied sweets rice ice cream walnut cake and all the crisp eager amen caused every sort of good juice to flow in his mouth his father prayed over mountains of food and every kind was coin s favorite the gaslight spreading shadows and highlights around the room helped reinforce other illusions too for instance popa s diploma from wayland seminary was a window in the misty corner near the kitchen door reflecting wrinkled gaslights like three little with the ugly red and purple flowers in a green field faded into mysterious owl forests the picture of the last judgment above the buffet appreciated the prayer and christ s outstretched hands suffered little children to come unto him instead of striking at the wicked in their downward fall momps his voice had a little bit of ha ha in it where s the napkins he reared back in his chair smiling of course they did nt have any but popa seemed to think so and that mama was just too stingy to use them they re in the same place popa bernice fetch the napkins bernice went to the buffet and took nothing out of the top drawer and handed each one some air shaped like a napkin coin thought that was the biggest joke as mr foreman lifted the covering to the comport and sniffed lima bean stew woody leaned over to coin and whispered beans beans the musical fruit nobody heard for mr foreman s mouth worked out large fat ohs and as momps he called this smells mighty tempting might be forced to take a second helping yes sir re bob i might be forced to do that steam smoked his small black hedge of mustache the two boys still giggled over their rhyme and bernice joined them after repeating yes sir re bob in what she thought was a deep voice her upper teeth thrust forward catching the light gave her an extra lip white and

so far outside the normal it was capable of being a failure and a mistake for a moment ericson wondered if at a later date when gregg had forgotten the worst of this matter he might translate the occasion into different terms perhaps boasting cheekily in the mess decks trouble not me the skipper gave me a tot of whisky and told me to come back any time but no it would nor be like that the giving of the whisky seemed to surprise gregg into an effort of control as he sipped it looking round the cabin and out through the sunlit porthole his mouth and face firmed again and he prepared to go on what he had said and what he had still to say was desolate but not too desolate for ordered speech it was possible he had thought that his wife might be at though she had said nothing about going she was in the mood for impulsive action so to edgware he went by bus only to draw another blank she was nt there and she had nt been there for weeks i could see her mother thought it was funny but i was nt answering any questions then i went to see my pal the one that wrote the letter but he d gone back after his leave and they did nt know anything so i left it and went home again he had been alone in the empty silent house for a week as he dismissed it thus in a single sentence lricson tried to visualize what it must have been like the waiting the loneliness the suspicion the knowledge of betrayal i had to stay sir in case she came back he said and ericson could not for pity deny the claim i d have gone to look there was the whole of london and then i got an idea i should have thought of it before there was a married friend of hers woman i never cared for over the other side of london down white city way i thought she might be staying there so i went over and asked at the house she said the wife had been there a few days back but had gone away again she did nt know where the story was pouring out now unchecked by any reserve in the silent cabin the words and sentences clumsy and ill formed yet flowed with an eloquent readiness towardstheir cruel end i thought she was telling lies there was something in the way she looked so i hung about a bit watching for the car and then i turned into the first pub i came to for a pint and something to eat and there they were the two of them sitting she was laughing and then she looked up and said look who s here ericson thought he was going to stop as he had stopped many times before but the whisky had done its work or perhaps it was the story itself which could not be delayed at so crucial a point i asked what she was doing there instead of being at home gregg went on immediately and she said there was no harm in having a drink then i said where ve you been the last week and she said staying with else that s this woman i said i was nt going to stand for it and the man said what you need is a drink i said i do nt want a drink from you if this goes on i m going to see about a divorce i did nt really mean it i just wanted to give him a scare he i said how about you coming down the stairs that night and he said i was just saying good night to mrs gregg it was quite inno the cruel sea i i grapplingcent and then he winked at her and she laughed like a like a rotten tart what an accurate description thought ericson how can he want her now how can he feel anything but hatred and disgust but in gregg s voice there was neither of these when he said rotten tart he was not condemning he was mourning what he and she had lost there was no trace of rationality in it no balancing of right and wrong there was simply the incalculable instinct of love of what people feel or feel that they should feel when they undertaketo bind themselves to other people even now it seemed gregg did not question the validity of that binding the bargain might be bad this sprang from love a word in a book a scene in a film a foolish core of determination in a man s brain gregg was continuing with quiet assurance i was going to say something to him about that sir but then he said you need nt worry anyway i m off to the states next week big buying job and the wife said first i ve heard of it walter when are you going and he said thursday i ll come round to say good bye and i said like hell you will you do nt come near the house again it was funny sir he did nt try to argue the toss about that he just said i lave it your own way then i think what i said about the divorce must have rattled him a bit but perhaps he d had enough of it anyway then he stood up see you again one of these days and she said very surprised do you mean good bye walter and he walked off and by and by she started crying and i took her home at that gregg paused and looked at ericson as if judging how he would receive what he was going to say next he was near the end now and he must in spite of his
honor of your excellency s letters and am sorry to find that a man of such high rank should descend so far as to use intelligences which he confesses came to him in an indirect way british admirals are responsible to none but their sovereign and their country and were never known to insult an open and declared enemy but and traitors and rebels to their king deserve no consideration and none shall they ever meet with at my hands i must again repeat to your excellency that i can no longer permit flags of truce to pass between the king my master s islands and those of the french this communication i am determined to prevent and i have given orders to all my cruisers to seize and detain all flags of truce but such as general vaughn and myself may be honoured with from you without exception it was signed g b rodney barney looked up this spoils your intelligence system he could nt help smiling the marquis was in no smiling mood that sanctimonious devil he said has refused to exchange prisoners and the french merchants on stasia according to him they come under these he tapped the letter perfidious people i have replied i have replied thus said the marquis calming down a little writing i am satisfied that a british admiral ought to be responsible to his king and country to both i owe reprisals they shall be forthcoming you have set the example and i shall pursue it he looked up at barney over the letter to punctuate this he went on i repeat once more that you may act as you please towards our flags of truce to quiet your apprehensions on that score i shall send no more in the future the interpretations of our sentiments shall be our cannon very much to the point m lord barney said crossing long legs from outside in the gardens came the sound of hammering as the construction of a dance floor under the palms went on six hundred people had been invited to a reception for the comte de grasse and his officers tonight the marquis laid the letter down you will miss the festivities sir he said i am sorry again there can be no possible doubt but that francois was caught on stasia and now lurks somewhere in the hills with the americans mr ross in his last communication the marquis grimaced supposed there to be from three to four hundred of them but they surrender daily starved feverish rodney has arrested curyon and gouvernier and sent them as prisoners of state to england for treasonable trading with the enemy all goods including those of french merchants have been confiscated the food is even doled out to each household when they are deported they may take only household goods and household slaves with them rodney is also after the englishmen who became dutch burghers to enjoy the trading air of stasia the marquis smiled all canoes have to be drawn up on the beaches before dark fort oranje now boasts forty ten pounders batteries are being constructed we re not quite sure where i do nt wonder rodney the marquis said we must keep communications open the situation now is that we can watch hood and his fleet since they retreated to st lucia we must devise means to watch stasia i have requested captain connor to attend us he waits the marquis crossed the floor and opened a door barney waited for the sight of the man who was to accompany him on his next mission connor was irish with freckles and hazel eyes a scar marked one cheek adventurer and professional soldier he commanded the marquis garrison of some five hundred men he wore a resplendent uniform dark blue with red facings with a line of white down neat trouser leg captain connor barney said bowing as soon as you two have said hello we will get down to business the marquis said and went over to the wall and unrolled a magnificent map of the islands which covered almost one whole wall barney till the three of them stood in front of it the marquis with a long wand in hand looked at both of them and smiled with satisfaction you are two aces i have against the british sirs he said and his smile was delighted now attendez here are we the marquis loved his maps and he loved strategy with machiavellian fervor he was enjoying himself this morning it was with some regret he realized his correspondence with rodney was at an end however the bullets would come next as he had promised here are we and de grasse and twenty some ships of the line besides my four frigates here is hood close he pointed to st lucia hood is kept under surveillance at all times that surveillance was good barney knew good and accurate it was going to allow him to proceed with assurance that he was not bearding hood and the went on here is stasia saba and st martin a stone s throw from st kitts and nevis in british hands we watch from guadeloupe one moment connor said once we take stasia back we are free to include st kitts and nevis in the same bundle my lord they go together later said the marquis then he said you understand i have no say he gestured as to the doings of the fleet and le comte de grasse i tell you confidentially we must do all this out here in the islands ourselves the fleet serves as a balance wheel only a big one said barney and connor nodded may i smoke m lord he asked and knowing the answer would be in the affirmative got out his pipe he filled it abstractedly he said the damage done by the yanks to now the regiments which general vaughn is leaving on stasia
d talk to him he d imagined that meeting her would change his life and this had all happened when his old man had been hitting the bottle heavily in those days he d often cowered in fear of his father and he d sometimes blamed his mother for not protecting him this was all so far away now it was gone he was bringing it back in memory recreating it in words all the fears and hopes all that hungering and dreaming for love little philip would have his own boyhood he would try to make it different from his different from his own lost and betrayed past bernard sometimes i think you do nt care for anyone but yourself elizabeth said in great irritation doing my work is nt a matter of this quarrel seemed so childish that he could nt respond to elizabeth s anger it was a beautiful peaceful night and they were taking a walk along seventy first people were strolling about lazily there was really nothing for them to quarrel over their baby was home asleep and if he needed anything mr whelan was there to take care of him bernard felt good he wanted to wander about with elizabeth to make the most of this aimless walk to absorb the evening but here they were quarreling and he did nt know what it was all about you re always talking about your work and having to work and of course i want you to and i let you work but what about me honey you know i love you bernard carr you know you just did nt want to go out for a drive with my father and mother you know it just as sure as you know there s not true he answered it is and you know it is and you were mean mean and selfish tonight but i asked you and you said it was all right if i did nt come along now you want to fight with me anyway someone had to stay home with the baby we could have taken the baby along an elderly couple turned to stare at them and bernard was embarrassed honey please let s drop it it s a beautiful night let s enjoy it and cut out this idiotic quarreling father and mother have been very nice to both of us i did nt do anything to them they did nt seem to mind my staying home well i just happen to know that they did did they say anything no they never talk about you except to praise you even after what you did and she was telling me how i should see topit that you ate the right food so you d be healthy and you act as if you did nt like my father i do nt dislike him you are nt even careful and tactful in what you say to him when was i tactless and why in hell do i always have to be tactful let others be tactful sometimes instead of my always sparing their ideas and feelings and prejudices let them consider mine if someone else expresses ideas i do nt like why should nt i tell them what i think instead of consideringwhether my ideas will make them angry i never knew you could be so mean she seemed about to burst into tears and this is the way you treat me when i ask you to take me out for a walk well i am taking you out for a walk yes but you re me i m not fighting with you i did nt start it you did people are looking at us you do nt want to scandalize the neighborhood do you bernard carr i hate you they turned the corner at jeffery avenue i would nt have said a thing if you d only acted just a little different with mother and father honey this is silly it s idiotic let s stop it and but bernard you were nasty to me no more than you were to me he determined not to become annoyed bernard even though i am your wife i do nt think you think i m important maybe you do nt think anyone is important just your work he took her and kissed her she melted with pleasure you kissed me on jeffery avenue she said coyly her on toward jackson park laughing together they were sitting on bernard s coat rumpled and silent elizabeth lay with her head on his shoulder though he felt at peace with the world at the same time he felt disillusioned he thought of death if it could come at such a time as this in a sweetness of fatigue and spent emotions a slow and painless exhaustion here where he d dreamed of love as a boy here and now when the world was so beautiful and peaceful the blue sky was lavish with stars and trees darkness a blue gray mist and moonlight soft winds from lake michigan playing on the leaves and running so caressingly through his hair they had come here to his special spot in jackson park they had kissed and loved and abandoned themselves to each other and they had been as close and as ecstatic as it was possible to be and now they sat close together silent and sleepy there was no more than this under the stars and then to sit under these same stars and with resignation to know that there was no more this this was all there could be and this too was the real content of those boyhood dreams elizabeth breathing softly with her head on his shoulder had given him what he d wanted from elsie cavanagh she had made his boyhood dreams come true almost all his dreams had come true he d found the limit of his dreams this was it this tired

said mrs joy shutting her eyes again and father rushton watched watched watched and louisa was holding a conversation in which she did nt propose to be interrupted for the world she was goading tom bernstein and the priest into heady discussions of the church the theater and the welfare state the frivolity of her profession as buyer for rich and silly women had goaded her new england conscience into an excessive concern for the welfare of people she did nt know and would nt like if she did know since they were unwashed and poorly dressed a crime in louisa s professional eyes the more louisa s salary at the department store went up the more she felt spurred to david had been watching the rancor between tom bernstein and louisa ebb and flow that soured understanding between two ex lovers louisa was just beyond her bloom he guessed that five years ago she must have been to tom a musky mistress with all the libertine jollity that is usually imputed to an artist s model torn duckie louisa said do nt you ever tire of being sententious the young man has something to say said father rushton well father when you ve been listening to his blather for years as i have but tom s studied baritone drawled on like an actor fearful of having his cue jumped i appeal to you padre what gets me about the church is that it s such damn good theater i understand that damn pis not offensive to catholics as long as it does nt have for subject the deity the mass is the greatest drama in the world my son but it s so his subject he was wearing a lapelless jacket of fawn colored suede he had an ascot with a stickpin at his throat his shoes were also of suede well what i mean is the church has provided herself with a first rate scenario of course she ought to have she s had rehearsal time enough unlike most broadway shows what with rising production costs and look at the cast of characters padre the son of god himself i believe that s the christian interpretation of jesus christ mrs murray and mrs joy as they had been taught to do bowed their heads with father rushton and three priests in gothic vestments and gregorian showtunes that have lasted six hundred years and pretty choirboys in red and white and best of all an audience that packs the house every sunday morning with a willing suspension of their disbelief which is something you rarely get in the theater yes sir god the for a longer run father rushton may find your analogy embarrassingly secular said louisa winking at david not too much so my daughter holy mother church seizes on any metaphor that will serve to explain her message to generation after generation of converts who s talking of converts louisa laughed
she brought them obediently and sherry pulled the cork from steaming strong black coffee he sniffed at the aroma as he lifted the cup hey this hits the spot on a wet night how about you kid you like some coffee or a beer or something no i do nt want nothin tude said she watched him as he drank and then held the thick white cup between his hands for a moment before he drank again she moved off a little lighting a cigarette and putting it down smoothing quickly and carefully at her hair where it was combed up sleek over the back of her head sherry added more coffee and then brandy to his cup and sampledit again you know this is really nice he said in the silence coming home and finding you up and having something to eat like this why you wanta say that she said you kiddin me or somep n i m not kidding stared at him for a moment silently and then moved away with her strange dawdling walk tidying the pile of magazines on the library table again automatically and tweaking and straightening at the dusty drapes come on sit down he said i ll let you try a slug of my coffee if you want to she did not answer him prowling on around the room her face tense and preoccupied sherry did not speak again but he watched her when his cup was empty he replenished it from the bottle and the coffee pot and then he leaned back in the chair loosening his tie and shirt collar settling down so that his body was slouched and comfortable while the rain pattered against the windows okay what s the pitch he said finally his voice soft what you got on your mind anyway tude stopped still glancing at him quickly over her shoulder and then away what you may as well get it over with and relax what was all this for anyway tude turned and stood for a moment her eyes wide open her body tensing and gathering together she sucked in a great breath of air and then came to him running flinging herself upon him her body pressing and caressing and urging her arms tight over his shoulders sherry sat motionless his hands grasping into the chair arms aw come on and love me honey she whispered gim me a little loving igo crazy livin here with you unless you gim me some lovin honey sherry stood up slowly and she came with him her hands clasped tightly at the back of his neck her body stretched up and rhythmically and insistently pushing against his her head flung back eyes closed and mouth moist and open he looked down into her face and then unhurriedly he reached up holding to her wrists and she began to tremble her eyes still closed aw come on honey please honey he let her go abruptly knocking against the flimsy card table so that all the little flowers trembled in the water glass he walked across the room to the dark windows and the falling rain outside and from behind him tude said her voice high and sharp what s the matter with you you liked me all right that time we did it did nt you sherry did not answer her he stood for a time and when he turned finally his face was tired his eyes looked inward his smile wry and self mocking tude was sitting in the chair that he had left her body sagging and apathetic now her elaborate hair do carelessly dropped forward between her two supporting hands whatever it is you want you better try some other way sherry said it s he came to the table slowly reaching for cigarettes and he spoke again without looking at her what were you really after anyway you still bound i ll take you to a doctor is that it she did not seem to hear him and after a moment he said okay kid i m sick and tired of it you listen to what i m gon na say for a minute he hesitated his face frowning and when he went on he spoke more rapidly his voice a little strained you know what fay was sick with and the way she died of it well fay had a an abortion once see christ they do nt nobody know about those things but she always claimed it was having that abortion that time that made her get sick the way she did that s what fay always thought so that s all there is to it that s the story i had my head full of fay and i had my head full of that or you would nt have that certificate you got now that s the whole story and now i m sick and tired of it and i say the hell with it if you want it so bad as all this it s your own business i have nt been pushing you around just for the fun of it i ll take you to a doc tomorrow you hear what i m telling you leave me alone tude said shut up and leave me alone he reached down then his fingers digging hard into her shoulder did you hear what i said i said i ll take you to see a doctor tomorrow you can go to a doctor and get fixed up the way you been yapping to do day in and day out around here if you want it so bad as all this i ll take you tomorrow me alone why ca nt you i do nt want to go to no doctor sherry stood transfixed his hand falling away from her shoulder what you mean you do nt want to go to a doctor she looked up at him for an instant her eyes
in the hammock and half out of it andrew tortured a beetle in the grass and fretfully murmured obscenities a squirrel sassed him from the crotch of the tulip tree and beth three feet away insolently sat with her back to him nothing could make him feel worse when he was feeling bad to start with than the insult of a cat he hated them all and most of all he hated this black bug whose legs he slowly amputated between the dirty words he talked as he worked to an imaginary twin who sat on the grass at the base of the tree this interested and adventitious homunculus although it was his twin was nevertheless much younger than he and surpassingly ignorant when i have finished killing charles i ll take you downtown he said to it how would you like to eatpan alewife at the smoke house what is an alewife why it s a sort of herring okay just will be about the only chance i ll have because day after tomorrow i ll be too busy to bother with you you mean because day after tomorrow you re going eeling with victor asked the twin eeling he exclaimed my god you do nt know anything do you do you think i d catch an eel on purpose the poor kid quickly changed the subject when will the funeral be he asked ten in the morning probably replied andrew depending on the tide why depending on the tide because we have to go clamming right afterward it was mid morning but the dew was not yet dry in the shade of the elms drops of it depended like beads from a spider web that was strung from tree to tree andrew had been awake since daybreak stirred out of sleep by two wrens that had held a shrill colloquy in the vine over with the strong fresh breeze on his face he had seen his cousin s lamp go off for a moment he was so thrilled to think of the two of them awake in the sleeping house at five in the morning that he had thought of knocking on her door and asking her to go for a swim but he knew that the lake would be cold and anyhow there was something too intimate and isolated about this hour of the day alone with her in the aboriginal morning with nothing else to distract her she might read his criminal mind she had not come down to the dining room while he and the twins were eating their breakfast and her tray which usually went up at half past seven had not gone up by the time he left the house at nearly nine there was a funny feeling in the house the maids and the twins were quiet and no one seemed able to settle down to anything it was always that way whenever cousin katharine s routine was all night he told his twin all night long she was reading my mind maybe she just turned on the light for a minute suggested the twin listen he said to this impudent doubting thomas listen to me i m boss around here i said cousin katharine stayed up all night and that s what she did no ifs buts or maybes the twin blubbered at the scolding and more kindly andrew said come on half pint charles smithwicked is deader than a door nail he had decided to go down to the village because of something harriet had said the night before when they were playing three handed bridge she had said he should be ashamed of himself for behaving like a baby he could nt fool her she said he was nt reading in the hammock he was nt doing anything but pretending it was a cradle she thought that anyone should have more pride than to advertise to the resources he had flung down his cards and told her to go to hell but she was right and he was ashamed and all night long he had pitched and tossed and pummeled his pillow and deranged the bedding it took great courage to leave the hammock and to expose himself to the town his mouth was as dry and his heart was as erratic as it always was when he had to be in any kind of play or exhibition it was like a dream of going to school in his underwear but he steeled himself he got up full of determination to honor who called out from the drawing room to ask him where he was going he replied i ve got some errands to run downstreet she saved his life then for in fact he had no errands at all but she asked him to take the morning letters to the post office there were five altogether the three they had written to their parents andrew having nothing to say health of the animals all of whom were well and two in cousin katharine s hand one to the shipleys and the other to aunt alma when he was out of sight of the house he held these last two up to the light but the letter paper was thick and he could not make out a word he would have given much to know what she had written about him he idled down the road and through the town keeping up appearances by smiling to himself and from time to time if he passed anyone faking a chuckle he paused to look at an unfamiliar skiff tied up at the small pier and to speculate on its owner and its purpose and to deduce that it had sailed in from bingham bay on the early wind it occurred to him to board it and get a lift to the docks to hunt for congreve smithwick and reclaim his knife with which to cut out charles s heart but
until she was of no use any more then he would throw her out the local constable would the knife did not bother him he knew about that the first thing he did when they stopped in a private place between a stone wall and a fringe of cedars was to jerk the purse from her hand and throw it over the wall that took care of the knife but he did nt know about himself because in all his life he had never been in love with a woman he thought he only meant to punish her after two slashes the quirt was not enough he dropped it on the ground and used his fists his breathing came out in squealing whines catherine did her best not to fall into panic she tried to duck his threshing fists or at least to make them ineffective but at last fear overcame her and she tried to run he leaped at her and brought her down and by then his fists were not enough his frantic hand found a stone on the ground and his cold control was burst through with a red roaring wave he listened for her heartbeat and could hear nothing over the thumping of his own two complete and separate thoughts ran in his mind one said have to bury her have to dig a hole and put her in it and the other cried like a child i ca nt stand it could nt bear to touch her then the sickness that follows rage overwhelmed him he ran from the place leaving his suitcase leaving the quirt leaving the oak box of money he blundered away in the dusk wondering only where he could hide his sickness for a while no question was ever asked of him after a time of sickness to which his wife ministered tenderly he went back to his business and never again let the insanity of love come near him a man who ca nt east of eden learn from experience is a fool he said always afterward he had a kind of fearful respect for himself he had never known that had not killed catherine was an accident every blow had been intended to crush her she was a long time unconscious and a long time half conscious she realized her arm was broken and that she must find help if she wanted to live wanting to live forced her to drag herself along the dark road looking for help she turned in at a gate and almost made the steps of the house before she fainted the roosters were crowing in the chickenhouse and a gray rim of dawn lay on the east chapter when two men live together they usually maintain a kind of shabby neatness out of incipient rage at each other two men alone are constantly on the verge of fighting and they know it adam trask had not been home long before the tensions began to build up the brothers saw too much of each other and not enough of anyone else for a few months they were busy getting cyrus s money in order and out at interest they traveled together to washington to an iron star with seal and a hole on the top in which to insert the stick for a little flag on decoration day the brothers stood by the grave a long time then they went away and they did nt mention cyrus if cyrus had been dishonest he had done it well no one asked questions about the money but the subject was on charles mind back on the farm adam asked him why do nt you buy some new clothes you re a rich man you act like you re afraid to spend a penny i am said charles why i might have to give it back still harping on that if there was anything wrong do nt you think we d have heard about it by now i do nt know said charles d rather not talk about it but that night he brought up the subject again there about the money yes about the money if you make that much money there s bound to be a mess how do you mean well papers and account books and bills of sale notes figuring east of eden well we went through father s things and there was nt none of that maybe he burned it up maybe he did said charles the brothers lived by a routine established by charles and he never varied it charles awakened on the stroke of four thirty as surely as though the brass pendulum of the clock had nudged him he was awake in fact a split second before four thirty his eyes were open and had blinked once before the high gong struck for a moment he lay still looking up into the darkness and scratching his stomach then he reached to the table beside his bed and his hand fell exactly on the block of sulphur matches lying there on the side of the block the sulphur burned its little blue bead before the wood caught charles lighted the candle beside his bed he threw back his blanket and got up he wore long gray underwear that bagged over his knees and hung loose around his ankles yawning he went to the door opened it and called half past four adam time to get up wake up adam s voice was muffled do nt you ever forget it s time to get up charles slipped his legs into his pants and hunched them up over his hips you do nt have to get up he said you re a rich man you can lay in bed all day so are you but we still get up before daylight you do nt have to get up charles repeated but if you re going to farm you d better farm buy
the gun in his hand i took a few steps forward walking blindly now unthinking yet my mind registering it all vividly across and starting up on the curb and seeing clifton up closer now lying in the same position on his side a huge wetness growing on his shirt and i could nt set my foot down cars sailed step that would raise me up to the walk i stood there one leg in the street and the other raised above the curb hearing whistles screeching and looked toward the library to see two cops coming on in a lunging big bellied run i looked back to clifton the cop was waving me away with his gun sounding like a boy with a changing voice get back on the other side he said he was the cop that i d passed on forty third a few minutes before my mouth was dry he s a friend of mine i want to help i said finally stepping upon the curb he do nt need no help junior get across that street the cop s hair hung on the sides of his face his uniform was dirty and i watched him without emotion hesitated hearing the sound of footfalls approaching everything seemed slowed down a pool formed slowly on the walk the cop looked at me curiously above in the park i could hear the furious flapping of wings on my neck the pressure of eyes i turned a round headed apple cheeked boy with thickly freckled nose and slavic eyes leaned over the fence of the park above and now as he saw me turn he shrilled something to someone behind him his fact lighting up with ecstasy what does it mean i wondered turning back to that to which i did not wish to turn there were three cops now one watching the crowd and the others looking at clifton the first cop had his cap on again look junior he said very clearly i had enough trouble for today you going to get on across that street i opened my mouth but nothing would come kneeling one of the cops was examining clifton and making notes on a pad i m his friend i said and a cooked pigeon mac he said you ai nt got any friend any more i looked at him hey mickey the boy above us called the guy s out cold i looked down that s right the kneeling cop said what s your name i told him i answered his questions about clifton as best i could until the wagon came for once it came quickly i watched numbly as they moved him inside placing the box of dolls in with him across the street the crowd still churned then the wagon was gone and i started back toward the subway say mister the boy s voice shrilled down your friend sure knows how to use his dukes biff bang one two and the cop s on his ass i bowed my head to this final tribute and now walking away in the sun i tried down the subway stairs seeing nothing my mind plunging the subway was cool and i leaned against a pillar hearing the roar of trains passing across on the other side feeling the rushing roar of air why should a man deliberately plunge outside of history and peddle an obscenity my mind went on abstractedly why should he choose to disarm himself give up his voice and leave the only organization offering him a chance to define himself the platform vibrated and i looked down bits of paper whirled up in the passage of air settling quickly as a train moved past why had he turned away why had he chosen to step off the platform and fall beneath the train why did he choose to plunge into nothingness into the void of faceless faces of soundless voices lying outside history i tried to step away and look at it from a distance of words read in books half remembered for history records the patterns of men s lives results who fought and who won and who lived to lie about it afterwards all things it is said are duly recorded all things of importance that is but not quite for actually it is only the known the seen the heard and only those events that the recorder regards as important that are put down those lies his keepers keep their power by but the cop would be clifton s historian his judge his witness and his executioner and i was the only brother in the watching crowd and i the only witness for the defense knew neither the extent of his guilt nor the nature of his crime where were the historians today and how would they put it down i stood there with the trains plunging in and out throwing blue sparks what did they ever think of us transitory ones ones such as i had been before i found brotherhood birds of passage who were too obscure for learned classification of natures too ambiguous for the most ambiguous words and too distant from the centers of historical decision to sign or even to applaud the signers of historical documents we who write no novels histories or other books what about us i thought seeing clifton again in my mind and going to sit upon a bench as a cool gust of air rolled up the tunnel a body of people came down the platform some of them negroes yes i thought what about those of us who shoot up from the south into the busy city like wild jacks in the box broken loose from our springs so sudden that our gait becomes like that of deep sea divers suffering from the bends what about those fellows waiting still and silent there on the platform so still and silent that they clash with the
friends let s have a festival of talk you start cress cress asked a question she had been wanting to ask for a long time tell us about that the picture a large one in a narrow gilt frame hung on the wall just above the keyboard of the piano so that cress when she practiced often looked at it the picture was of mrs charlesbois as a girl she wore a purple the picture was hand tinted velvet dress with a train and there waspwhite fur ermine cress believed around the neck and the edges of the great bell shaped sleeves on her head she wore her hair long even then was a golden tiara just large enough to encircle the mound of her up piled hair was that cress asked the dress for your coming out party coming out party oh cress mrs charlesbois laugh was like her hair and skin warm a mingling of rosiness and darkness her voice laughed at the funniness of that suggestion but it cried too at something sorrowful in it she left the fireplace and took the picture off the it as if it were a mirror coming out party sweet little cressy what would i have come out of or to she carried the picture over to mr rivers and cress was the audience now as mrs charlesbois one hand on the back of mr rivers chair addressed her talk to him were you ever in oilinda she asked a little oil town up in the stubble hills the houses throbbing all night with the pumps and the coyotes coming down at dawn to steal the kids pet rabbits mr rivers looked up from the picture saying no by a shake of his head you ve missed nothing mrs charlesbois declared i was born there i think maybe i m the only baby who ever was most pregnant women could nt stand the smell of the oil and the constant throb of the pumps and the buzzards and snakes anyway i was born there and went to school there and was the picture of me queen of the orange county fair they could nt possibly have elected anyone else they could have but they did nt fifteen or twenty other girls were candidates but i won easily oil men make big money or did then and they are easy spenders you voted she explained by buying tickets at a quarter each one man a driller bought an even hundred so i won i reigned for the five days of the fair rode around the county sitting on the back of a convertible and accompanied by a five piece band such crazy nonsense on the second night of the fair i was formally inaugurated floodlights a full band then and so forth they gave me this ring that night it was my prize for winning the election she held up her left hand and showed them the diamond she wore above her wedding ring it is small but deep and true in color then looking over mr rivers shoulder and speaking objectively she was really quite a pretty girl then there was a small silence before mr rivers as if the truth must be spoken however awkward or difficult said she was beautiful inez she still is it was the first time cress had ever heard mrs charlesbois called by her first name she looked at her as if beneath the familiar outline she might see emerging a new and more intimate personage and for a minute that hidden person did partially emerge that sweet regal newly crowned girl was there in the room more real than the grown up music teacher oh mr rivers she said thanks thanks i was seventeen then and that was seventeen years ago why i m old enough to be cress s mother easily old enough at first cress thought proudly that mrs charlesbois was do nt i have a daughter like cress but she was nt sure because the next words she said were me me inez dresden she took the picture from mr rivers and went to the window with it and gazed into the picture rather than at it since that was the darkest spot in the room i was the first queen they had ever had who could do anything except pose in a bathing suit or ride on a rolled back convertible top when they found i could play the piano they had me play every night in the intermission between band pieces cress said oh i wish i could have seen you and heard you i was just about as good then as i am now i m afraid afraid cress said one should grow develop geniuses cress said fiercely ca nt improve like other people can they they once again cress had the feeling that the young queen was there in the room but mrs charlesbois the music teacher came back and chided her do nt be silly cress nevertheless she ran her finger over the glass of the picture as if hunting for that lost fur and velvet and diadem i met luther the last night of the fair she said luther cress repeated mr charlesbois he came up onto the grandstand and played a duet with me he d had about one bottle of beer too much and someone had dared him to do it we played beethoven s appassionata together mr rivers who knew about serious music said the appassionata cress said i did nt know mr charlesbois played i did nt know he even liked music i do nt think he does any more mrs charlesbois replied taking the picture back to its place on the charlesboises at ten thirty mrs charlesbois asked is there really any sense in your going home at this hour cress why do nt i just call your mother and tell her you re spending the night here there s
except his envious although not grudging imagination backed by such slight apparent proof as that she came into my room in her petticoat this was only because we lived on the same floor she went into kayo obermark s the same way we had the attic between the three of us it just was proximity even if provocation was never far away it came simply from unremitting practice like that of the fiddler who has a rubber ball in the pocket of his and is never far from for him the greatest thing along the accidentals and slides of landscape and steel rail no she came to borrow a cigarette or to use the closet where she kept the overflow of her dresses or to talk we now had something more to talk about for by and by we found we had another connection it was through that swarthy sylvester for whom i used to pass out movie handbills and who had tried to make a communist of simon he had never finished his degree at armour tech he said it was from lack of dough and hinted also his political assignment elsewhere but it was everybody s thought that he had washed out be that as it might he was living in new york and working for the subway at a technical job under forty second street he seemed bound to have occupations in the darkness and by now this had laid a peculiar coloring on him his face darkened sallow and slack cheeked and his eyes injured the skin by the continual effort and wrinkling his eyes probably at the ruby and green cut buttons of his burrow office there where he sat at a drawing board and copied blueprints and read pamphlets in his leisure time he had been expelled like frazer from the communist party on charges of infantile leftism and trotskyist deviationism the terms were queer to me and just as queer was his assuming that i understood them he belonged to another party now the trotskyites and was still a bolshevik and disclosed that he was never free from duty never unassigned never went anywhere without permission from party chiefs even returning to chicago ostensibly to visit his father the old man called by grandma the baker he had a mission which was to contact frazer so i inferred that frazer was being recruited to the new party i happened to walk behind them on fifty seventh street one day sylvester was toting a fat briefcase and looking up at frazer accent while frazer was looking past and over him with aloof gravity and had his hands clasped at his back i also saw sylvester on the stairs of the rooming house with mimi he was or had been mimi s brother in law married in new york to her sister annie who had now left him and was getting a divorce i recalled how his first wife threw stones at him when he tried to come through her father s backyard to talk to her and i even remembered the surroundings in which i had heard about this from him the grim air of cold milwaukee avenue when we peddled razorblades and glasscutters with jimmy klein sylvester wanted mimi to plead with her sister for him hell mimi told me as much for my private ear as any of her opinions were if i had known him before they were married i would have told annie not to do it he leaks misery all over i wonder how she could stand two full years of you imagine being in bed with him and that mud face and those lips why he looks like the frog prince i hope now she ll get under the sheets with a young strong stevedore if somebody fell against mimi s lines she had no mercy and as she listened to sylvester she kept in mind her sister bolt upright in a huskier man s clasp and struggling her arms with pleasure and it made me for a minute dislike her for her cruelty that she held her eyes open for sylvester so that he might look in and see this what was to make it an acceptable joke was the supposition that he could nt see no he probably could nt it needs to be explained that in mimi s hard view all that you inherited from the mixing peoples of the past and the chance of parents encountering like texas cattle was your earthy material which it was your own job to make into admirable flesh in other words applied to sylvester he was in large was a bad kiln and also it was his fault that he could nt keep his wives and girls i hear his first one was a dizzy bitch and annie has something of a slut about her too what makes them go for him at the start that really interests me said mimi and she supposed that they must take his little gloom for real devilishness and expect him to visit their places with prickles and fire like a genuine demon when he failed to turning out to be mere uncompleted mud they threw stones at him real or figurative she was savage minded mimi and prized her savagery as proof that there was no monkey business about her she punished and took blows as the real thing that humiliated bandy legged weak haired and too long however the subterranean draftsman and comedy commissar of a soviet america to be teaching himself the manner and even the winner s smile and confidence why he was going to blast off the old fresh humanity he tried to impress me with the command he had over marxian coal and cotton plenary dates factional history texts of lenin and plekhanov what he had really was the

a bench and gazed at notre dame till almost dawn how quiet the city is a lonely shabby man is pushing a handcart through the city streets lines space harmony softened by dark mists dusk of dawn kissing the pavements with tenderness i doubt if gil would understand feelings like these yet they mean so much to me to my heart mine is the glory of those angels against the background of that pearly infinite sky june thi m so this my honeymoon is it possible that gil has betrayed me so cruelly so cynically for days now i ve pretended to be ill to avoid having it out with him but in the end i must do it it all began that afternoon when i went to see a loft bank art exhibit i stayed behind and got to talking to some of the younger artists both american and french all of whom were complete strangers to me one young man an american expatriate obviously a trotskyite began a violent tirade against the party charging that membership in the party was death to artists i told him that i was a painter and did not think so he then told me not to be naive like that eva blount who had had such a stunningly successful exhibit in new york last spring he did nt know who i was and i asked him what was so naive about eva blount he said that it was common knowledge in radical circles that gil blount had the party for prestige purposes he went on talking of other instances where such had happened i was silent i felt cold dead to stand in a crowd of people and hear them talk of you like that i asked him how he knew this and what right he had to spread such foul gossip about people he did not know he then went on to tell things which only someone close to the revolutionary movement could know he said that gil s secretary rose lampkin was his mistress and had been for years and that at the same time she was spying on gil i could not contradict him to hear one s private life spoken about so brutally in public god it ca nt be true yet his words explain so much is that why gil is away from home so much is that why he never comes to me except when he s drunk oh god i feel i ve no ground under this and that rose lampkin woman gil s secretary is she his mistress is that why he insisted that she accompany us to paris the more i think the sicker i get i try to tell myself that this can not be true yet in my heart i know it and feel it june has all but said that it s true which means that when i confronted him he would not say anything he raves at me telling me that i m trying to undermine his party position that i m slandering him i asked him to send rose back to new york and he said that it was the party s decision that rose remain with him and rose when she came to the hotel this morning had a cold smirk on her face she knows that i know according to gil i must accept this betrayal and be loyal to the party to be loyal to my feelings means betraying the party feel that everybody s laughing at me that everybody knowsi could kill gil i must be calm i ve only my work left that s all i tell myself all day long that i must give my life to my work if i make a sudden hysterical move i ll lose my grip on myself gil has predicted as much can there be betrayals as intimately cynical as this i m a fool to wonder for it is true it stares me in the face but i do nt want to believe it that s what makes it possible no one wants to believe it what coldness people are capable of i walk the streets all day to keep thoughts of suicide from filling my head june th my whole life seems tainted unclean i ve asked gill to take me back to new york he says he will as soon as his duties with the french party are over i begged him to give me the fare and he says was in the orphans home i did nt lose heart then and i must nt now i wo nt i ca nt give up i must work work work paint but can i paint again gil warned me that i must not talk of this he demanded to know who told me about the party deciding that he was to marry me he accuses me of having anti party friends i m afraid if i stay with gil i ll loathe myself if i run off the party will attack me publicly branding me a renegade all of my friends are party people and they would no longer speak to me night and day gil demands that i be loyal to the party but i owe myself some loyalty too how can i face myself in the years to come knowing that i have been bought and in such a shameful way gil says that my personal feelings do not count does nt he know he there s no doubt about it i stand before my easel and can not paint i m numb my love of work is gone when gil comes into the hotel room i begin to tremble with shame and rage and he tells me that i must not can not talk to anybody if i protest the party will destroy me last night he relented a tiny bit and said that i could be free only if i
and i felt the waning convulsions of her terror better that i tear out my own heart and hurl it to the passion of quemadero than that i should pain the heart of my beloved she looked up at me searching my face and the panic was gone from her eyes and they were pleading say you this she implored this i say then swear i swear like a frightened bird with a broken wing she darted into the big room and snatched the poniard and sheath from the wall and raised the hilt to my lips by this you swear this the cross by this i swear its admonition trust god and hammer on she thrust it into my hand and rested her head on my shoulder and close to my ear and whispered then wear it rodrigo of triana that the cross of your faith and the steel of your honor may remind you forever of your vow and now i was as guilty as she and must share her guilt for the secret of heresy was as heinous as its practice and the inquisition tolerated no distinction between information concealed and apostasy done her lips touched my ear in a caress of dew and she abandoned herself to my arms suddenly whimpering and crushing my mouth and biting my cheeks and neck in frenzied bliss the manliness of my breed scorned place and time and i imprisoned her in my embrace and looked from her to the couch and she felt my resolve and slipped from the bonds of my rapture you must depart she opened the door and the rain misted her hair in glorious adornment belly i must attend my father rodrigo farewell she encouraged me through the doorway gently pushing and closed the portal and i stumbled down the passageway to the street of felicity and the rain smarted my cheeks where her frantic nails had ripped my flesh before she kissed away the pain my first thought was of my father to protect him from any knowledge that his associate was a judaizing converso and i concocted a story that harana had not answered my knock and that i had taken refuge from the storm and had fallen on the cobblestones in my haste to return woe the lies of youth flow foolish the conspiracies of heart and tongue my father was waiting for me at his desk and one glance dissipated my intent for deception the haggard lines of his face and the indictment of his eyes besides the poniard was at my hip and how could i pretend i had not entered the harana home he motioned me to the bench and glanced quickly toward the us and mudarra some of the dread that i had first noticed on my father s countenance began to disappear and he said impassively now you know i did not reply i could not this i would have spared you my son and the sin is mine yours the poignancy of my question touched him and his visage changed to infinite tenderness aye mine he nodded the verdict i have known all along that the haranas are christians by day and jews by night but i needed luis and luis needed me and it might have worked had not the heart of my son and the heart of his daughter become entwined in the mystery of youth s first love i should not have gone there tonight i sought solace for him in my own condemnation the ledger was not here i opened your desk he got up and stood tall before me he an andalusian and the rodrigo at the bridgeless chasm you have crossed i should have been here to forbid your impetuosity this day is the feast of purim when jews commemorate their deliverance from haman and the fealty of esther and the guile of their vengeance on their enemies i stood too and my head was as high as his and my shoulders as broad i have sealed my lips the poniard was in my hand and i held it before him by this cross i have sworn reckless warrant of love s duress he flung up his arms in a gesture of exasperation now you have the stain of their guilt even as i he took the poniard and its sheath and put them in his desk and looked hard at me again and there was a glint of pride in his eyes but by the sky gods of your gothic forebears a man is born a man he clasped his hand on eyes of your tutor of your own confessor are mirrors for the inquisition i nodded toward the back room and asked and what of mudarra mudarra has no tongue for ouemadero s ears now to your monastery and we will choose our course on the morrow begone in haste rash youth before the tempest of my apprehension rises to the tempest of this night that bedevils us i ran all the way to the monastery panting and stumbling when i reached the door and it was closed vespers had passed and the cloisters were still and i pounded on the door and juan ruiz de medina clattered free the bolt and let me in straightway i went to my quarters pretending petulance and disgust and straightway he came to me and put his candle on my bench and studied me in the yellow light of the revealing flame then he spake you were delayed by the storm perhaps it was most violent yes scratches were tender and very dark the streets are slippery and the rose thorns sharp along the way let him think what he would that i had been brawling or whoring he reached for the candle and the yellow light was in his yellow eyes you will fast tomorrow and remain in your quarters all of next week even friday yes my fray he
was only half a dozen blocks down the line but dr varley was away to hell and gone in the altadena hills a long hot boring drive yes or no the final answer was yes for three good reasons one was that you can never know too much about the shadow line and the people who walk it file peters had got out for me was just that much thanks and goodwill the third reason was that i did nt have anything else to do i paid my check left my car where it was and walked the north side of the street to the stockwell building it was an antique with a cigar counter in the entrance and a manually operated elevator that lurched and hated to level off the corridor of the sixth floor was narrow and the doors had frosted glass panels it was older and much dirtier than my own building it was loaded with doctors dentists christian science practitioners not doing too good the kind of lawyers you hope the other fellow has the kind of doctors and dentists who just scrape along not too skillful not too clean not too much on the ball three dollars and please pay the nurse tired discouraged men who know just exactly where they stand what kind of patients they can get and how much money they for credit doctor is in doctor is out that s a pretty shaky molar you have there mrs kazinski now if you want this new acrylic filling every bit as good as a gold inlay i can do it for you for novocain will be two dollars extra if you wish it doctor is in doctor is out that will be three dollars please pay the nurse in a building like that there will always be a few guys making real money but they do nt look it they fit into the shabby back ground which is protective coloring for them shyster lawyers who are partners in a bail bond racket on the side only about two per cent of all forfeited bail bonds are ever collected abortionists posing as anything you like that explains their furnishings dope pushers posing as urologists dermatologists or any branch of medicine in which the treatment can be frequent and the regular use of local anesthetics is normal dr which there were a dozen people all uncomfortable they looked like anybody else they had no signs on them anyway you ca nt tell a doper well under control from a vegetarian book keeper i had to wait three quarters of an hour the patients went in through two doors an active ear nose and throat man can handle four sufferers at once if he has enough room finally i got in i got to sit in a brown leather chair beside a table covered with a white towel on which was a set of tools a sterilizing cabinet bubbled against the wall dr vukanich came in briskly with his white smock and his round mirror strapped to his forehead he sat down in front of me on a stool a sinus headache is it very severe he looked at a folder the nurse had given him i said it was awful blinding especially when i first got up in the morning he nodded sagely cap over a thing that looked like a fountain pen he pushed it into my mouth close the lips but not the teeth please while he said it he reached out and switched off the light there was no window a ventilating fan purred somewhere dr vukanich withdrew his glass tube and put the lights back up he looked at me carefully no congestion at all mr marlowe if you have a headache it is not from a sinus condition i d hazard a guess that you never had sinus trouble in your lift you had a septum operation some time in the past i see yes doctor got a kick playing football he nodded there is a slight shelf of bone which should have been cut away hardly enough to interfere with breathing how ever he leaned back on the stool and held his knee just what did with an uninteresting pallor he looked like a tubercular he asked he was a thin faced man i wanted to talk to you about a friend of mine he s in bad shape he s a writer plenty of dough but bad nerves needs help he lives on the sauce for days on end he needs that little extra something his own doctor wo nt co operate any more exactly what do you mean by co operate dr vukanich asked all the guy needs is an occasional shot to calm him down i thought maybe we could work something out the money would be solid sorry mr marlowe it is not my sort of problem he stood up rather a crude approach if i may say so your friend may consult me if he chooses but he d better have something wrong with him that requires treatment that will be ten dollars mr marlowe come off it doc you re on the list at it i gave him dr vukanich leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette he was one of my cards to look at instead he looked at it what list would that be he inquired the barred window boys i figure you might know my friend already his name s wade i figure you might have him stashed away somewhere in a little white room the guy is missing from home you are an ass dr vukanich told me i do nt go in for penny ante stuff like four day liquor cures they cure nothing in any case i have no little white rooms and i am not acquainted with the friend you mention even if he exists that will be ten dollars cash right now or
that he hide katherine away in one of the northern castles and of his indignant repudiation of the idea adding with tenderness it seems joan has forgot what love is sweet heart or she could nt suggest such a thing in fact joan s intervention had but increased his ardor and far from hiding katherine during these three and a half years he had taken her with him on all his journeys throughout england the constables of his yorkshire castles pickering knaresborough and the gloomy pontefract of the high peak in derbyshire of newcastle under lyme and tutbury in staffordshire as well as of kenilworth and leicester had grown accustomed to receiving lady swynford in the duchess s place nor during that time did these constables ever see the castilian duchess she remained at hertford in retirement rumor said that she was sickly a little crazed which could not be said of lady swynford there were four beaufort bastards now the last a year old girl christened joan for her father the duke appeared to dote on all these babes as wholeheartedly as though they had been fair born the three little beaufort boys john harry and thomas squatted now on stools by their parents knees gaping at the antics of their elders while the duke caressed the curly yellow head of his namesake and asked katherine some laughing question with all the fond domesticity of a contented husband no one else took much notice of the duke and katherine all eyes were turned on the lord of misrule the bridal couple and the king but geoffrey chaucer watched his sister in law with sharp interest geoffrey had eaten and drunk a bit too much he pushed back from the table unloosed his girdle and the lower buttons of his pearl gray surcote which was too tight a fit he had not worn it since the coronation and felt much easier in his usual semiclerical rood thought geoffrey settling back in slightly tipsy contentment little katherine had thoroughly tamed that fierce plantagenet leopard it must be nine years that she had enthralled him and to judge by the duke s attitude now his passion for her was strong as ever that was a long time for the sweet fire to burn so bright geoffrey thought with a touch of envy yet he had always deemed katherine an exceptional woman she had borne six children she must be about thirty but her beauty was undimmed though it had acquired assurance and lost the touching wistfulness the new quality was not brazenness certainly katherine could never be that yet there were changes her gown was low cut as that of edmund s promiscuous isabella and katherine leaned openly against the duke s shoulder as she had never used to do still her gray eyes were clear as crystal her high white brow smooth as a girl s and the new fashioned bohemian headdress gave to her a look of moon above their faces unfortunately suggested a horned cow it was so with his philippa geoffrey glanced sideways at his wife on whom the wassailing had taken effect philippa was breathing hard and staring glassy eyed at her heaped silver plate as though daring it to accuse her of being drunk thanks to katherine she was as well gowned as any of the noble ladies but her horned headdress had slipped over one ear and its blue gauze veil trailed in the sauce philippa would be very cross in the morning ah well t is christmas and a wedding too geoffrey thought it was a year of weddings and matchmaking the duke single hearted in all that he did having turned his mind to domestic matters had now married off two of his children in ways most advantageous to their prosperity if not their happiness however nobody expected happiness from marriage and least of all the duke though he had achieved it once even now though geoffrey was fat and forty of the duchess blanche the duke had procured for his henry another great english heiress such as blanche had been but the marriage of these two children promised no such felicity henry was thirteen and his bride twelve up there at the high table in her glittering finery one could see the child trembling like a little white leveret but she would return to her mother s care tomorrow the duke had no intention of prematurely taxing the breeding powers that would eventually produce the next lancastrian heir though some less wise fathers threw the children into bed together at any age and accepted whatever consequences might arise she s an ill tempered vixen asserted philippa suddenly enunciating with great care she s scowling at me who asked geoffrey looking around and trying not to laugh for his wife s dignity was much impaired by the further descent of her headdress philippa raised her spoon and pointed at the hawk nosed countess of buckingham her bride s soothingly t is simply that she dislikes this wedding scowls at everyone though it was true that eleanor de bohun s angry eyes rested on philippa s dishevelment with disgust her fish mouth was set in continual disapproval anyway thomas of woodstock s wife vehemently agreed with her husband and resented the duke s perfidy in snatching her little sister from the convent where they had sent her to be a nun mary s return to secular life and marriage to henry reinstated her as co heiress to the vast bohun fortune and correspondingly halved eleanor s share only an uneasy desire to keep an eye on the proceedings lest worse befall had brought eleanor to the wedding at all and she made no effort to be civil she glares at me retorted philippa belligerently because she dares not be rude to katherine oh i heard her in the garderobe squawking to her ladies that i d no right to be seated above the salt
grove and monterey sit side by side on a hill bordering the bay the two towns touch shoulders but they are not alike whereas monterey was founded a long time ago by foreigners indians and spaniards and such and the town grew up higgledy piggledy without plan or purpose pacific grove sprang full blown from the iron heart of a psycho ideo legal religion it came fully equipped with laws ideals and customs on the town s statute books a deed is void if liquor is ever brought on the property cas a result the sale of iron and wine tonic is fantastic pacific grove has a law that requires you to pull your shades down after sundown and forbids you to pull them down before scorching on bicycles is forbidden as is sea bathing and boating on sundays there is one crime which is not defined but which i is definitely against the law hijinks are or is forbidden it must be admitted that most of these laws are not enforced to the hilt the fence that once surrounded the pacific grove retreat is no longer in existence once during its history pacific grove was in trouble deep trouble you see when the town was founded many old people moved to the retreat people you d think did nt have anything to retreat from these old people became grumpy after a while and got to interfering in everything and causing with two roque courts roque is a complicated kind of croquet with narrow wickets and short handled mallets you play off the sidelines like billiards very complicated it is they say it develops character in a local sport there must be competition and a prize in pacific grove a cup was given every year for the winning team on the roque courts you would nt think a thing like that would work up much heat particularly since most of the contestants were over seventy but it did one of the teams was called the blues and the other the reens the old men wore little skullcaps and striped blazers in their team colors well it was nt more than two years before hell broke loose the blues would practice in the court right alongside the greens but they would nt speak to them and then it got into the families of the teams you were a blue family or a green family finally the feeling spread outside the family you were a partisan of got so that the greens tried to discourage intermarriage with the blues and vice versa pretty soon it reached into politics so that a green would nt think of voting for a blue it split the church right down the middle the blues and the greens would nt sit on the same side they made plans to build separate churches of course everything got really hot at tournament time things were very touchy those old men brought a passion to the game you would nt believe why two octogenarians would walk away into the woods and you d find them locked in mortal combat they even developed secret languages so that each would nt know what the other was talking about well things got so hot and feeling ran so high that the county had to take notice of it a blue got his house burned down and then a green was found clubbed to death with a roque mallet in the woods a roque mallet is short handled and heavy and can be a very deadly tied to their wrists by thongs like battle axes they did nt go any place without them there was nt any crime each did nt charge the other with including things they d outgrown and could nt have done if they d wanted to the blues would nt trade in green stores the whole town was a mess the original benefactor mr deems was a nice old fellow he used to smoke a little opium when it was legal and this kept him healthy and rested so that he did nt get high blood pressure or tuberculosis he was a benevolent man but he was also a philosopher when he saw what he had created by giving the roque courts to the pacific grove retreat he was saddened and later horrified he said he knew how god felt the tournament came july and feeling was so bad that people were carrying pistols blue kids and green kids had gang wars mr deems after a period of years he might as well act like god there was too much violence in town on the night of july mr deems sent out a bulldozer in the morning where the roque courts had been there was only a deep ragged hole in the ground if he d had time he would have continued god s solution he d have filled the hole with water they ran mr deems out of pacific grove they would have tarred and feathered him if they could have caught him but he was safe in monterey cooking his yen shi over a peanut oil lamp every july to this day the whole town of pacific grove gets together and burns mr deems in effigy they make a celebration of it dress up a life size figure and hang it from a pine tree later they burn it people march underneath with torches and the poor helpless figure of mr deems goes up in smoke every year here are people who will say that this whole account is lie even if it did nt necessarily happen to a casual observer cannery row might have seemed a series of self contained and selfish units each functioning alone with no reference to the others there was little visible connection between la ida s the bear flag the grocery still known as lee chong s heavenly flower grocery the palace flophouse and western biological laboratories the fact is that each
an few pilots were familiar with more than certain stretches of given rivers all at once aware of a quickening vibration beneath his boot soles matt peered helplessly into that wall of gloom beyond the wheelhouse s open windows godfreys it had grown mighty thick out there hal there it is perceptibly the contraband runner s easy prbgress slackened while she passed over a bar and felt the tug of the bottom the vibration also became briefly intensified then decreased as the westernarrow re entered deep water what sort of reception would they be accorded at new madrid the confederate s commander especially if he were new on this station might still be smarting over the loss of fort henry and so confiscate the western arrow and imprison her crew it went without saying that the southerners must also be anxious over the outcome of that big fight shaping up around strategically vital fort donelson in cairo generals grant smith and mcclernand had been reported to be closing in on that fortress like the jaws of philo s voice drawling must be close to five matt i m telling parker to reduce speed thrice he pulled a signal bell cord with the result that presently little tongues of flame no longer curled through the smokepipe s iron crowns and the western arrow s paddle wheel slowed reckon you d best warn bullwinkle to rig our signal lanterns philo drawled but just then the swift little freighter became illumined by a series of blindingly bright flashes off to starboard then a roundshot and some shells screamed by sickeningly close to the wheelhouse somethingstruck the contraband runner aft heeled her over and caused a sharp cracking noise keeristl must be some wildcat battery on nigger head island gasped philo with the help of his relief pilot he cramped the wheel down hard a larboard and so presented a diminished target to the maverick guns bullwinkle came pounding up from below cursing wildly goddam hayseed milishy s got no business there can we get clear before panted philo better show them signal lamps but even as the red blue red lanterns were run up the independent battery s guns fired for a second time luckily this time it scored no hits thanks to a previous visit to new madrid matt knew what ought tobe expected once they left behind the frowning but mercifully silent batteries of island number ten new madrid was a thriving river town situated on dangerously low ground it now was crowded beyond belief by the approach of fighting its sun bleached unpainted and uninspired buildings rose upon the missouri shore sprawled untidily away from behindits levee and a row of warehouses the court house modelled on the usual greek temple was the only important building in evidence still new madrid remained a pretty place backed by tall woods and dotted with towering live oaks trailing ghostly gray beards of spanish moss from gnarled branches profound indeed had been the relief of everyone aboard the western arrow when beyond a single challenging gun to which mr bullwinkle had responded had remained silent matt decided that if union gunboats ever steamed this far south they would be in for a very hot fight at this point the mississippi turned almost back upon its course forcing traffic to hug the eastern shore a surprising number of steamboats lay tied up along new madrid s waterfront the vessels most noticeable amid the huddle of transports freighters and tugs were two ironclad confederate gunboats general van dorn and general jeff thompson both were single funnelled sidewheelers and undoubtedly much faster than any ironclads matt had ever beheld protected by casemates made of railroad rails bolted together these small men of war appeared grimly efficient silently their crews tramped out on deck to watch this low dull black painted sternwheeler come nosing cautiously into the levee undoubtedly the white flag fluttering at the jackstaff where the stars and stripes previously had been shown must have aroused curiosity for numbers of confederate soldiers mostly clad in butternut tinted uniforms or parts thereof came shambling along the streets of new madrid to loaf about the levee and there were also a good many rag clad negroes in evidence but practically no civilians probably it was too early in the day sleet had given way to rain which lashed at the western arrow s superstructure and the wide guards running along her sides no sooner had the steamboat s landing stage been lowered than matt cassius bullwinkle and philo daingerfield tramped ashore and sought a small group of civilians wearing ponchos and stovepipe hats significantly only a single military figure was on hand a stout red bearded fellow wearing a wrinkled gray tunic which bore the braid of a major curling up its sleeves his trousers muddied to the knees however were of checkered wool and tucked into clumsy cowhide boots he wore a black slouch hat with brim turned down to ward off the rain kepis evidently were not popular or more probably unobtainable in this theatre of the war matt splashing through mire and horse droppings towards the group waiting under a rickety shed reflected on what he had just made and new batteries added at fort bankhead situated on a bluff immediately upriver and in fort thompson a little way downstream many more troops were in evidence that the confederate high command intended to hold this strategically important town of new madrid in force was evinced by the fact that on a near by levee cannon of heavy calibre were being craned out of a pair of barges which must have been towed up from memphis and vicksburg matt recognized several individuals standing in dripping raincapes and ponchos among them he was relieved to note lieutenant colonel hazeltine s corpulent figure cadaverous tom jennings and dignified appearing mr luke pender who resembled a deacon but who could offer the subtlest of bribes he was reputed
his command boat out to within hailing distance of sherwood s vp you handle the rest of the boat traffic steve he shouted i m going to use my boat on salvage work randall is swamped are you punning friend sherwood waved a lanky arm in acknowledgment i ll police the surf line mac go ahead and rescue the perishing macdougall grinned and turned to hatcher stand in close to the beach we ll take the left flank and share salvage with mr randall have your men break out the towline as hatcher complied macdougall added we do nt want to spend the night here digging wrecked boats out of the sand macdougall had left the removable canopy of the command boat ashore this morning preferring the better visibility of an open boat when midday sun had scorched down he had momentarily regretted this decision now he was glad he and hatcher could see all around and the deckhands could get about to handle their lines in a hurry he stood on the decked overbow just forward of hatcher and the wheel here he was clear of the towline and could watch beach boats and sea from time to time he threw heaving lines to landing craft in need of help the towline was fastened to the heaving line deckhands in troubled vps hauled it aboard and dropped the eye over their sternposts after each craft had been safely retracted towline and heaving line were recovered and gotten ready for the next boat most of the cargo was ashore now in the face of a freshening wind soldiers and sailors alike were working in an excited vet pleasurable frenzy laughing splashing and heaving with all their strength the end of a week s grind was in sight there would be liberty tomorrow the landing spot for various types of materiel stretched along the central portion of the cove at watched with concern while two lcvps loaded with artillery shells headed through the surf together they could not be handled at once carried away by the excitement of throwing goods ashore they must have disregarded sherwood s instructions to land one at a time he had better get over there hatcher he called sharply pointing to the two boats let s get them out of there see those big rollers coming in along the shallows hatcher opened throttle the command boat rose on a swell and ran across the little cove just outside the breakers then headed in towards the two vps the rolling swell was much heavier here at the edge of the cove the two boats were already in trouble in spite of anything their coxswains could do they drifted closer to the shallow rim where surf crashed frighteningly against sloping sand when within hailing distance macdougall climbed upon the bow of the command boat his back to the sea he steadied himself guns which were just forward of the cockpit and hailed the two coxswains ahoy in the vps back out of there you re in too far to straighten out now you ll get pooped with a sea and broach hard on that reef back clear of the surf and get out of there back out both coxswains heard his shouts but did not seem to understand they looked around at macdougall faces bewildered doing nothing unless they acted their boats were doomed now the command boat rose high on a rolling swell lurched about weathered the crest and dropped into the trough behind it the machine gun barrel to which macdougall clung swung around he staggered for a moment then reached for a new grip on the gun and raised his megaphone those vps would never make it unless they turned fast between swells and got out of there hatcher shouted a warning to macdougall look the sea macdougall turned around and looked of his boat and almost upon them this was what luke stephens had been talking about there was no chance of escape frorn it macdougall shouted back to hatcher open her up and head into it with mouth wide open hatcher gaped at the enormous wave yet gunned his motor at once and spun his wheel swinging the command boat nearly head on to it take it on the shoulder yelled macdougall gripping his gun barrel and looking up at the sea that s it hold her there get some way on her quick no time to scramble back to the comparative safety of the cockpit macdougall wrapped both arms around the machine gun and hung on the boat had beam and power if she could only plane over the top hey were into the first wave now it did not seem possible for them to rise over it but the bow continued to lift higher and yet higher it planing while hatcher macdougall and the boat s crew held their breath the body of the wave swept under them lifting the boat by the middle bow and stern hanging in space propeller racing in agony until hatcher was able to move his hand to the throttle squatting with feet braced apart macdougall rode the bow clinging desperately to the gun thrust high he caught a momentary glimpse of craft shore and waves in the distance but his attention was drawn to the deep valley of water before him then with a sickening sensation as if the bottom had dropped out from under the boat it plummeted into the deep trough and brought up with a shuddering crash which nearly knocked the breath out of him macdougall looked up at the second wave it was bigger and higher than the first towering above them in a sheer green wall with sunlight gleaming through from the other side and foaming crest leering down upon them he knew that the boat the first wave the bow rose too slowly these new made hawaiian seas were steep and close together the boat was out of timing
in his palestinian yarmulke embroidered in gold thread and his magnificently braided taleth and delivered his little speech of gratitude to parents and rabbi in a confidentphebrew that brought murmurs of delight and appreciation from the congregation what was more important he had discovered that at thirteen he knew more than his father they told him he was entering manhood even his father had to concede it because it was so written although but even though he had suspected that his father s piousness like his philosophizing about business which morrow realized later was cribbed from the columns of arthur brisbane and roger babson was false and hypocritical it came as a shock to know that he himself could prove at least that his father s ponderous showing off of his religious knowledge was that of an essentially ignorant man it was then that he must have decided to become a rabbi as soon as he knew that the rabbinate would put him once and for all beyond his father s reach the period of religious intoxication had gone on for six months with enough fussiness about ritual and dogma to set even his mother s teeth on edge with his little sister staring at him in bewilderment as he wound his phylacteries and turned his face to the wall at its peak he had pleaded to be transferred from james monroe high to a torah true yeshiva in preparation for his future rabbinical studies and then it had stopped stopped so completely that joke the eternal reference to the days when morrow actually fasted like a saint and swore that he was going to be a rabbi why he had never really thought about it any more than you think of the color or pattern of a suit that you have outgrown but it seemed obvious to him now that it was not just a quirk of adolescence like a romance with a girl who encountered years later seems utterly ordinary and unexciting but an emotional response to his father s demand for unquestioning recognition and as soon as his father indicated that he was willing for him to go ahead with his dream of becoming a man of god the whole basis for his response was destroyed and hep turned back first to baseball then to girls had his father really foreseen what would happen was he shrewd enough to realize that the quickest way to free morrow from the infatuation with an idea which to the rest of the family meant only the sabbath candles was by pretending a much more likely did his own clinging to the forms if not the core of the ancient faith put him in such an awkward position that he could not declare his opposition to this impractical ambition without at the same time exposing his own hypocrisy so that he had to acquiesce in an abhorrent decision which meant the death of his material ambitions for his son whatever the case he had put the quietus on the whole thing as effectively as if he had gone to a child psychologist for professional advice and as a result he had forced morrow into a more subterranean form of opposition morrow adopted a surface agreeableness that was part of the war and yet could only disarm his father coupled with an underground struggle that was quiet relentless and unremitting as he finished high school and went meekly off to business college like a repentant boy led away to reform school for he hated his father he never hid it from himself although he behaved correctly and rarely gave cause who was not a fool became aware of the hatred and was furious in his helplessness to counter it even though he did his best to thrust his moneyed fist at the draft board and the army in an effort to reassert his parental omnipotence once morrow proud of his sister s looks and eager to establish some common ground between them or perhaps so it seemed to him now simply casting about in his loneliness for support in the long drawn out guerrilla battle had attempted to take her into his confidence to reveal to her the roots of his feelings and the reasonable basis for she prided herself even as an adolescent on her passionate devotion to what she thought of as reality as opposed to the idealism of religion or any abstract ideas for his hatred of their father only once but never again after that they had been flung even farther apart not just by physical distance but by the polar extremes of their feelings about their father and inevitably they lapsed brother sister relationship that only widened the gulf between them so inappropriate and foreign was it to their natures for no sooner had he attempted to tell her what herman felton was really like as a prelude to an explanation of his determination to undermine their father than she had flown into a wildly irrational rage and he discovered that betsy adored their father she worshiped him and whatever reservations she had as to his completeness and perfection she wanted to consider in solitude if not to suppress entirely all the little girlish daughterly tricks jumping on daddy s lap bringing him his evening paper like a puppy ruffling his hair and then carefully combing it these were nt simply stunts she had picked up at the movies but real expressions of a devotion and awe that she had no other legitimate means of expressing still he tried spurred on doggedly by the fear that betsy would be drowned in a sea of adoration and admiration for just those character traits to which she should have been most hostile they day and before plunging into the subway for the ride up to the bronx he had treated her to a soda at loft s do nt you see he said watching her greedily suck up the
her own pleasure he would be hers she never thought that she would be his it simply never occurred to her to think of herself as his whatever he would do with her caress her lie on top of her insert himself in her was part of her wakeful dream of undefined sensuality of which he was the essential and enormously desirable instrument she was convinced that he never had seen a live nude woman close to and she would lock her door and parade herself about her bed wearing no clothing and pretend that he was lying on the bed and looking at her for the first time she had reason to be proud of her figure it was a time of the long tailored line skirt blouse and ankle length coat following the natural waistline the design was to make women look tall with vertical stitching and piping to further the scheme edith was an ideal model for the suits and dresses and even the hats which were enormous and elaborate and expensive were if not becoming effective in drawing the attention away from the face that was less than beautiful no man ever had seen her unclothed and that too was going to be part of the great sensuality when she owned joe she was quite aware that men of her class expected the girls of her class to be virgins and inmost cases the expectation was justified not knowing exactly what to expect limited only by her unlimited imagination she conducted orgies of the mind with herself after an evening with joe while at all other times maintaining a calm that was her public character it was also the character she presented to joe chapin calm attentive interested sympathetic eager to learn after a while he became totally dependent upon her without realizing it gradually other girls had become he told her so frivolous and empty headed that he was regretting invitations that would involve his having to be paired off with them his own friends too his contemporaries were beginning to appear in a bad light they were not taking things seriously enough not buckling down to work not thinking things through it was not exactly their fault he said they had no one to help them think things through with this conversation edith moved into the first stage of owning him she began to let him do things for her she would ask him to stop at a shop to pick up something she had ordered she had him do little errands for her on his visits to philadelphia she asked for and took his advice on investing a small sum of cash she had him read a letter of sympathy she had composed on the death of a far off cousin she sought his truth she never intended to take then so fortuitously that she would not have dared plan it she was stricken with acute appendicitis and had to undergo emergency surgery at that time the appendectomy was years away from the routine operation it was later to become and a stay in the hospital was likewise a matter for great concern the newspapers of the day always spoke of a patient as going under the knife chloroform was the usual an aesthetic and the word hospital was considered to be suitable evidence of the extremity of the patient s condition the horses drawing the ambulance proceeded at a walk or a slow trot and the ambulance hell pressed by a large pedal button was more of an announcement than a warning signal the doctor and the nurse rode inside with the patient and because of the comparatively slow pace of the team of bays the citizens were able to have a good look at the faces of the professionals the faces told little more than the seriousness of their mission itself was likely to dispel fear or create optimism it was a social convention that visits to hospital patients were restricted to members of the immediate families this was no less true for patients in private rooms and it was especially true where the patient was an unmarried young woman when joe chapin read in the paper that edith had been taken to the hospital lie first paid a call on dr english at the doctor s office the doctor revealed that it had been a nasty operation and that edith had been on the table almost three hours in the tradition of his calling the doctor employed words of greek and latin origin that joe chapin was at a loss to understand but in reply to the direct question dr english cautiously admitted that edith would live barring unforeseen complications when do you think i can go to see her bill said joe chapin had you intended to go see her well i would like to if possible well said dr english and you understand of course you d have to have permission from her family oh of course i do nt as a rule encourage visiting joe edith has a day nurse and a night nurse she s still on the critical list and i should think it d be a week before she d be ready to see anybody except her family i ll abide by your decision but i m really very anxious to see her yes yes that hardly comes as a surprise and very understandable but for the time being i m keeping a close watch on her to guard against any post operative complications you understand of course and as a man of the world you understand that a young lady does nt always look her best in a hospital gown so there s that to consider bill i have to tell you this i but i m in love with edith i m glad to hear that joe not altogether surprised but i m glad to hear it i ll tell you what
who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic what struck me with sickening force was how should i put it the voluble familiarity of her way as if they had known each other oh for weeks and weeks i saw him scratch his cheek and nod and turn and walk back to his convertible a broad and thickish man of my age somewhat resembling gustave trapp a cousin of my father s in switzerland same smoothly tanned face fuller than mine with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth lolita was studying a road map when i got back into the car what did that man ask you lo man oh that man oh yes oh i do nt know he wondered if i had a map drove on and i said now listen lo i do not know whether you are lying or not and i do not know whether you are insane or not and i do not care for the moment but that person has been following us all day and his car was at the motel yesterday and i think he is a cop you know perfectly well what will happen and where you will go if the police find out about things now i want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him she laughed if he s really a cop she said shrilly but not illogically the worst thing we could do would be to show him we are scared ignore him dad did he ask where we were going oh he knows that mocking me anyway i said giving up i have seen his face now a relative of mine called trapp perhaps he is trapp if i were you oh look all the nines are changing into the next thousand when i was a little kid she continued unexpectedly i used to think they d stop and go back to nines if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse it was the first time i think she spoke spontaneously of her pre humbertian childhood perhaps the theatre had taught her that trick and silently we travelled on unpursued but next day like pain in a fatal disease that cones back as the drug and hope wear off there it was again behind us that glossy red beast the traffic on the highway was light that day nobody passed anybody and nobody attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadow as if there were some spell cast on that interspace a zone of evil mirth and magic a that was almost artistic the driver behind me with his stuffed shoulders and trappish mustache looked like a display dummy and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with our shabby vehicle we were many times weaker than his splendid lacquered machine so that i did not even attempt to outspeed him lente currite noctis equi softly run nightmares we climbed long grades and rolled downhill again and heeded speed limits and spared slow children and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields and no matter how and where we drove the enchanted interspace slid on intact mathematical mirage like the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet and all the time i was aware of a private blaze on my right her joyful eye her flaming cheek a traffic policeman deep in the nightmare of crisscross streets at half past four p m in a factory town was the hand of chance that then with the same hand cut off my shadow a score of cars were launched in between us and i sped on and deftly turned into a narrow lane a sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread crumb was tackled by another and lost the crumb when after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering i returned to the highway our shadow had disappeared lola snorted and said if he is what you think he is how silly to give him the slip i have other notions by now i said you should ah check them by ah keeping in touch with him fahther deah said lo writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm gee you are mean she added in her ordinary voice we spent a grim night in a very foul cabin under a sonorous amplitude of rain and with a kind of prehistorically loud thunder incessantly rolling above us lightning said lo whose dread of electric storms gave me some pathetic solace we had breakfast in the township of soda pop iooi judging by the terminal figure i remarked fatface is already here your humor said lo is sidesplitting deah fahther we were in sage brush country by that time and there was a day or two of lovely release i had been a fool all was well that discomfort was merely a trapped flatus and presently the mesas gave way to real mountains and on time we drove into wace oh disaster some confusion had occurred she had misread a date in the tour book and the magic cave ceremonies were over she took it bravely i must admit and when we discovered there was in kurortish wace a summer theatre in full swing we naturally drifted toward it one fair mid june evening i really could not tell you the no doubt with self conscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady the only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces more or less immobile prettily painted bare limbed seven bemused pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally judging by the partisan flurry here and there among the audience and were supposed to
the brandy holly asked smiling just a couple and then i either go on the wireless as an announcer or return to being a white hunter peter said in the african make up there is really no such thing as love kindness or gratitude as we know it because they have lived all their lives and their ancestors lives in an atmosphere of terror and violence there is no proper love between man and woman because the woman is bought for goats and is used as a beast of burden there is no gratitude because it would never occur to them to give anything to anybody else and from others they lie habitually because to lie is the correct procedure else some enemy might find a way to do them damage if they tell the truth they have no sensitivity about inflicting pain or receiving pain because their whole religion is based on blood and torture of animals and each other they think even the best of them that nothing s funnier than a wounded animal or a crippled animal it s a big joke i do nt even think that they themselves feel pain the way we do i ve seen em with their legs broken and the bones sticking out and i ve seen masai youngsters half eaten by lions you sew em up with a sail needle and they grin like it was fine fun i must say they re good to their kids as a rule but maybe that s because the female children represent a big annuity for the family and the males are tomorrow s warriors and day after tomorrow s tribal elders and the black coffee boy came with his wheeled tray holly poured the coffee one sugar please tom said you d say this applies to all the tribes or just to these what do you call them kyuku kikuyu mostly the kikuyu for two reasons mainly they have a reputation amongst the other tribes as crafty witch hounded lying sea lawyers they were never proper warriors or hunters but always shifty agriculturists and sneaky murderers forever out to do the next bloke in the eye their system of land tenure is one of the most complicated in the world and so is the tribal setup for instance all the agitators like kenyatta and the other boys that ran the old kikuyu central association which was banned for subversion at the start of the war and its present successor the kenya african union are always screaming about us taking the kikuyu land actually where they scream the loudest they never we gave em a new reservation you ll see it and took up land for ourselves the land we actually got from the kyukes we paid for but then the agitators say that no one kikuyu can sell any land at all to anybody it s a business for the clan and then it gets to be the business of all the clans the kyukes do nt say much about the fact that they took most of what they call their own ground from a bunch of wild hunters named wandrobo first paying for it by agreement and then gradually forcing the wandrobo out like the camel that stuck his head in the tent to understand the clan system you have to understand that every child is his own grandfather which makes him the father of his father and his uncle is his brother and so forth and it works the same way more or less on the female side everybody is everybody else including his dead ancestor member the main thing is that they fell smack in the path of our movements out here so we ve had em for neighbors and god knows we have nt helped them any now by damn i will stop somebody else talk i never ran on before like this in my life i m winded i assume then nancy said that you actually like the individual negro but only in certain categories and always as an inferior peter looked up almost but not quite angry they damned well are my inferiors in the white man s world as we know it out here i do nt mean to be rude but you ve been in nairobi only half a day i admire a great many of their skills and i love the true savage on his own savage ground and i love a great many things about all the tribes but i live here i was raised here and i know sit in the legislative assembly it s a method of thinking for a start they tried the equality thing once in a trial letting the elders decide the guilt of a proven murderer they d found the murderer literally pulling the spear out of the dead man the elders acquitted him they asked why for the acquittal and one elder said it is well known that kikuyu never murder the next one said the accused owed me six goats the third one said the accused was my cousin now that is all this is supposed to be a wet bright night in nairobi my apologies for nancy tom deane said but she took a couple courses of sociology in her senior year in college somebody told her sociology courses had no labs well i m curious nancy said i do nt see any point in coming all the way out here without asking some questions buy i m sorry i was b minded eland straps sure when a wog loves his manamouki very much he gets her some eland straps as a token of affection what is a manamouki exactly and this business of eland straps whatever they are well a manamouki is the best word for female in swahili it means she thing whether it applies to animal or human that is what a she thing is called manamouki there is nt
of aeschylus she spelled it escylus sophocles euripides homer vergil tibullus catullus pliny and aristophanes only by hearsay but she had a passion for trisyllables of latin or greek derivation was she perhaps taking desperate measures to remedy her lack of a classical education as southern poor whites sometimes supplement an insufficient diet by eating clay from some riverbank but if she did not know titles of the chief works of every well known contemporary american and british poet novelist and critic and called some of them by their first names the advanced women s college from which she had been graduated with the degree of bachelor of arts had apparently kept a procession of famous men and women passing through its student lounges he sometimes fancied that he himself was only cooling his heels in an anteroom dedicated to some postgraduate course in which miss golightly was enrolled so persistently did she quiz him about his literary acquaintance what she was after of course was what women like her were always after the artist en pantoufles only nowadays they were nt satisfied to have him served up en pantoufles they wanted him in the buff bough she would probably spell it sometimes at night when he could not sleep he found himself writing expository prose using miss golightly s spelling and locutions she had confided to him on the first day that she came to was too lazy to study any of the established methods and too vain to acknowledge that she lacked the professional equipment for her job he had told bill pettigrew that she was too ignorant to discharge the duties of a secretary satisfactorily bill had expressed surprise she had been a classmate of his sister s at gertrude newman s he said and had graduated summa cum laude he had advised claiborne to keep her you might get a girl from leonard he had said so i might god save me claiborne had returned it must already be past the hour during the last few min utes the throng of people pouring out onto the street had swelled perceptibly this building occupied almost half of a city block and thrust the blunt tower in which his office was located god knew how many feet into the sky high enough to dwarf the figures he was looking down on almost every figure hesitated a second as it reached the threshold of the building as so fast now that it filled the whole sidewalk and boomerang on the dark tide to amber islands in the wave the bow of the boat from which horne had dived would have been about the same height as this tower in which he himself now stood and horne when he jumped might have thought of himself as a missile which would return to the hand that launched it there had been an interval they said during which he threshed about in the water calling for help but there had been no return and no amber island unless you call the belly of a shark an island the captain had seen two of them closing in on him he had tried to talk horne out of boomerang in that poem having no formal education horne never scrupled to use a noun for a verb any time it suited him having that much at least in common with miss golightly the stream was sent down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore keep that gertrude newman stuff up long enough and they ll make lesbians out of the lot of them but it was nuns who were rending the gory visage now the doings doubtless of that strange large woman that george crenfew s flighty young wife had turned into odd to think of her associating with nuns or not so odd perhaps in the old days she had always been off on some mystic quest once she and horne and joe paster had kept a jarful of rainwater sitting around the studio for days while they added this or that to it according to some formula of black magic they had got out of an old book he looked at his watch it was only ten minutes past four if he left the office now he still had time to go down to mott street and talk to that nun before cynthia would expect him long enough to knock some is it the driver said claiborne saw a three story house that many years ago had been painted white between the house and the curb a gray unwieldy serpent crawled unshaved men in ragged grimy clothes were forming a line around the corner and marching up to the old mansion it had a stoop a little elevated above the street the soup kitchen was evidently located in the basement beneath the stoop the serpentine line flowed steadily until it came abreast of the stoop when it wavered and coiled back upon itself before it slid out of sight down the steps ever since claiborne s cab had pulled up at the curb a few minutes ago the men had been shuffling up to the house three and four abreast they came in silence for the most part and most of them looked straight ahead as they walked though now and then some younger man whose eyes kept roving over the faces of his companions as if he were surprised to find himself among them emitting a short laugh say something in a low voice to which the older man did not always respond there was one man who had attracted claiborne s attention when he first came in sight at the corner a tall man who carried himself with a kind of jauntiness or was it only that he moved with exaggerated lightness as if he had a fearful care for his very bones he was neatly dressed in a dark worn suit the battered gray hat that rode high on the
years before his guinea pig pand if they passed a horse fallen to the cobblestones and saw the driver sweating to get the animal to its feet alexandre would boast papa could get that horse up easily more likely it s on account of your father that the poor beast fell his mother would suggest and little alexandre would agree proudly yes papa could push any horse over papa is strong none of this childish worship incidentally went to the mother and why should it mother was quite different mother was forever washing her little boy combing him scolding him mother would say stop scuffing your shoes do you day or else blow your nose what will people think when they see a boy of your age with a runny nose and she would pin a big square piece of sheeting to his blouse there now you ll remember i hope what a torture that rough piece of cloth was screaming to everyone i m a little boy who still has nt sense enough to blow his nose when it runs yes that was mama mama forever after him to sit up straight you want to know why you keep having those ugly coughs well let me tell you it s because you re always sitting all hunched up and to teach him to hold himself properly she would sew to the inside of the collar of all his blouses a little button and whenever she looked up from her work and would see him sitting round shouldered she d say button button and that was the out his chest and bring his neck back to where he could feel the button ah that s different now you re feeling the button one can see it now keep feeling it how different life was when papa came his arms were full of bundles wrapped in newspaper bundles which he would drop on the table in order to grab up his boy run out with him onto the landing and toss him high up in the air up we go up like a balloon his mother would gasp and scream because there on the land ing the stairwell yawned ho ho silly mama is nt she a silly to think that we re going to let our boy fall down those steps you can toss him in the room not high enough the ceiling is too low in the room must you toss him at all is nt he getting too old for that s cheeks when she was aroused as long as these arms can still toss dumas would say i m going to toss him that s what god made fathers for with big muscles to toss their children he gave fathers big muscles and mothers big breasts god knew what he was doing as for little alexandre he was never frightened by the yawning steps he was never afraid of anything when his father was around only when he was with his mother then at night he would often wake up out of his sleep and scream with fear after the tossing came the examination of all the packages that papa had brought oh the delight of opening papa s packages always some new surprise it was as if every time papa came to visit them it was once again new year s day jour d etrennes day of gifts there would be fruit and melons and a cut of meat or fish or put these away in crocks in the pantry there would come the best part of all the sweets in little packages wrapped in striped or colored paper sugared plums or else dragees of almonds or nougat or on rare occasions delight of delights rings of glaceed pineapple about which father could tell stories of the distant tropics where pineapplesgrow islands that rise up suddenly out of a warm blue sea like huge green gems what stories papa could tell of men in prison and of sailors in shipwrecks and of the time he had gone boar hunting and the boar could be heard grunting deep in a thicket grunting like this ugroink ugr groink papa could imitate every kind of animal and then of how fire was brought down from heaven and of the girl who was changed into a tree throughout the whole of his first six or seven years papa s stories were just like a golden haze surrounding little alexandre and from year to more streams of enchanting light as if a fairy sun were rising out of banks of fog is this a time for sweets mama would exclaim angrily laying her hands on the striped paper packages why he did nt even finish his soup at lunch you gave me too much soup alexandre would cry no one could eat so much soup i ll be judge of how much soup a little boy should eat his mother would declare with mama one could never say i do nt like this or that you had to finish what was on your plate let him have at least one taste catherine dumas would beg little alexandre was already breaking into a wail but his father secretly nudged him and gave him a big wink while mama went on oh well if you re going to take charge of him from now on i ve like but be prepared to hold yourself available if he gets sick that s all i m saying and while they were arguing papa would slip little alexandre a piece of candy which he had hidden in his hand catherine darling please do nt flare up these visits to see the two of you are my moments of purest joy then you ve nothing to do but make your joy permanent all you have to do is tell your mother about us and we can all please sweetheart believe me we will yet be a little
melora actually i have found very sweet children they are a softly modulated voice said in impeccable english the three heads of representative janson representative smithfield and ensign siegel snapped around like jerked puppets they stared in horrified disbelief at the source of the remark which was the girl ensign siegel looking at the girl saw some of his quoted guidebook words flash across his mind like the huge illuminated words on the times building news ticke hancroid yaws gonorrhea an enormous flood of embarrassment engulfed him a great speechlessness that seemed as if it could never be broken seized the three americans madame ensign siegel finally managed to mumble and saw a smile in the girl s eyes at the word i am ensign siegel of the united states navy instantly lie realized how ridiculous this sounded i gathered you were in the united states navy the girl s eyes were amused above her how do you do she said politely how do you do ensign siegel heard himself echo then he said in weak stuttering tones this is representative janson of the united states congress and representative smithfield of the united states congress how do you do the girl said with flawless manners how do ma am representative smithfield said jerkily removing his panama hat pleased to meet you representative janson stuttered removing his navy hat in his confusion he dropped the hat he stooped and scooped it up fumblingly it s a real pleasure to meet you the honors in etiquette were all on the side of the girl who was the only one at ease the congressmen hurried into the behavior they would have put on on finding out suddenly that she was the daughter of their most influential constituent we re honored to have two members of congress visit tanalolo the girl said represent new jersey said representative janson meekly north carolina said representative smithfield contritely the girl smiled pleasantly both sides of the mason dixon line she said this is an honor thank you indeed representative janson said respectfully the honor is all ours representative smithfield said gallantly the girl turned easily to ensign siegel who wished he could find some place to go into the ground so you speak tuluran she said with polite interest an unusual accomplishment for a navy officer i get around the villages siegel heard himself explaining this sounded stupid in his ears so he added i like languages that he felt instantly was no improvement he had a completely frustrating sensation of being unable to be anything but stupid in the presence of this girl but before he could think of anything further to say she turned back to leave this pleasant conversation she said but you know how it is when you have four children you two look as if you re parents yourselves she said in tones of sweet inquiry i have three representative janson said shamefacedly i have five representative smithfield admitted avoiding her eyes the girl turned back to siegel i m sorry i did nt have my children all four of them along for you to meet she said her eyes mischievous they are such sweet children i m sure they must be a constant source of amusement to you ensign siegel said impassively i have enjoyed them very much she said after a quick good bye in tuluran to the old man she was gone the two congressmen and ensign siegel watched in silence as she walked lithely down the road whew representative smithfield sighed where the hell did she come from smith college ensign siegel turned to the congressmen light thunderstorms occur throughout the year he said loudly from a guidebook memory passage especially during the summer the season of the most serious storms typhoons and typhoon type tropical disturbances is from august to december november being called by the natives humalong remain in the village time at least one damaging storm hits tulura each year ensign siegel picked up the palm toddy jug from the porch and took a solid slug of it straight from the jug gentlemen remain in the village time is over let s get cracking over to that seabee battalion as he shoveled the gentlemen from north carolina and new jersey back into the jeep ensign siegel was

planning of the average assault operation of the pacific campaign of world war ii consider hundreds ammunition chocolate bars drums of gasoline cans of peaches c rations tubes of toothpaste pairs of socks and underwear traveling thousands of different routes from origin to final destination and item quantity and route all of necessity determined months ahea ach must needs come ashore at its specific time on its specific spot on a tiny atoll set in the great ocean wastes the coordination sense of detail and foresight required to bring this off called for a wizardry little short of sublime this job belonged to vice admiral d d boatwright he was the brains of the pacific war it was his genius which largely planned the great island assaults synchronized a million men and the education of admiral boatwright billions of dollars worth of materiel to the right spot at the right minute the navy had furnished admiral boatwright its finest education and it found in him a veritable naval

snatch in paris one of the first i ever was mixed with but never mind it now thank you mr moto said i quite agree with ruth bogart asked am i going with you or not certainly not jack rhyce said quickly there wo nt be any need ruth if he does nt see me he may not show she said i ve known it to happen jack as things stood then it seemed safe to discount that possibility jack was actually experiencing a feeling which was almost one of peace as far as he could see the japan assignment was drawing to a close if the ending was not wholly satisfactory it was effective and with the way things were going they could not beat about the bush forever his main mission had been big ben he took the blackjack from his hip pocket tossed it in the air and caught it with the same carelessness he would have caught a baseball on the outside it was very nicely constructed the japanese were always good at detail no said you ll only be in the way if there s any kind of hassle he s a big boy and he may muss things up i think mr rhyce is correct mr moto said i am most grateful to you miss bogart and it would be so nice if i could pay you my respects when this is over perhaps a japanese supper tonight but ha ha not at the cimaroon and just with me and mr rhyce but ha ha not with mr ben at then mr rhyce and thank you very much the feeling that everything was over still persisted after mr moto had gone it resembled the easing of tensions he had experienced before when a job was almost finished and everything was in the groove but this time elation was added to his relief which he tried to check because he always distrusted elation finally his conscience troubled him with a nagging suspicion that he was ending things might to an ultimate conclusion it was true that he was hedging his bets but it was better to hedge than lose and they were winning enough at least they were crippling the apparatus by taking out big ben you know i feel pretty good on the whole he said to her when we get him we can move the hell out of here and head for home her expression had brightened too it ca nt be soon enough for me she said and why ca nt we start being ourselves when we get on that plane i do nt see why we ca nt from there on in he answered what do you mean she asked from there on in a lot of things he said and we ought to be able to start discussing them as soon as i get back here do you mean you still love me but i do he said and a lot of other things come to think of it i would nt have missed any of this even being unprofessional she asked yes he said even being unprofessional jack she said what s going to happen to him he s not our problem he said the japs will take him over but it s the best we could do under the circumstances ruth he turned and strode across the room and back we might have gone further into this if bill gibson had nt died but i think it s time now to stop this show i really do it s sticky letting the japs take him she said i wish you and i were nt in it we re in it all right he said you re too nice for am too i would nt be surprised he told her but let s put our minds on pulling out of here tomorrow ruth the interval before his departure for the cimaroon always remained in his memory as a domestic sort of scene i do nt suppose we d better inquire about plane reservations yet he said no reason for anyone to know that we re checking out but if you want something to do while i m out you might start packing your suitcases there might be space on something tomorrow jack she said do nt you think you ought to wear something heavier and darker than that seersucker coat oh i do nt think so he answered this wo nt be night work and it s awfully hot outside i wish you were carrying a gun she said just in case would nt you like to borrow my fountain m going to need it i can do fine with this jack he said he was feeling almost jovial now that everything was set i m really pretty good at controlling one of these i think you ought not to wear crepe soled shoes she said you might slip in them i do nt know whether you ever knew bobby burke who used to work in paris he slipped making apswing at oscar ertz you know the czech just outside the gare du nord he skidded on the pavement and had a shiv in him before he could recover these shoes are skid proof he told her no i never did know bob but i ve heard plenty about him ought i to be jealous darling she said i never knew about you dear and you never knew about me you wo nt ever need to be jealous now let handsome so do you he said it was time to be going but he did not want to leave her jack she said if you do hit him follow through let him have it all he s an awfully big man you know now you d better kiss me good by i do nt want you to be late do nt forget moto s coming to take us out
mess the risk must be taken it s my duty as your squire to bring you such information as i can who knows this great goliath may have certain weaknesses if he has it will be talked about where the squires sit down to meat yes master rick it must be chanced the first flush of dawn was in the sky when richard wakened he had the room to himself save for a rustling the absence of his squire meant trouble something slithered by on the slimy floor and he hastily drew his feet up under him and crouched against the wall having no liking for this kind of visitor further reflection brought some reassurance if tostig s activities had been detected he himself would have been involved in the consequences by this time his mind resumed the train of reflection which had filled it during his last waking moments he repeated every scornful word spoken by the princess eleanor he carried a perfect picture of her in his mind the proud tilt of her golden head the coldness of the eye she had fixed upon him in which nonetheless there was a hint of tenderness although not for him alas the delicate modeling of her nose which no goldsmith could ever hope to equal the ivory perfection of her hands the instinct of the poet which was latent in all men of saxon blood wakened in him my great and lovely lady of all human beings but the more desirable for that you are like the red gold of dawn and the burning sunshine of midday but also you are the quiet blue of dusk and the silver path that the moon makes in the silence of the woods you can be like the storm which comes out of an angry sky but to those you deign to favor you are the rainbow which marks its end your loveliness is beyond description or comparison or even comprehension he paused at that and grinned guiltily in the darkness truly my head is full of flummery i know i shall never see this beautiful lady again this angry demoiselle who has such contempt for me there was a cautious step in the stone hall and tostig entered the room he carried a lighted torch which he fixed in an iron ring on the wall then he turned and regarded richard with a somber eye time to be up he said it was like the old days when he long legs and ran a hand through his tousled hair have you been out all night he asked i drank with the last of them in the guardroom then i came back and had a few hours sleep it was just as well i came for a black water snake was curled up at your feet an hour ago i went out again have you anything to tell me a grim intentness settled over the squire s face i saw your opponent last night he sat beside the cardinal and he made the churchman look like a sly little red squirrel the fellow is a full half foot taller than you and he has a face like an angry grinning owl they tell me his horse is an enormous black what were they saying in the guardroom you should have heard how they laughed last night thinking what their man would do to you such cackling and blowing off and a hulking codshead and i rolled him in a muck heap they are all certain he ll win huh the slutching fools are sure you ll he spitted like a gamecock and carried off the field in pieces he came to a halt beside the pile of rushes and stared at his master for although a free man he still thought no other term proper there s one chance master richard if you try for his shield you ll think you have come dead on against an iron mountain on hoofs you must aim for the visor i sat for hours listening to the jabber of these country fools and i found out one thing no one has ever tried for the visor because he sits so high above them he ll be taken by surprise you must contrive to hit him high and hard one chance only in ten that i could do it declared richard getting to his feet and like aiming at the moon i tell you it s the only way said the squire earnestly he s as slowwitted as a bull if you seem to be aiming for his shield and do nt swing your lance upward until the last moment he ll be taken so much by surprise that you may scoop him right out of his saddle i must win i must declared richard passionately she must keep that much memory of me at least yes you must win and a little practice before anyone rubs the sleep out of his eyes will be useful there s a quintain behind the seats i ll raise it to allow for the extra height in the saddle the spot to strike is where the visor is attached to the helm if you get him there he ll take the impact of it on his forehead it will unsettle his wits if it does nothing else and he ll go into the tostig was talking in this vein to strengthen the young knight s confidence both of them knew that the giant would come down the course like a black wind trussed in steel like the high waves of an angry sea only by the greatest skill could such sheer brute strength be met and sustained fetch messire out said richard and i ll practice at the quintain i m sure you are right this is my only chance tostig returned messire to his stall and then joined richard in the room under the moat the latter was still
himself set a term to their labor he began to question the men on the line with him one after another to find out how many of them felt as he did about what they were doing for a living more sure of himself with every passing hour he moved up and down the line demanding whenever there was a moment an answer to his insistent question do you think anybody likes coming in here to work everybody does one day a week payday said the solder flower not even the bosses said the deck fitter do you think anybody with sense would knock himself out in this dirt and noise if it was nt for the money and the this kind of work is it s colored man s work but even the colored men are smartening up they turn up their noses at it too unless they get strapped saddened and bewildered by this last comment walter turned away from the man who had made it and who had punctuated his bitter remark with a series of thunderous blows on a door that he was fitting only orrin the second metal finisher grudgingly admitted that the work was a challenge to him that the pay was fair and that there were worse jobs behind them all long jawed joe caught up with his work as usual stood casually beveling his screwdriver i hear you ve been taking a little poll he said to walter what s it to you walter asked truculently he was in no mood to be mocked with apparent irrelevance joe replied by demanding how come you fixed on being an engineer walter was taken aback is that s not reason enough for a fellow to struggle and sweat to get to college damn it does nt anybody go out and do what he wants to any more i m not saying you would nt make a good engineer or that it would nt be fine for a change to have some engineers who care as much about people as they do about gadgets but supposing you find out after you get to college that you want to spend your time learning something useless are you going to leave yourself open for it boy you sure are free with advice joe looked at him gravely his long sad jaw had the hint of a smile the men on the line like you walter they do nt think you re just nosy when you ask questions they think you re one of them and in a good way you are maybe that s why i ve got hopes for you walter fought hard against subversive outlook was so foreign to everything walter had been taught but he was forced to admit to himself that more and more he was seeing the factory through joe s cold discerning eyes and he began to fear that if joe were ever to leave the plant would have no real existence other than as a money producing nightmare not only was there no one else really to talk to about it but joe had forced walter to try to formulate his emerging ideas in an adult and comprehensible way the worst thing about the assembly line is what it does to your self respect he said to joe early one morning as they squatted on their haunches waiting for the starting siren it s hard to keep from feeling like a fool when you know that everybody looks down on what you re doing even the men who are doing it themselves joe hung his hammer and metal spoon from the brass hook at his belt the big pitch has always been that we repa impractical european dreamers that production can serve people but instead people are serving production look how frightened how hysterical the bosses get when the line stops they ca nt afford to figure what it costs you to keep it moving they only know they ve got a production quota of course when sales resistance starts building up and they put the cork back in themselves they give you just the opposite story who can blame the poor slob in the middle for suspecting that the whole setup is really as nutty as a fruitcake and for feeling ashamed of himself for being caught up in it all right walter challenged him who s crazy you me the guys around us or the board of directors anybody who gets suckered into believing that there s anything real behind the billboards they put up to get the show on the road so that he commits himself to buying the billboard pictures by selling his life on the installment plan that the whole world is against him that he s the victim of a huge conspiracy organized to make his car fall apart before it s been paid off does nt life in the factory seem to be deliberately designed to lower your own self esteem what happens when you re knocking down a dent if you rap it too hard from the inside you have to file it down that much more and you hate yourself for it if you do nt rap it hard enough you only find out after it s moved on down the line and then you have to hurry up and wallop it again in either case you hate yourself instead of hating the car or the invisible man that started up the line he laughed briefly in anticipation of what he was about to add it s like the man that hits his thumb with a hammer while he s hanging a picture only here he keeps hitting his thumb because they re moving the wall as fast as the union will let ball peen comes down on his nail himself i wonder walter said slowly how many people actually feel that way more than you can count it s always
was only a matter of time oh relax it s not anything like that it s just emotional rally round glory be to god breathed isaac his color returning well it s nothing to celebrate said comfort resentfully i mean this thing has really got me bugged bugged said isaac is i think not an unusual condition for you not this bugged she insisted daddy o listen something weird has happened all of a sudden i like boys i do nt just like em i mean i go ape when i think said isaac and when did this trans formation take place i do nt know three or four weeks ago i guess i first noticed it the night grady metcalf came around with his motorcycle you see his fossils promised him a motorcycle on his eighteenth birth day if he passed math and by fossils interrupted isaac i presume you mean parents what else said comfort well anyhow excuse me said isaac interrupting again am i to understand that grady metcalf passed math weirdsville ai nt it said comfort it is indeed he agreed yeh said comfort well anyhow grady met calf who is one of the really big meatballs of our generation and i hate him like poison he took me out riding on his motorcycle and you know what all of a sudden he did know what else when i saw him in school the next day he looked even better weirdsville said isaac solemnly but that s not the worst of it cried comfort all the boys looked good to me i mean i went down the hall and saw twerps and gropers that i would just as soon step on em as look at em and suddenly they did nt seem so bad after all in fact lately there s not more than fifteen or twenty boys in the whole school that i ca nt stand tell me said isaac nervously this new outlook of yours has it made you shall we say more tractable oh do nt worry daddy o i have nt done anything they still call me the iron maiden at school but i ll tell you the truth daddy o when i cope these days my heart is nt really in to cope asked isaac hopefully i do sighed comfort but it seems less important all the time and that s what bugs me daddy o why do i feel this way isaac was suddenly touched to the depths of his craggy heart he rose from his desk walked over to comfort and laid an awkward hand on her shoulder comfort child he said softly if the good lord in his wisdom had not seen fit to take your mother perhaps she could answer you all i can say is no matter how bewildering it all seems it is quite natural and soon everything will be in order again grand said comfort unhappily what do i do in the meantime in the meantime answered isaac you ve got rally round three hundred years of puritan blood in your veins listen to it the putnam s landing chapter of the dean presleyschool fatso s diner here starting at seven in the evening they would stand beside their hybrid automobiles tilt their pelvises hug their elbows smoke cigarettes tell lies about their sex life and spit after a while they would go inside the diner drink cokes lean on the juke box and play fats domino the clef tones and of course elvis toward midnight they would go home where during their absence their fathers and mothers had been arguing violently each mother contending that there was nothing wrong with the boy he was just passing through a phase and each father insisting that a good belt on the side of the head would send him through the phase a hell of a lot faster as the boy slouched into the house the mother would approach him with a sweet propitiatory smile and say would you like a glass of milk before you go to bed dear by way of reply he would snarl and lurch up to his bedroom while the mother bodily prevented the father from going after him and fracturing his skull thus passed a typical evening of a typical new delinquent spitting loitering and addling his parents no gas stations got held up no stores got burgled no citizens got mugged no blood got spilled and no girls got ruined the sex life of the new the flag boys delinquent was wholly conversational on week nights they had no dates at all on fridays and saturdays they drove the local girls to dark places and made out making out was nothing more than what used to be called necking or petting this activity as older readers will recall covered a good deal of territory but always stopped short of fulfillment the new delinquents were in their hearts as scared of real sex as they were of real larceny now on this night while comfort good pasture was having a heart to heart talk with her father four new delinquents were parking lot of fatso s diner each wore a ducktail haircut and long greasy sideburns each held a king size cigarette in his mouth each was seventeen years old they stood this quartet of rebels without causes these victims of the zeitgeist and made the following conversation what s the scoop for tonight said the one called wally same as last night nothin said the one called ed lousy burg is a lousy morgue said the one called charlie kee rap said the one called fred all spat they ought to have a youth center in this burg said wally where a guy could pick up some tail i could use some said ed it s been more n a week kee rap said fred rally round no honest said ed remember when my old lady took me to
a time we will never forget it was what the russians called a nagan a cheaply made capgun affair but schild accepted it reverently and though he detested firearms gave an earnest imitation of lichenko s ecstasy over the colt you agree you will exchange shouted lichenko my dear friend i salute you on his feet he highballed with the right hand a dwarf against the bas relief of the large americans who had started to surge genially upon him through the dismembered furniture schild was rising in honor of the moment at the very least to return the salute when lichenko began to discharge the he salute to fortune but the kick from the one convulsed his hand into another and he was drawn nolens volens into a full tribute below the scored ceiling and within the vermiculated walls lichenko now spent gun drooping sniffed the atmosphere of powder appeared about to sneeze did not and pushed a reproachful lower lip like a coal chute at schild ah my friend this american pistol he tore at his choker collar excuse me vasya is ill pand fell prone into the plaster which of course was now the common ground you win the medal said lieutenant leek an unjolly snowman to schild he blew clean his glasses and inquired silently with blurred vision for number one horse s ass berlin district nader touched schild s elbow and whispered look jack lovett went for the mps get your ass hole buddy out of here we ll con them he fingered back an eyelid peered at the red orb drunk as a skunk he ordered corporal reinhart to lend a hand reinhart lifted lichenko by the belt and pulled him over a shoulder veronica why do nt you go along asked nader jesus maybe he s dead o k thanks for the party said she i had a lovely time anyhow reinhart navigated through the rear door and into the garden already military police sirens sounded in the distance through the back yards having trouble at every sonbitching fence and around the block to schild s house was their silent way reinhart scalves were tired on the stairs but he gripped the banister and made it in good shape to the room where as his burden was lowered to the bed it came to life briefly displaying a revolving eye and returned to dreamland with a mouthful of bedspread veronica examined the body from a distance found it hale sir to do this for that russian if his army found out about it he d be headed for siberia and very seconded that i think said schild the american army is what we have to worry about at the moment he took a tiny package from his pocket can you use these anybody who ever opened a k ration had fleetwood cigarettes to dispose of yet reinhart was sure these were his own come home he was too weary the evening had been too extravagant to inquire by what route new relations consisting so fiercely in the precise time of day and the specific mise en scene the sudden dislocation of these threw both very and reinhart into a diffidence especially now as their task ended they went out of step down the sidewalk to very s house from the side of his eye reinhart could see her shoulder bag swinging off the divisions of silence an occasional officer or nurse not breaking from the party down the street its siren dying like a throttled pussycat another mp jeep arrived at her door reinhart chickened out of trying for a good night kiss perhaps with a view towards establishing his independence which in the pale simulacrum of post coitum tristis that was his after party letdown he felt had been compromised or perhaps it was a defense against the progressive frigidity she gave off as they approached the front step oh this is where you live he asked numbly haha were you going to charge me with breaking and en tering this cruel parody of his own earlier fantasies on the mansion of her person despite the false laughter whose spuriousness was advertised by its miraculous lack of resonance it was as if a great bell rang so shallowly that nothing trembled suddenly elicited his overdue response to lichenko s rampage to assault an entity of order to register a spontaneous nay against the sanctioned and authorized mean but it very skipped insouciantly inside the doorway shortly her other end appeared saying see you in the funny papers captain st george s surprise was limited he had rapped at and opened schild s door on his regular schedule of unnecessary morning information the bath is free and looked upon a scrawny alien fundament lichenko rump to door was bent in a study of his big toe schild s guest had awakened with a refusal to recognize his benefactor something schild however took in good grace and did not sully with a word as the russian scratched an elusive cap a pie itch lip farted at his own image in the mirror and spat a long drizzle of saliva out the window in droll reproof of the sunlight that made him wince then he turned said with ill humor da and undressed for an examination of his pelt st george recovered with expedition i thought you had a woman in here he chortled to had been his bed arising with the aid of the dresser corner khaki undershirt and shorts clinging to him like old crepe paper sallow hairy shivering berlin sair in the shadows stayed cold till noon schild said as st george averted his eyes so what else is new he watched the dull pain fill the captain s eyelids distend his cheeks sag the loose mouth and lower the chin going down like mercury in a chill it was a kind of crying just beneath the epidermis years of it had

war you would not have known they had been snowflakes if you had not seen in their young faces certain deeply etched lines which ordinarily are found only in old faces they added fresh life to the town of baranof some of them stayed and became alaskans and bred alaskans army bases ringed the town gay hued private cars and drab army cars and trucks swarmed the pavements and pretty young mothers and vigorous young men and perambulators and strollers and toddlers imparted to gold street a virility that hit you with the impact of a blow perhaps bridie s maternalism stemmed from those days when she a young frightened homesick girl had come to baranof alone and lonely she knew and understood about some of those men scarcely more than boys surrounded by thousands at close quarters at morgensternor kinkaid air bases who on leave they washed shaved dressed with extra care boots were shined uniform brushed they lounged around baranof s gold street they dropped in at the juke box joints they slipped coins in the slot to be lulled or soothed by the tranquilizer artificial music a mechanical sound hammered out you re a livin doll or the whining self pitying ballads of the day why did you leave me was it to grieve me you in my arms you have those charms they sat in the uso big room listlessly reading an outside newspaper a week old the colored boys huddled in a corner watching tv you rarely saw them standing on a street corner these boys surveying a passing alaska world in the dim cold calling out an unconvincing and unconvinced hello gorgeous to a bearlike female figure so muffled in hood parka mukluks mittens that it was impossible to tell whether she mingle with the ground or very rarely you did not see air wives shopping in baranof they lived an intensely concentrated social life on the vast base as did their martial male mates the women belonged to clubs on the bases they attended teas cocktail parties dances movies their children went to base schools pas bridle put it somewhat sniffily for her air does nt mingle with us peasants but those kids those boys around they kill me the look on them the girls began to arrive from everywhere again they were following the men into alaska but they were not at all like those girls who had come at the turn of the century they looked terribly young in the inadequate pale blue coat and the little high heeled pumps hatless the pretty dress belling out over the bouffant nylon petticoat as they stepped off the plane into the icy airport no one in baranof quite knew how bridle ballantyne had become unofficial welcomer chaperone these girls who suddenly prim and apprehensive descended out of the air into the waiting arms of an equally stiff apprehensive young man in air force uniform or in parka and mukluks everyone in baranof knew bridie so perhaps in the beginning one of the air force men or one of the construction workers or one of the baranof college students had said to her meeting her on the street or in the uso uh mrs ballantyne i m going to be married day after tomorrow i thought you d like to know you been mighty nice to me getting me acquainted round and so on i m having some trouble getting her a place to stay overnight she s coming in on the noon plane from seattle tomorrow the girl on the plane had kept her hair in pins until the last possible moment and had then rushed to the lavatory to unpin the curls that sprang in lovely tendrils to frame the flushed or pale face the eyes wide with sudden doubt tell which was heartbeat and which the throbbing of the great plane s engines she put her hand to her breast where his air force ring hung suspended by a slender gold chain there had been young men on the plane and these had eyed her with interest and speculation and longing but now they relinquished their fantasies her face was pressed against the window as the plane taxied in her eyes searched the figures at the airport gate there he was and beside him and speaking to him was a white haired woman who looked a little like her mother only more smartly dressed the eager young men in the plane said one to another give it up boy she s fetched there had arrived dozens scores hundreds of these in baranof in the past few years addie barnett had been one of them and paul barnett had been the man at the gate peering nearsightedly at the figures spilling from the plane s maw and now bridie met the day no one quite knew why she did it bridie knew and perhaps thor storm he once said to her it s because of the way you came to alaska that day is nt it bridie i guess so she admitted and closed her eyes for a moment as she remembered the girl in the picture hat and the long sweeping skirt who had clambered up the beach in response to

thing was just a great big god damn waste of time that s all you re sore about that they wasted your time danny s the corner of his lower lip he stared at george for several moments then his face cleared the way it always did when he had something figured out and danny grinned georgie boy he said what else do you want me to be sore about again in his mind george ran through some of those things uncle zisha had said years ago about judge brandeis and the land of opportunity only a little while ago in the corridor of the allied employment agency there had been enough power in those rememberedphrases to make george haul off and belt a total stranger now in the light of danny s grin the phrases suddenly seemed embarrassing i do nt want you to be sore about anything george said uncomfortably it s just that i do nt know getting roosted out on my tail like that just because i m a jew it burned me up what s that got danny said george did nt answer every place you go there s bastards they do nt like hecbs most of them they can drop dead who needs them but the other ones the guys they got the jobs to hand out you go around letting these stupid jerks burn you up just because they do nt like the shape of your beak where the hell you going to get the dough to pay for your oh henrys george did nt know how to answer that any more than the people of fourth street who had tried to get danny s father to stop danny from running errands for mike gerrity had known how to answer mr schorr when the house painter asked them if they planned to make him another rockefeller the grin slid away from danny s face you got to keep your eye on the ball he said belting guys because they do nt like jews that s okay if you want to be a hero but mind what you want danny paused and the bright restless brown eyes seemed to grow a little brighter what do you want kid he said quietly you want a job or you want to be a hero what george wanted all of a sudden was a hole to crawl into he dropped his glance ile was ashamed of what he had just done in the allied employment agency ile felt grateful to danny for straightening him out he wondered why anybody as smart as danny schorr bothered to be friends with somebody as dumb as george hurst sure i want a job he muttered but when you want a job it s the guy who s got the job to give that calls the buts danny grinned and poked george gently with his fist come on dempsey he said let s get going where to george said danny said the fact that the place proved to be the home office of l l parker stores inc did not strike george as amazing until months later when he came to know something about the origin of the policies by which the large organization was run on the day when he and danny schorr were turned away by the allied employment agency george had never even heard of l l parker stores inc this was not surprising the l l parker stores which were spread across the face of america like acne functioned most successfully in towns with a population under there were those who attributed this success to a belief that the incidence of gullibility varies in direct proportion to the size of a community or as an embittered rival once put it big town small boobs small town big boobs ludwig leo pauker the once penniless german immigrant who founded the company explained it somewhat differently at the eightieth birthday dinner given in his honor him into the highly prosperous business soon after i came to this country i learned an important lesson the old man said according to a stenographic record of his speech that was circulated surreptitiously for years by disgruntled employees you buy something for one dollar you sell it for two dollars maybe you make a profit and maybe you do nt depends on how much of that second dollar you have to pay out for overhead but you buy something for one dollar and you sell it for twenty dollars and even a lousy businessman can make a profit regardless of overhead there are only two problems where do you find damn fools willing to pay twenty dollars for something that cost you only one dollar and how do you get them to pay it the answer to the first question proved to be stick to communitiestoo small to support many stores thus narrowing the purchaser srange of choice the answer to the second question was even simpler make the purchaser something that cost you only one a girl sees a hat in a window and she wants it continued the stenographic transcript of the multimillionaire octagenarian s birthday lremarks the hat has a price tag on it that says twenty dollars but the girl has in her pocket only three dollars you say to the girl forget the twenty dollar price tag give me the three dollars and you take the hat her eyes get big as pickle barrels and she says you mean it to prove you mean it you take the hat out of the window and you give it to her and she gives you her three dollars while she s trying the hat on you say the other seventeen dollars you can forget just remember only one thing for the next seventeen weeks every payclay you come in and give me another dollar that s all just one dollar every payday that s not a lot is it a
in our yard shouting trick or treat trick or treat and my gentle father who had never spanked me looking at me with a pained expression saying son this was supposed to be your job he did the job himself before my eyes whatever it was yes i assumed on slightest provocation a disapproving attitude toward myself and readily took the blame for things that were not my fault how shrewdly marrow sensed this and moved in and moving in opened the way to crippling himself because his appetite for destructiveness was insatiable for two big submarine building yards at kiel germania werft and deutsche werke but we had been crossed off the list because the found some trouble in a turbo and had grounded the body black was up on a wing opening up the cowling of the ailing engine marrow approached and he called up sergeant black a screwdriver was put down on the wing with more energy than was necessary and a dark haired pale faced head appeared over the leading edge of the wing listen to me sergeant marrow said and out came a tirade for marrow could not stand frustration least of all frustration of his urge to fly our crew chief was a strange bird he was subject to lightning changes of temper immediately after having been talking with us on the hardstand early any morning before a take off in an obviously jolly mood beaming like a seraph and going off trolling snatches from i m dreaming of a white christmas or waltzing matilda in a loud voice off key he could suddenly be heard to have switched with no apparent cause to a blowtorch and banging tools down on the skin of our poor ship and he s a bastard too a second f ing lieutenant of a bastard black was a small man in his early thirties with a big pocked plow of a nose not at all a standardized he went around in coveralls but swung the upper part off his shoulders and let the loose folds and sleeves hang down from his belted waist and his dead white arms were always streaked with black grease marks i do nt know why he was nicknamed red unless as a tribute to his temper he was outwardly servile toward all officers from the rank of first lieutenant upwards but he seemed to consider second loocys like me some species of schoolboy to be hazed and gulled at every turn under his fawning manners there lurked a tyrant let a corporal from the motor pool make a false move on our dispersal point and red would land on him like a hod full of mortar you where you out from under that wing but the other members of the ground crew swore by the chief whose meticulousness as a mechanic and whose worship of the body were unbounded he was a dedicated workman and this was precisely the point on which marrow attacked him pour lives depended on black s carefulness yet marrow accused him in vile insulting terms of being too cautious black appeared to be in an agony of agreeableness as marrow undermined his talent his triple checking cautiousness marrow said red should have let the turbo go another day so the body would not have missed a mission if we d lost an engine so what ships came home every day on three marrow made it out that black s care was a kind of timidity and that such timidity would lose us the war in the end marrow made black s finest quality as a mechanic seem traitorous we played in a pickup ball game with some ground grippers while the mission was being flown that day throwing arm funny that made me sore i guessed i was as bright as haverstraw taking aptitudes for number concepts and for verbal concepts together it was just that i was nt a lousy idiot savant your mathematical nut haverstraw would always be flashier than your all round socially adjusted intelligent high achiever boman and when buzz found out that haverstraw could remember his dames phone numbers for him and peg a ball like peewee reese he went all the way off his conker phooey on that later that afternoon i felt low i wanted to quit the whole show i sat in our room alone and i could hear test firing at the clay bank and as i looked through the window at the meadow on the near side of the flight line an english farmer crossed in the middle distance plodding behind six guernsey cows oblivious apparently to the firing he looked neither to right nor left but simply kept on walking with a heavy my chest ached for daphne p at the interrogation after a mission we flew the next day may fifteenth we caught as our interrogating officer an apple cheeked captain from wing headquarters who wore an unconvincing mustache more a plea than a declaration this mother s boy got off on the wrong foot with us right away by asking which mission this had been for us it was our sixth oh he said on a groaning note which had the effect of dismissing us as beginners and therefore unreliable we had thought ourselves rather seasoned the interrogation was held in the briefing hut into which a number of small tables had been moved an interrogator sat at each table with a stack of report forms before him and he took on one crew at a time when our turn came we of the body gathered around the pink faced young captain s table some sitting and some standing we were still in flying gear with our jackets unzipped heads and several of us held white mugs of coffee well our child captain began giving us a hard time it seemed that neither he nor any of the other interrogators even our own from the
hear she thundered at both of them and trembling she poured in great haste three glasses full of red wine to all of us she cried with great vigor raising her glass to girard girard malcolm exclaimed loudly to which he got no response from i was on the third floor attending the jazz rehearsal eloisa said i could not control my nerves i felt perhaps because malcolm is here something terrible was going to happen i could hardly wait to get back here to see if everything was all right be happy you can lead such a full life kermit told eloisa accept danger as part of the risk please eloisa said and she looked happy for the first time that afternoon i will not please kermit told her you have experienced nearly everything except perhaps being under fire in battle marriages musicians art love all the dazzle and excitement that can only come to a figure of the arts you re rubbing it in now eloisa became ill tempered again no i am speaking from the heart kermit assured her you deserve your coterie such as it is perhaps no other woman ever set foot i knew it eloisa cried helplessly you re ribbing me you invented modern jazz do nt deny it the little man went over to eloisa s chair stop him eloisa implored malcolm with a look of futility and your marriage to jerome kermit went on is it not the marriage of the century kermit stop right there with my marriage if you go further and she made a frantic gesture i ca nt hear no not even a compliment concerning my marriage my marriage is too close somehow to too close to what a deep feminine voice cried from the entrance to the room all eyes looked up to see madame girard coming into the center of the room a sun parasol in her hand closing her eyes and raising her parasol gently into the air she given the sign madame girard cleared her throat but she did not need to wait for silence she had created the deepest kind possible addressing again now her auditors she said i have only come here to claim what is my own a reasonable re quest i am of course a reasonable woman let there be no interruptions please madame girard turned to malcolm who had stood up only as a matter of fact to hear her better but she had construed his movement as an attempt to interpolate sit down madame girard commanded malcolm sotto voce she continued closing her eyes again why should the rest of the world know plenty happiness domestic satisfaction love while i am shut out from all these things deprived of a woman s human station in life turned in upon my own devices and saddled here she opened her eyes directly and immediately upon the tray with the with a husband who knows not whether i am alive or dead and cares yes cares dear eloisa i can feel you are shaking your head so stop cares less madame girard eloisa managed to get out silence i say madame girard addressed herself briefly to eloisa i know you are a woman of talent perhaps genius but your words your advice whatever you have to offer here this afternoon is worth no more to me than yesterday s bath water kermit shrank into his chair his bravado of a moment ago completely vanished while gazing glassily at the woman he had feared so long to meet but since she kept her eyes closed allowed him for the time being to stare at her with impunity malcolm began to look sleepy and eloisa brace overcome by the day s fare of brandy wine fear and confusion began whimpering softly i have been called unreasonable by still tightly closed and fluttering like a medium who sees the ghost she had never thought to catch i who am the most reasonable of women the kindest the most generous the one who wants to give all her love yes all here madame girard opened her eyes wide and when they fell on eloisa the latter cried out stop her oh stop her somebody madame girard closed her eyes again but then changing her mind she opened them suddenly and said will you be quiet lady while i am delivering my speech why do you think i am here but to get you to see reason hear reason follow reason reason eloisa cried for good god s sake why does this house not fall upon us when such words are spoken kermit brought eloisa her wine glass which in the confusion of madame girard s entrance she had put madame girard continued and raising her parasol a bit too carelessly the point of it caught one of the stuffed owls which rested on the mantle and brought it flying to the carpet where it suddenly disintegrated into a heap of dust and feathers do nt touch it madame girard warned at the signs of motion on eloisa s part you shall be repaid triple for this damage but to get back she went on wronged not only by that satyr girard girard who has divided his lifetime into passion for money and lust with servant girls no no madame girard you wrong him malcolm exclaimed standing up will you keep these immature ephebes seated and silent or shall i summon someone who can madame girard turned her anger against eloisa brace she was about to continue when her attention was distracted by the extreme awe written on the face of the midget strolling sat cringing looking as madame girard later de scribed him like a kinkajou at noon madame girard studied him closely for a moment and then delivered a resounding kiss as stooping she bent over his mouth she immediately returned to the center of the room to resume speaking but kermit touching himself
hair glistening in the sun then as they watched she vanished where did she go mato cried woman woman teroro called vainly the two young men consulted as to whether they should advise the hawaii from the sun swept lagoon smiled and was relaxed for she was certain that somewhere out beyond the coral she would encounter her personal god mano the wild blue shark mano she cried at last i am coming to talk with you and she was carried far from land when dawn rose accompanied by new explosions of ash and flame king tamatoa studied his stricken community and he could explain the ravages especially the fallen temple planted alive at three of the corners but teroro would not tolerate such reasoning we are punished because we forgot our most ancient goddess and because we built in the wrong place he insisted how wrong the place was would now be proved for mato came running with the news that up on the side of the mountain a creeping wall of fire was slowly descending toward the settlement a dozen men went back into the trees and climbed toward where mato had pointed and they saw a fearful thing above them and marching over all obstacles on its way to the sea came a relentless wall of fiery rock and molten lava turning over and over upon itself devouring trees and rocks and valleys its ugly snout thirty feet high was not ablaze and seemed dead until it struck a dried tree whereupon flames leaped mysteriously into the air at intervals long tongues of molten rock spurted through the ominously creeping front and spread out like water it was it will be upon us by tomorrow the men calculated when he was satisfied with the news king tamatoa reacted without fear for his brother s bold words had strengthened him he commanded we will first pray for the old woman teura and he blessed her to the gods when this was finished he said calmly all planted things will be dug up immediately and wrapped carefully even if you must use your own clothes then he showed the slaves how to load the canoe and when at a distance of less than three miles the molten lava began pouring over a low cliff like a flaming waterfall he studied it for a long time then he said we will stay ashore tonight and get all things ready in the morning we will leave this place pa says he has found a promising land to the west through the night the settlers worked seeing one another in the dim flares ready to go they had recovered much of their seed and had saved their gods their pigs and their canoe with these they escaped but when they were safe at sea they saw the vast fiery front of the lava break through onto their plateau where it ate its way impersonally across all things the temple site was burned away in a flash the fields where crops had rested were gone the taro patch was filled with fire and the cave disappeared behind a wall of flame from the plateau the cascade of fire found a valley leading down into the sea and after building its strength aloft it plunged down this avenue and poured into the ocean when it struck the water it hissed and groaned it threw columns of steam into the air and exploded the waves it sent noisy reports of its triumph and filled the sky with ash and then conquered by the patient and accommodating ocean t fell silently into dark caverns as it the men of havaiki seeing for the first time the incredible fury of which their new land was capable sat awestruck in their canoe and watched for a long time the cataclysm that had destroyed their home but a gust of wind stronger than the rest carried down from the crest of the volcano a wisp of hair spun by the breezes from the molten lava and teroro caught the hair and held it aloft where the sun played on it and he saw that it was the hair which the strange woman in the forest had worn and he announced it was the goddess pere she came not to frighten us but to warn us we did not understand his words gave the people in the canoe great hope for if the goddess had thought enough of her erring people to warn them she must retain some love for them and all was not lost the hair of pere was given to the king as an omen and sow because if this animal did not live and deliver her litter it would be as bad an omen as the volcano in this manner but bearing only half the cargo with which they had arrived and a bred sow clothed in pere s hair the voyagers started for a new home and pa and mato had chosen wisely for they led their companions around the southern tip of the island and up the western coast until they found fine land with soil that could be tilled and water and it was here that the settlement of havaiki began in earnest with new fields and a new temple built without sacrifices when the sow threw her litter the king himself watched over the young pigs and when the largest and strongest reached a size at which he could have been eaten and mouths had begun to water for the taste of roast pig the king and old tupuna carried the pig reverently to the new temple and sacrificed it to lane from then on tupuna took the steps which were to give it the characteristics which marked it permanently he said one day to the king soon i shall follow teura but before i go upon the rainbow we ought to protect the life of ur people it is not good
hi face it was a big tired face tonight and shel noticed for the first time that the eyes which in daylight appeared deep blue were hooded with a film of white mount s question was in order he was asking for information but there was some slight at stake drinking the water somebody else hauled did nt have the right to come by information so easy or to care so little which way the answer went do nt he know he s asking us about how we plan to live and die do nt he know that when he says reasonable that way he s like a man watching a fight and egging the fighters on shel ha no idea what was in his own face but some of his thoughts must have shown for tom mount s face pinked up a little and his eyes shel s finally unveiled while shel was unraveling his own thoughts about tom moun lute cope gave mount his answer you got any better plan tom how about fighting if there was going to be a fight lute cope was the man in shel s opinion who ought to head it up he was the right age shel supposed him to be ten years his senior he was better educated him the ins and outs of people and he had his own land which meant he had his own money and his own future to think about too shel did nt intend to take a back seat unless he saw a man clearly marked to be up front he thought cope was that man and he was ready to enlist under him there were other men on the tract he admired raunce was a hard worker but crazy as a grasshopper and spitting bible texts like tobaccojuice asa brice was in some ways another oddity though what was odd about minding your own business growing sweet potatoes instead of oranges and watching birds instead of courting girls he could nt say it was this last that made him wonder any man past twenty not married or trying to marry struck him as a halfway suicide that man either had been scamped in his make up or he lacked imagination either way shel did nt fathom him he wondered some about tom mount anyway he did nt strike him as a bachelor there were plenty of people who took wendlin jessup to be the tract s leading citizen but wendlin was too calm and easygoing he d make a joke of anything if you had to lose be on wendlin s side he d teach you how to smile while eating crow i do nt plan on needing that knowledge shel thought base cudlip on the other hand did nt have a calm easygoing bone in his body shel looked across the tent to where base sat reared up amidst his younguns like a crested cock the man had rubbed him the wrong way they were from the same state and shel worked against his instincts to give the man his due what s the matter with you he asked himself you want to be the only kaintuck crowing on the dung heap ben jessup was maybe the best man he d ever known shel had a lot of respect for goodness himself on jesus christ which might fit him for the pulpit but not for leading a fight for water his model being one who had turned water into wine might give ben the idea a miracle would serve here shel did nt think they could afford to bank on it no lute cope was the man and shel having elected him was on the point of giving him the news and giving him his hand too saying captain i m lieutenant shelby lewis reporting for duty in his own struggle toward self reliance shel could still use a model he had a bump of veneration on his skull he had a yearning for nobility he could accept he d had to the meanness and nastiness of the human race but by god what he hankered for was a man who could rise up steadfast in the face of it and conquer it he was still hurt admit it or not by that old he was still hunting examples to refute him men whose lives would say to him shel you do nt have to be a man like your pappy shel made a halfway motion of his hand to touch lute get his attention and say plainly what was on his mind i m behind you lute i m backing you up you can depend on me but by the time he d steeled himself to be so outspoken lute was busy with two ladies who were asking him if the seats on the other side of tom mount were being saved shel looked up into the faces of eunice fry and opal tetford i was saving them for press and hannah lute reluctant to seem discourteous said hesitantly opal was equally reluctant to have lute blaming himself there s lots of other seats lute do nt you worry the meeting had obviously excited these ladies the chance for a little party had gone to was not much more noticeable than a tree or an outcropping of stone was all ablaze a tree on fire or an outcropping blasted open to show a vein of gold shel stared at her forgetting to introduce his family he was abashed before so open a display of feeling he felt he should warn her that the occasion was not up to it that starting out at this pitch she was in for a disappointment she had her excuses he knew those two ladies had been living a hard lonely life doing a man s work in getting their land cleared and their house raised still this was a meeting for water it was nt christmas
as inexplicable as it was profoundly moving cliff had not been tidy she might have written down in the record book but her hand had not even moved in the direction of the pen he was accustomed to leave things in the middle of the floor had no fixed place for any of his belongings and therefore never remembered where anything was often he would put a soiled shirt or pair of them or find them for six weeks or half a year later more often than not he lost his cufflinks and never found them again so that in her absence he or boyd would be compelled to sew buttons on the impractical french cuffs he had lost two wrist watches and since he always lost gloves he gave up wearing them alma often wondered what had happened to him in the army where he perforce must have had to be neat orderly prompt and in line perhaps cliff had learned to be all these things in the army alma decided boyd had hinted as much and then they had been informed he had been awarded the purple heart a phrase that froze her with nausea and again alma caught herself thinking about her nephew in the present in what she had once seen described somewhere as the specious present she felt often confusing time that cliff was both at home with her and in the army she and sit down to supper with her and boyd and the next moment she was waiting to receive a letter from his apo address the clock in the east room chimed how odd how terrifying and yet how soothing she thought putting down the record book that time runs out first we are here she said to herself being this sort of person and then so little later we have lost all track of that time and who we were then until some trifle brings us back to that period for a brief lightning illumined second then back again to the now daily scandal sheet boyd greeted her with his customary early evening remark putting down the sentinel in alma s lap sometimes she responded to this hackneyed greeting in a feminine pleased way again in a crabbed half audible grunt today this late afternoon half dozing in her confused memories of time and the nephew she merely moistened her lips saying nothing everything all right boyd asked faintly she replied in her scolding voice then she stopped to discover if she did need anything indeed i ll go up the street for them in just a minute he made use of her indecision we need cooking oil i am almost sure she began to enumerate some cheese to go with the pie that is if you d like pie he had gone to the door that led off the sitting room while she was making her list opened it and vanished from behind the door she could hear him urinating tonight she did not even resent the sound which often made her irritable during the entire supper hour the falling spray of his water suddenly meant nothing to her ile came out with his right hand still touching his fly shall i write down the list of things she made her same daily query to him and her hands clasped one another i got it all hand touched his hat which he had just put on you might bring back some whipping cream she said as a last minute addition is that the works then she nodded when he had finally gone she suddenly remembered she had not heard him flush the toilet studying for a moment the tiny door leading off the sitting room she walked slowly over to it opened it and went into the closet looked down into the bowl and flushed quickly she decided to wash her hands in the kitchen where there was a fresh cake of verbena soap she washed her hands slowly and deliberately like a surgeon allowing a thick suds to reach as far as her wrists rinsing them she dried them on a tiny face towel embroidered with violets which had belonged to her mother often in the evening they made a practise of turning out all the lights and sitting in the dark talking those who passed by outside might watching television how ever they had no set neither boyd nor alma having the least desire to have to watch as well as to hear something which probably in the end could concern them very little once they were seated in the dark the emptiness and timelessness of the present receded a little in this special prepared dark their ages became ambiguous and they might therefore have belonged again to any vigorous decade of their lives as they talked to one another in the dark it even seemed to them that they were living their entire lives all at once and were in command of their total personalities friends and relatives long dead entered into their conversation and the hard implacable void of contemporaneity was dissipated one could so to speak see land breathe air the night had lifted from night the sound of the blue jays piercing cry always meant that morning was far advanced in a half hour or so after the jays cried one would hear the how cliff had sometimes come in from his work on the yard or some other household chore for a bite to eat and the jays had called sharply each time he came into the house closing the screen door behind him cliff would you enjoy a dish of fresh strawberries she could hear her own voice coming to her out of the recesses of the years coming back to the present she stood over the kitchen table looking down at the recipe for parker house rolls for she had decided to present a baker s dozen of these as a
slopes they would have ridden in discomfort the marks at the entrance of the valley had gone in only one direction they had not come out therefore he said the squad should continue the march up the defile matthew gave the command accordingly joe dummy turned his mouth down in a sour expression it concealed his satisfaction that his young commander reposed trust in his judgment in the care of their study of the trail the column had taken almost three hours to o clock in the morning a late august day and the light was turning from golden to white as the day advanced the heat was already wavering off the desert crust in visible reflections and dust was hanging forward on the drying wind out of mexico many miles away the defile was pale in color dust lay on the rocks that jutted from the low slopes until from some distance the rocks looked like rags of cloth or paper in the beating light and the grass made a ragged shimmer grass crushed by hoofs gave up a wry piercing odor ahead of them the hills time after time folded away any distant view but revealed with every turn of a fold another stretch of the low valley that showed nothing new dusty rocks in random attitudes the only surfaces to catch the light and make pale interruptions of the dusty olive green of the sharp grassed slopes there said joe riding beside matthew with a movement of his crabbed arm where joe took the light like the outcropping rocks of the whole passage and yet somehow did not look quite the same matthew leaned sharply forward and halted the column with a hand signal various pale objects about sixty five yards ahead nothing in his experience prepared him to know what they might be even remembering all the possibilities which had brought him here but if lieutenant hazard had never seen dead naked and hacked bodies lying to catch the sunlight under a dusty white sky in a desert defile joe dummy had and often he knew what he saw the lieutenant knew too soon enough so did his men the column approached at a walk the works left by murderers no soldier said anything except a young pennsylvanian and he said with sudden vomit what his mouth could not frame in words matthew glanced at him and said cranshaw dismount here and wait for us the trooper shaking in his pallor nodded and came to a halt they with his horse s bridle caught around his right ankle it was most curious thought matthew even as he drew ahead with his attention fixed on what they had come to find most curious how unsafe it was to predict what any given man might do in situations of unaccustomed difficulty cranshaw was robust well favored seemingly confident he was liked in the platoon he had a stock of jokes and farces and he gave freely of them to entertain his fellows when offered alcohol he drank readily and was drunk sooner than anyone and then more droll than ever he was much applauded for his blithe obscenities and music hall turns matthew had already marked him for possible promotion for he was quick and clever at his tasks and men learned from his demonstrations at these now at the sight of mutilated death he failed the rest showing them an example of weakness matthew reserved his judgment cranshaw perhaps must simply get used to what now the other men saw in immediate clarity dismounted matthew went forward alone with joe dummy yes this was how all was proper nothing had been neglected so joe dummy seemed to say as he took in the scene if he held views about the death of sergeant blickner who had abused him he did not reveal them matthew was more slow in accumulating all the details the victims were naked their limbs were severed from their bodies and slightly scattered the woman s body showed a mortal mercy powder burns close on her breast indicated that sergeant blickner had shot her before she could be taken prisoner his own flesh showed bullet wounds of farther origin and lance and knife cuts further specifications of unspeakable treatment suffered by the two corpses would be reserved for the official report to the commanding officer of fort delivery matthew decided he was pale his lips were white and felt stretched he turned to his troopers and said trumpeter hold the horses the rest of you men came trumpeter rainey holding the squad s bridles craned his neck a sense of injustice possessed him in due time it was relieved for the lieutenant ordered the men back and permitted him to come forward in his turn he was the youngest man in the detachment matthew watched him study the recognizable pieces on the ground the trumpeter closed his jaws and squeezed down his eyes almost shut in his hardened face he looked twice his age for a moment then he glanced at the lieutenant and nodded and the effect was of his saying that it was the worst thing you ever could see but if you had seen and felt anything of life before this was something you just had to put along with all the rest of it good and bad to keep on going yourself rainey said matthew go back and bring cranshaw up here if he wants to see before we decide what to do next look s sir said rainey saluting as he went he was more of a stylist at soldiering than the rest matthew moved aside with joe dummy how were they how many and where have they gone he asked so this and this they were about four in number and they were mounted they now had two extra horses along with whatever arms and ammunition the sergeant had carried and all equipment including saddles and food and
he took the steps three at a time he scrambled up the stairway faster than the elevator could have made it even if its operator had not been under instructions as hugh was convinced he was to have a breakdown somewhere en route at the landing of his floor hugh took out his and skidded around a corner stopped in his tracks his gun was held waist high and pointed at the round belly of chu hoong creator of dragon s tooth elixir multimillionaire and it just so happened owner of the imperial hotel in bangkok where his orders could move any and all members of the hotel staff the chinese looked at north impassively glanced down at the snub nosed revolver with the same bland unconcern the almond eyes returned to hugh s and there was a faint smile on the small mouth over the goatee am ito understand that this is a robbery mr boyden chu asked gently no up my invitations with something solid to show my sincerity i m inviting you now to visit mr barrows room with me chu s smile widened that would be delightful he said as a matter of fact i ve just come from there i had an idea you had north grunted i trust you left him in good health the chinese turned shrugging i presume he was in good health at least he was in good voice he seemed disturbed but of course it was hard to tell speaking to him through the door as i did through the door ah yes he is somewhat strange this mr barrows is he not he may have reason to be where you re concerned mr chu the g man said his pistol muzzle never wavering perhaps what you said to him through the door was upsetting see why it should have been he said smoothly i merely called to inquire if everything was satisfactory as i make it a practice to inquire of all the imperial s guests when i am in bangkok he smiled over his shoulder at north the personal touch you know i got the idea from reading about your so successful american hotel operators i can imagine hugh north smiled back they reached the door of room and the colonel rapped i said go away bracht s voice was gruff but now it was hoarse strained go away chu or whatever you call yourself by god if you do nt i ll i ll get somebody who ll make you go away sounds as if he s ready to co operate with me north told himself for which heaven be praised it s me boyden he called aloud are you all right bracht s voice sounded again relief dripping yes yes i m all right i slammed the door on him when i saw who it was that little devil he ll stop at nothing he he ll kill me before i get to it s all right hugh cut in hastily i ll be with you in a minute sit tight throughout this chu hoong had stood there with a small compassionate smile on his rosebud mouth now he whispered i understand the poor man is ill eh or he drinks unwisely and that is why you have to care for him poor fellow north backed to his door used his key to open it the gestured and chu hoong placidly walked into room his eyes roamed the room and he clucked his tongue you see why it is wise for me to personally check on the comfort of my guests mr boyden faded they should have been replaced one ca nt trust servants in these days no matter what one pays them he walked to the easy chair in the corner near the window and calmly seated himself laced his fingers across his watermelon stomach and regarded hugh north half humorously if you are that poor man s keeper you deserve an explanation he said more than that you deserve a million apologies from this miserable bungler i did not know mr barrows was ill they should have told me down at the desk suppose hugh suggested we speak cantonese and please go slowly i am not very good at it a generous gesture chu singsonged in cantonese the genuine knight meets another s embarrassing inability to speak his language correctly by changing to the unscholared one s dialect truly a splendid example of manners i want to speak cantonese so the one in the next room now chu hoong why do you fear henry barrows a veil descended over chu s eyes a veil colonel north had seen come down over a thousand chinese eyes and seldom had been able to pierce it is unforgivable to contradict a guest but i must chu said humbly i do not fear mr barrows if it did not sound like the boasting of a worm i would tell you that i do not fear any human i saw fear in your eyes when you met barrows on the air plane you did honorable guest then if you thought you did you did for what a man thinks he sees is true in his mind consider the man who loves an ugly woman love makes him see a beautiful woman and so she is beautiful and who can say she is not not this insignificant one he unclasped his hands long enough to point a sharp nailed index finger at his chest you who will harm your patient honorable guest and so to you i am a menace but try to see me only as an innkeeper who desires that his guests have comfort and succeeding in that you will find no demon only an old and weary man who is ashamed that his oversolicitude disturbed an ill person he bowed his head his face woebegone what can i do to repair this thoughtless error he asked you
ket deal i m putting over or what it is and i do nt want to know i just want the best i can get for the two of them for neapolitano virgilia and the mare i guess i do nt care if i m breaking some kind of law herr jaeger i guess it s come to that he moved away from the station wagon window and he laid his small gloved hand on jaeger s forearm just look inside there and you ll see the hay you can see it ca nt you he said he had drawn jaeger forward to look through the glass at the greenish sprays that lay on the station wagon boards it but scarcely enough for a week s feed maybe you heard about the horse fair they re holding in kneith in september dardenella said almost laughing in his eagerness christoph horn and me we re going down there may be a lipizzaner up on the block we got a tip i do nt want to say too much but we re going down to have a look that would make three but a horse like that a lipizzaner jaeger said he sought the right american phrase it would cost you a million yes a million a cool million dardenella said and he liked the sound of it so much that he stood there laughing looking up at jaeger from under the tilted brim of the tan straw stetson his soft mouth warm and dark with his secrets his teeth clear white as he laughed you see how it is do nt you herr jaeger hay only you understand i would nt want the colonel to know there was no question that it was hay jaeger had seen it in the square of light that the kitchen window cast on the station wagon floor but when dardenella had driven away there was something else frau knau was busy in the kitchen as they came in bearing the tall brown commissary bags in her arms lifting them from the table and carrying them one by one because of the weight to the closet underneath the stairs guten abend herr jaeger she said her voice and face entirely serene come help me walter to clear all this away there was no sign of it left by the time the colonel s party drove into the courtyard frau knau and walter had gone upstairs to bed half an hour before the twin stream of the headlights moved across the windows and swung like the shafts of a lighthouse beacon toward the pigsty jaeger had sat alone in the kitchen of the waiting silent house and now he put out the end of his cigarette and stood up from the table it was not quite ten o clock as the colonel and knau came through the door there s been some trouble jaeger the colonel said shortly can you tell me where my daughter is it might have been something to laugh at the fact that she was gone again if the look in the colonel s face had been different but the flush of drink the fire of energy were gone from it and he stood there haggard brooding old behind him knau closed the door against the warmth and the involvement of the outdoor dark his shoulders wooden as he moved his eyes under the black hat s brim blinking numbly in the light she was with lieutenant stephany jaeger began but the colonel cut him short yes somewhere during that time she gave lieutenant stephany the slip he does nt even know which way she went jaeger watched a pulse beating in his left jaw as the colonel felt in his trouser pocket and brought out a handful of crumpled bills and coins you gave my wife some german lessons i do nt remember how many but take what i owe you out of this i m wiping all my blackboards clean when he threw the money down on the table two or three coins rolled over the edge and across the floor take out for the interpreting too he said but nobody moved nobody spoke knau dared not cast so much as a glance at the coins on the floor sensing it may have been the presence of something more final than money in the kitchen with them now i ll go upstairs and ask the wife he said when he moved the colonel did likewise mounting vaguely almost willessly where the forester led perhaps for no better reason than because he did not know where else to go and jaeger not having relinquished yet the interpreter s role followed after them the upper hall was lit by one banging unshaded bulb and they passed under it in single file jaeger stooping a little so that he would not strike it with his head knau his back and shoulders rigid turned the knob of the first door even when he entered the bedroom the colonel followed him doggedly blindly his mind and anger somewhere else his step that of an older broken man jaeger paused only an instant on the threshold and then he followed behind the colonel into the room knau had switched on a light on the dresser and along the east wall the beds could be seen now four of them to judge from the wooden headboards but the four of them pushed together to form pure white featherbeds ballooned in the half obscurity and long white bolsters propped the sleeping heads frau knau s was first she lay a little in from the edge leaving space it might be for knau to lie beside her when his labors would be done he would take off his boots and lay aside his ceremonious black slip the suspenders free from his shoulders lay his pants across a chair and with no more than this as preparation for the night he
the lecco factory made she was astonished when he explained that it produced most of the steel wire used in italy for making the spokes of bicycle and motorcycle wheels it also made most of the metal stripping used for umbrella ribs asked about the relative quantities of these products she was open mouthed at his replies they might not seem large in the united states she said but they were enormous here yes he nodded an umbrella was a joke in a sense but italian umbrellas in recent years had become a large export like thousands of other small manufactured articles and the cycle industry was no trifle by any measure much of his wheel spoke production went up the lake to mandello to the big motorcycle works which employed so much of the labour of the region suddenly he glanced at her and said how should you be interested in such things why do you know enough to ask questions about industry oh i do nt know much she said but i ve been taught what one needs to understand for what a woman the constant images he laughed money darling how can one understand investments if one does nt know anything he said again shaking his head what have you to do with investments i manage my own he was incredulous how can you he said almost jeering well i was made to by my grandmother have nt you ever heard that more than half the invested money in the united states belongs to women heard it he said jerking his head but who could believe it well it s true and my grandmother was the only child of a rugged old roughneck who made his money in mining oh it s all such ancient history carlo no go on i m fascinated what kind of mining he was no longer driving like a racer copper lead silver various gambles in nevada and colorado he left it all to his daughter and she really had a head for business which grandmother then why have you the money what about your father harriet sighed this was the sort of thing she knew no italian would understand and would disapprove with his whole soul if he could understand my father she said well my grandmother did nt think much of him i suppose it was her own fault she brought him up but the way he turned out she simply left him an allowance to live on and left her money to me with directions that i was to be taught to take care of it carlo s face was a study harriet was not sure whether he was more astonished or more affronted marcia davenport i m sorry she said with a little laugh i know it sounds horrifying here but it s not the least peculiar in the united states and where is your father now he lives in mexico i thought your parents were in she said resigned do nt make me spell it all out carlo everybody s been divorced and remarried on and off the merry go round and she looked at him with an expression which moved him sharply i loathe it poveretta he murmured compared with your lives here it s a shambles but if you were pina he said with sudden pungency if you had pina s life to live you d have divorced me long ago that s what i did she said quietly and here i am there pina is oh look carlo is that bergamo yes but do nt look down there to your right that s bergamobassa modern bergamo look up there he pointed to the left where the soft pinkish mass of an ancient town clung gently moulded to the shoulder of a mountain bergamo alta town is unspoilt and the modern one has room to grow and your factories here basta factories i m hungry tell me what you ve got here she insisted you made me talk one of his factories made cylindrical steel products he said drums and tubing and such for the chemical industry another made metallic parts for small machinery anything which moved or turned or rolled electrical appliances for instance but an infinity of things how many coffee grinders do you suppose are the constant image manufactured in italy and we make the ratchet gears for most of them gears for any kind of small machine and now he said swinging the car to the left and starting up a long climbing street keep quiet because i am worn out with talking and i want my lunch the street rose towards the upper town branching at its end right and left he followed the right hand turn the gateway in the old city wall to let another car come through harriet looked at the lion of san marco on the arch and asked whether bergamo too had been part of the venetian republic for three hundred years it was the westermost part it was fortified then all this was walled it is fortified still she reflected in its own beauty she had seen many of the celebrated hill cities of italy and learnt their histories with more than the usual tourist s interest but this of which she had heard nobody speak in the same terms as assisi arezzo gubbio todi orvieto had its own quality of wholly unexpected enchantment perhaps that was lombard she wondered why looking at the shuttered houses squeezing the narrow streets their faded tints soft as cushions that one might reach out and touch the shops were closed the streets deserted the people had eaten and were shut in their houses resting carlo drove past the piazza where the whose gracefulness and intimacy made harriet think this looks like a cosy place but she said nothing he swept round back of the piazza and stopped before a very old house faded to a creamy sandy
many times i could almost repeat it by rote fellow citizens he said clearing his throat his was a good voice and he knew how to use it against the hiss of the gas jets and the rustle of people and their breathing his words came hard and sharp with great conviction i wish to deal tonight with the sad and lamentable case of the last voyage of sir john franklin and his ships erebus and terror to they were listening well i see among you many scientific men men who have visited the arctic as i have and explored there i know they are acquainted with the facts but for you others whose support i seek i will restate the facts in may of some eighteen years past sir john franklin set sail from england on a voyage of exploration with a total of a hundred and twenty nine men aboard his two ships in the latter part of july of that year the ships were seen in the vicinity of lancaster sound north of baffin island at a north latitude of almost degrees never more were they seen by civilized man it was a dramatic and impressive start he went on telling about the relief expeditions that had been organized to search for the vanished ships sir james ross mcclintock and the rest and explained why he thought they had failed warming to his task he demanded and party can they be yet alive some of them living in hardship and peril in the frozen north this was his chief point of course he went on to tell them about himself his studies his correspondence his obsession with the arctic and his recent expedition there for the past ten years i have studied this riddle i have read everything that has been published on the subject i have corresponded with lady franklin herself who is as anxious as i am to find the answer i believe i am now on the right track now was the time to ask for funds to press home on the note of american enterprise and intelligence now taking over where other nations had failed but a disturbance arose in the audience a voice called out a voice casual but authoritative mr hall it was professor thorne he dangled his pince nez from its ribbon and it swung ominously in the gas flare giving have been kind enough to invite me to attend your talk this evening i thank you for this courtesy he smiled and looked down at the swinging spectacles but for this courtesy i am bound to extend to you a similar one my opinion of your theories sir said mr hall i am not quite finished if you will bear with me no matter said thorne there is little more to be said anyway the whole subject has been exhausted someone tittered and the audience rustled in anticipation of a diversion thorne was well known as an extemporaneous speaker and a wit mr hall held up his hand to silence the growing buzz of comment only a moment mr hall said thorne his voice rising you have wasted my time sir and the time of these good people i think this is a calculated fraud trading on the good will is no longer a puzzle and has not been for some years it is well established that all those unfortunate men have perished what good will it do to suggest further risk of life and financial expense what can be done now that has not already been done by well qualified arctic experts mr hall became angry i will tell you sir so far what has been deduced a meager theory from scant evidence so long as there is a possibility that one of those unfortunate men is still alive why should not attempts be made again and again until all the facts are known are there not esquimaux now living in those frozen lands why is it not possible for some of the franklin survivors to be living there also eating esquimaux food the raw flesh of seal and deer dressed in furs sustaining life day by day and waiting for delivery it is hardly possible thorne said a white man could not stomach is not used to it but i have done it mr hall fairly roared the words to one educated otherwise as we whites are feasting on uncooked meats is repulsive but i say eating meats raw or cooked is entirely a matter of education uproar fed on uproar and several troublemakers began to catcall and stamp their feet others wishing to avoid trouble rose and started to leave the hall only a moment mr hall begged wait there is a box at the door for your contributions mr flail professor thorne shouted i can not allow you to appeal for funds for such a project without it being understood what your qualifications are you are not a scientist nor ever have been you are not educated or trained in this field and have made one short trip north that due only to the kindness and generosity of williams and haven the whaling firm you propose to ignore the experts in this field you propose another wild goose chase to the arctic wasting the money of well meaning citizens to satisfy your own morbid curiosities no sir i can not countenance this nor will i sir you are a humbug and an impostor wait a minute mr hall held his hands high in supplication but the damage had been done wait a minute please all of you listen to what i have to say tittering started a cruel tittering that grew into guffaws and jeers sir said professor thorne with finality i am very sorry for you he turned and walked out followed by dr beckett others joined in the exodus please listen to me hurrying down from the stage mr hall took an arm
in town she kept her stomach flat and her chin line taut a goodly part of her income went to hair nails massage creams and unguents other women said she must be older than she looks when supporting muscles of her breasts no longer responded to creams massage and exercise she placed them in shapely forms that rode high and jauntily her make up took increasing time her hair had all the sheen luster wave the television products promise on a date dining dancing laughing amusing drawing her escort with a net of small magnets who could know her cold sense of repetition after a decent interval and an outlay of money she usually went to bed with him if she discreetly could then back to her fence mending sooner or later the shared bed must be the trap to catch her future security and ease but the prospective game leaped clear of the quilted jaws more and more of her dates were the married the infirm or the cautious running out the tarot cards did not respond when she sought help for herself margie had known many men most of them guilty wounded in their vanity or despairing so that she had developed a contempt for her quarry as a professional hunter of vermin does it was easy to move such men through their fears and their vanities they ached so to be fooled that she no longer felt triumph only a kind of disgusted pity these were her friends and associates she protected them even from the discovery that they were her friends she gave them the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her she kept them secret because at the bottom she did not admire herself danny taylor was one of these and alfio marullo another and chief stonewall jackson smith a third and there were others they trusted her and she them and their secret existence was the one warm honesty to which she could retire to restore herself these friends talked freely and without fear of andersen s well receptive unjudging and silent as most people have secret vices margie young hunt concealed a secret virtue and because of this quiet thing it is probable that she knew more about new baytown and even wessex county than anyone and her knowledge was unwarped because she would not could not use it for her own profit but in other fields everything that came to her hand was usable her project ethan allen hawley began casually and out of idleness in a way he was correct in thinking it was mischievous a testing of her power many of the sad men who came to her for comfort and reassurance were hogtied with impotence bound and helpless in sexual traumas that infected all other areas of their lives and she found it easy by small flatteries and reassurances to set them free to fight again against their whip armed wives she was genuinely fond of mary hawley and through her she gradually became aware of ethan bound in another kind of trauma certainty having no work no love no children she wondered whether she could release and direct this crippled man toward some new end it was a game a kind of puzzle a test a product not of kindness but simply of curiosity and idleness this was a superior man to direct him would prove her superiority and this she needed increasingly probably she was the only one who knew the depth of the change in ethan and it frightened her because she thought it was her doing the mouse was growing a lion s mane she saw the muscles under his clothes felt ruthlessness growing behind his eyes so must the gentle einstein have felt when his dreamed concept of the nature of matter flashed over hiroshima margie liked mary hawley very much and she had little sympathy and no pity for her misfortune is a fact of nature acceptable to women especially when it falls on other women in her tiny immaculate house set in a large overgrown garden very mirror to inspect her tools and her eyes saw through cream powder eye shadowing and lashes sheathed in black saw the hidden wrinkles the inelasticity of skin she felt the years creep up like the rising tide about a rock in a calm sea there is an arsenal of maturity of middle age but these require training and technique she did not yet have she must learn them before her structure of youth and excitement crumbled and left her naked rotten ridiculous her success had been that she never let down even alone now as an experiment she allowed her mouth to droop as it wanted to her eyelids to fall half staff shep lowered her high held chin and a plaited rope came into being before her in the mirror she saw twenty years clamber over her and she shuddered as the icy whispering told her what lay waiting she had delayed too long a woman must have a showcase in which to grow old lights props and pilfering love protection and small change a serene and undemanding husband or his even more serene and less demanding will and trust fund a woman growing old alone is useless cast off trash a wrinkled obscenity with no hobbled retainers to cluck and mutter over her aches and to rub her pains a hot spot of fear formed in her stomach she had been lucky in her first husband he was weak and she soon found the valve of his weakness he was hopelessly in love with her so much so that when she needed a divorce he did not ask for a remarriage clause in his alimony settlement her second husband thought she had a private fortune and so she had he did nt leave her much when he died but with the alimony from her first husband she could live decently dress
recall and clean and charming the chair by the goldfishbowl which i quickly appropriated as my old man chair where i sat constantly sipping port for a whole week the kitchen with its intelligent arrangements of spices and eggs in the icebox and for that matter too the poor little son of billie sleeping in a well arranged back room her son from her deceased husband who was also a railroadman elliott the child s name and i did nt get to see him till later that night and with the huge packet of cody s san quentin letters in her hand she launches forth on her theories about cody and eternity but all i can keep saying as i swig from my bottle is julien you re talking too much julien julien my god who d ever dream i d run into a woman who looks like julien you look like julien but you re not julien and on top of that you re a woman how goddam strange in fact she had to pack me off to bed drunk but not before being absolutely true but the main thing being that tho she looked like julien etc and had cody s big sad abstract letters about karma in a ribbon and actually went out in the morning and earned a hundred a week in fashion modeling she had the most musical beautiful and sad voice i ve ever heard in my life the things she s saying are really rather inane because after all her education is based on really californian hysterias like the earlier mistress of cody rosemarie who also was thin and pale haired and crazy and kept talking abstract like she s saying i thought i could do something to ease the contradiction between immanent and universal ethics which i thought was my problem and was what i hoped to gain thru therapy like any evolution presupposes an involution and all that kind of thinking as i sigh but she does say something interesting once in a while like while cody was in prison my main occupation was praying for him i had an all day going there was also a bit we did together every evening something else is happening i m not sure what but i m sure we aid the storm when we transcend time in one respect and ca nt even keep up with it in others but also all kinds of to me unimportant and uninteresting crap about channels about people being either closed or open channels and cody is a big open channel pouring out all his holy gysm on heaven i really cant remember or the destinies the sighs the rooftops of all that the stars are shining down on their poor heads as they draw breath to explain inanities really like the letters to her i glance at them are all about how they ve met and their souls have collided in this dimension because of some unfulfilled karma on another planet and in another plane that is and now they have to gird themselves to assume this big responsibility to meet some measure of this and that i do nt even wanta go into it because also the fact of the matter being when willamine talks to me i sad music of her voice and in the strange circumstance i guess karma like too that she looks like poor julien her voice is the main point she talks with a broken heart her voice lutes brokenly like a heart lost musically too like in a lost grove it s almost too much to bear sometimes like some fantastic futuristic jerry southern singer in a night club who steps up to the mike in the spotlight in las vegas but does nt even have to sing just talk to make men sigh and women wonder i guess if women ever wonder so that as she s trying to explain all that nonsense to me all that philosophy of hers and cody s and cody s new buddy perry coming up the next day i just sit and marvel and stare at her mouth wondering where all the beauty is coming from and why and we end up making love sweetly too a little blonde well experienced in all the facets of lovemaking and sweet with compassion and just too much so that b dawn we in a week in fact i can see it now a great big four way marriage with cody and evelyn for she is the great enemy of evelyn she s not satisfied just to be cody s lover and soul heart she wants to go right over there and lay evelyn down on the line and take cody away with her forever and to do this she ll even have a deadend heaven deep love affair with old jack same pattern of old there s not much difference between her and evelyn when you listen to their talk about cody except in evelyn s case i m always fascinatedly interested billie actually bores me tho of course i cant tell her that evelyn is still the champ and i wonder about cody the ups and downs and juggling of women blondes at that all in the great magical city of the gandharvas of san francisco and here i am alone on a magic carpet with one of em whee at first of course it s a great ball a great new eye shattering explosion of experience not dreaming i my arms and my name billie too now billie and billie arm in arm oh beautiful and cody has given his consent in a way we go roaming the genghiz khan clouds of soft love and hope and anybody who s never done this is crazy because a new love affair always gives hope the irrational mortal loneliness is always crowned that thing i saw that horror of snake emptiness when i took
get over their love affair with themselves love affair ah you know you loved it she said spinning out yourself because meanwhile you did nt have to do anything about anything or anybody would it have been better if i d had t b something that showed she put a hand out toward him almost touching his knee then drew it back i kept thinking of them all the time all the wives and husbands and parents of the the time smoothing things over picking up the pieces holding their breath what are we supposed to do stop living if you felt like that why did nt you say some oh no she said quickly i was nt supposed to interrupt or intrude it was true he thought what she had represented these three years had been the damaging real which he had avoided even as he fought his way toward it i know it has nt been easy for you he said humbly perhaps that was part of my trouble that i did nt think enough about that but now what s now she looked down at her clenched hands people like me will always be on the outside with people like you he got up heavily from the bed and crossed to the window god save us he thought us and see it whole from those who ca nt bury or evade the truth but have to drag it out and beat it like a carpet who can say the raw the open thing that can never be glozed over again he stared out the window twisting one hand around and around in his pants pocket come on he said let s go up to the ewarts no i do nt want to go after all well for god s sake he said sore with his new effort you re always the one who s trying to drag me because it was better than being alone together she shrugged smiling crookedly up at him besides saturday night one always hopes for the best come on then he met the smile with a placating one of his own no it s just you know she said like a record we all play once a week jim hanging around waiting for esther to get drunk enough so she ll go home and karen watching lou for her reasons and me watching you for mine i just do nt want any part of it any more he watched it almost jealously that soft flexible look of hers which concealed the enviable certitude the stubborn strength to reject to decide well what do you want to do she looked away from him consciously i thought i d go back home for a while if you re really on your feet now for a while or for good he said for good he thought that s what she asked only a little while ago she was silent what makes you think utica or any other place is nt more of the same these days where i just ca nt go on being an adjunct any more and libby he softened his voice suddenly as if their joint concern might wake her where their forgetfulness had not she put her head down in her hands rubbing her concealed face back and forth she ll cry now he thought although he could not remember when he had last seen her cry and he waited almost with relief for with women the lucky women this meant the dissolving of an issue the haggled end of emotion but she went on defeatedly rocking come on he said after a moment i ll fix us a drink he waited and then put a hand on her shoulder we ll have a party by ourselves in the kitchen his hands took over the mixing of the martinis picking out and combining the gin the vermouth the lemon peel with disembodied competence he thought is nt it is nt it he said defensively to the dry voice in the anonymous room he thought of the crowd upstairs now at the ewarts in the pattern as dorothy had said pooling all their uncertainties of the week drowning them in the fabricated bonhomie of saturday night the ewarts syl and harry were a few years older than the average couple in the building and were both in business perhaps it was a combination of these facts which led them into great spurts of energy in which droves of people must be enlisted to help them kill the weekend s frightening acreage of time to their coarse grained parties there came patronizingly the fledgling physicists the writers on their way to a foothold the confused but verbose young men with their foetally promising jobs in the government in the state department or like himself in the universities they came because they were at loose ends or at odds with of the city or let it be said because the ewarts could serve the liquor they themselves could infrequently afford and with each of them came the wife in the new hair do the primary colored dress with its attempted primary appeal all the intelligent frustrated girls fleeing from the diapers toward an evening in which they could forget their altered conceptions of themselves he held the martini mixer up to the light and stirred forestalling the thought of dorothy and himself with critical thoughts of the others it s true what she said he thought esther having to drink herself into insensibility more and more often with jim doggedly watching and karen flitting grimly unobtrusively into the kitchen now and then to see that lou s reflex skirt chasing does nt get him in more trouble than he can handle and me wrapped up in a corner for once let s not think about me he said defiantly to the voice in the repudiated room and with reassurances to the sufferers administering glasses
know how you ve been you ve been fine well that would seem to cover that what do you want bill dan has your headquarters boat left left for where the invasion you said there d be one it s not even chartered yet oh i heard the movement had started and it has started but we have nt not this and holding an inauguration and a ball couple of balls all kinds of various things more important than taking the field why i want to be taken on board in what capacity as trader in cotton you are going to buy cotton bill that s the idea dan i have nt told you all about what brought me to town i then sketched it out quick the plan i d made with sandy and my need for twenty five thousand dollars i went on from all that i hear around the quickest way to get money is to join this red river thing seems to be like picking the stuff off trees if you can get on this boat and if you tell me no lies but what lies have i been telling that you re taking this trip to make money well that girl she left for red river last week but listen i need twenty five thousand dollars i know you do bill i know all about it then where does the lie come in bill ever hear of a man named dumont the banker i know him yes he was in asking about you said miss tremaine the lady you brought to the ball was fixing to marry you then sell her business out and back you in another with the money you needed he was for it if you were an honest man but if you already have the twenty five thousand promised it proves you re lying does nt it what did you say about me nice stuff he went away quite happy could be i d rather make that tin myself and could be you d rather have mrs fournet interrupted to know how i could make any tin knowing nothing about cotton at all i said what s to know dan i go on your boat as a trader i pile off at alexandria along with the other traders i buy stock off a reb which i still have money to do i write up my receipt listing bales by mark number and weight i present it to the q m officer making the seizure for him to sign the rest is up to the lawyers is any of that beyond my comprehension bill i ve told you that cotton is hooded hoodooed this is not halloween i m not talking about halloween or anything superstitious all right call it attaindered but i m telling you it ll ruin whoever touches it including you including burke including landry including mrs fournet who s a damned pretty girl mixed up in a damned ugly is trying this army is trying to buy a piece of this war to pay for our invasion by taking traders along by letting them put out tin for the cotton the rebs have in storage i m telling you it ca nt be done there s one piece of land that s never yet been up for sale and that s the half acre you need to plant a flagpole on that you have to take it s a people s maidenhead it wo nt give in by itself and its price is blood it s what we re forgetting but we ll pay the price that price or i m badly mistaken oh our motives are good why the hell would nt they be what motive s not better than war the idea washington thinks is to kill three birds with one stone block the reb government from shipping the cotton abroad and buying guns with it give some individual rebs a lick at the sugar pot northern mills some stock to make shirts with for our soldiers all right but the only time i ever let go at three birds on a limb i broke the dining room window cut my grandfather s head and landed a rock in my mother s soup but this will be worse it s treason why it takes two to make a sale and in a war that means dealing with the enemy the reb army if they let that cotton lay if they fail to burn it when they evacuate alexandria have already heard the word as it s been passed up the line and we if we pass the wink to the owners those rebs licking up sugar as we make the confiscation we re dealing with the enemy too but you say not much just a little bit but i say remember that maidenhead there s no such thing as one that s been slightly took and there s going to be trouble now why i say that cotton is hooded do i have to say more i thought you were my friend dan i m talking as your friend you do nt sound much like it i ll prove it my orders are to pass you pass me you mean to go on that boat yes that s what i mean well why do nt you bill do you know what impressed mr dumont not your annapolis life which i did nt know too much about if i have to tell you the truth but what you did right here that brought him out of his chair for landry are you talking about that s right and it impressed us too who is us this whole headquarters they hated it of course but they respected you for it and and unfortunately might blow this whole ship out of water so the word came to me pass this man in if he wants well if i m
identifying and discarding just such radar signals fail safe the briefing our big operation at omaha of course probably at least one other stand by then there was the president s bomb shelter probably another computerized strategy board layout there maybe there was more than one presidential bomb shelter maybe one at camp david or the summer white house or who knows where else then in addition he knew there was always every minute of every day a converted kc aloft a miniature emergency omaha in case everything else should blow probably another one on some super aircraft carrier somewhere still another on one of the nuclear submarines how many others several in england certainly france perhaps and west germany russia yes surely there would be almost as many as there are in the united states black knew that four kc s were reserved exclusively for presidential use as a flying command post in case of emergency since they had been scattered about the country so that the president was never far from one whenever the president flew overseas one of these planes was quietly and unobtrusively included in his was similar and the men in them too today throughout the world in each one of the big board rooms staffed by busy competent dedicated men probably the same signals were being received analyzed and projected the big brass everywhere was watching similar strategy boards studying the same blips thinking out or talking out the same strategic puzzles groteschele was now discussing black plugged back into the discussion groteschele was now classifying various types of possible machine errors accidental war caused by some machine failure miscalculation by the computers misinterpretation by the staff of human interpreters the overriders as the computer boys call them and then the big one electronic failure big black thought because no one knows anything about it we just know that in any system so complex and so dependent upon intricate electronic equipment the possibility of electronic failure or error must always be borne in mind but the positive control fail safe system is the ultimate protection against mechanical failure this was the ultimate safety factor in the whole system this was where it all rested so we were all reassured and indeed groteschele was very reassuring today except that his nervous chuckle kept getting in the way black understood why groteschele knew more than he was saying it just was not that simple everyone knew it who had anything to do with the black boxes of the positive control system their components were per cent double checked on regular rotation schedules every possible condition to which the equipment might be subjected in operation was simulated it was simulated in actual duplication systems and it was also simulated on computers with meticulously devised mathematical formulas expressing every possible way the equipment might fail on computers the bombers were flown and the go signals were given variable atmospheric conditions could be predicted operational deterioration of the equipment could be estimated vibration characteristics of the vindicator bombers could be factored in stress variables could be translated into mathematical formulas and with these but the whole system had one big flaw in it nobody could ever be certain that the black boxes would actually work properly in a showdown the reason was simple there had fail safe never been a showdown and there could never be a sure test showdown a showdown meant war the whole positive control system really depended on equipment that could never really be tested until the time came for its first use and because of this nobody could ever really know in advance whether or not it would work right the fail safe machines could be truly tested only once the single time they were used there was ample evidence from the experience of the electra planes and the now obsolete dc s that a serious flaw in an elaborate machine could survive every experimental situation and then in real practice come completely unstuck this was material for the grim inside humor which went the rounds of sac gossip the dc had been a beautiful drawing board plane except that the first ones to go into service caught fire in flight had nt calculated was what flight wind currents would do to fuel overflow spillage the fuel was deflected by an invisible band of air to a point directly behind the engines where the air intake vents sucked in the gas spillage converting the plane s storage compartment into a quite unplanned fire chamber great corporations can also be injured when their computerized positive control systems break down black remembered the consternation a few years back when fortune had demonstrated this point about general dynamics the convair was a million dollar demonstration of the fallibility of computerized simulation convair designed a drawing board airplane that checked out to be the fastest commercial jet in the computer flight tests so they decided to save money skip the costly prototype stage and go directly into production only the did nt perform as designed nobody knew why and the enigmatic computers that had been so reassuring could not be charged with malfeasance the briefing general black also knew that groteschele was sliding past another important factor each machine had to be adjusted their training suffered from fatigue and boredom many was the time that general black had seen a tired and irritated mechanic turn a screwdriver a half turn too far fail to make one last check ignore a negative reading on a testing instrument on a plane such errors would mean only that an expensive piece of machinery and a few men would be lost on a fail safe black box and the men who adjusted and installed them had not the remotest notion of what they were the slightest accident could trigger the final disaster black glanced around the table stark was watching the strategy board new blips had just appeared and stark was toying
nightgown by six o clock the sun had been high enough to make the heat shimmer in the air again looking to the east and squinting to block out the sun she could make out the sierra nevada swimming clear on the horizon she wanted to go somewhere but did not know where there was a glass of beer on the table left from the night before and she flicked a small colorless spider from the rim with her fingernail and let the warm flat beer trickle down her throat that there was really nowhere to go she did not like the mountains and had only a week before come home from the coast made her no less restless lying almost motionless in the still morning heat and chewing absently on the sash to her nightgown she her grades had arrived from berkeley yesterday neatly and irrevocably recorded on the self addressed postcards she had left in her bluebooks one b minus in english b pa c in history a a c in psychology b a c minus in geology commonly known as a football players course in which it was impossible to get below a b and a d in french because the single b was in a three unit course and the d in a four unit course she supposed that she was down grade points and therefore on probation had the postcards arrived at school she would have been embarrassed here it did not seem to matter as her mother had observed she had read some interesting books and gone to some nice parties once she was home that was about the sum of berkeley she did not want to go back anyway she could read books at home she could have a better time at parties at home it was not that to the parties which were the parties to go to she had on a campus where healthy color and easy smiles were commonplace her fragile pallor her uncertainty had attracted a good deal of attention and speculation only when the boys who asked her out discovered how real the uncertainty was did they begin bewildered and bored to lose interest as one of them told lily s roommate who reprovingly told lily taking out lily knight was like dating a deaf mute you have to kid around with them be more fun the roommate advised be yourself although these admonitions seemed to lily in some sense contradictory she tried the next weekend to be more like the girls who were considered fun out with a sigma chi who had just been accepted at princeton theological seminary she had attempted some banter about reinhold niebuhr when that failed she admired the way he played the ukelele after several drinks he although she neither understood them nor thought he should be telling them to her she laughed appreciatively when he asked if she would like to drive up in the berkeley hills shep smiled with delight and said it sounded like fun later she reflected that it had not been entirely his fault that he had misinterpreted her behavior that evening which had ended in front of an all night drugstore on shattuck avenue where the prospective theologian told lily he could get some rubbers rubbers she had said and he had looked at her safes contraceptives she had begun shaking her head then unable to think what to say and he sobered had driven her in silence up the hill to the pi phi house after that she had refused all invitations for three weeks during the spring semester she had gone out briefly with a graduate student who read for her psychology class a jewish boy from new york city named leonard sachs he had the people lily knew they had taken long walks in the hills above the stadium back through strawberry canyon had eaten dinner by candlelight in the small apartment he shared with a friend who did not like lily and made a point of going to the library whenever she was around and had sat on thursday nights in the empty box at the san francisco symphony for which the pi phis paid every year he gave her articles clipped from the new republic outlining the intrinsic immorality of an itinerant labor force hunted up for her an old pamphlet demanding repeal of the california criminal syndicalism law took her to san francisco on the f train to hear a tribute to harry bridges and urged her after he had observed her knitting a sweater for her father to utilize what slender talents she had by teaching handicrafts in a settlement house unable to locate settlement houses in the berkeley yellow pages she finally abandoned that project he referred to the ranch as your father s farm and which he held defective mechanisms and the craven de light he secretly took in luxury merchandise she asked him if he would not miss being home at easter and regarded him in constant and only occasionally unwilling wonder what both aggravated and enthralled him was her total freedom from his personal and social furies and those eumenides at his back were what attracted and repelled lily you re my haunted lover she would laugh although he was literally neither a fact which in his roommate s eyes tended to confirm lily s social uselessness she had even invited him up the river for a day during spring week once home she regretted having asked him but he was delighted by the prospect of observing her in her native decay and so she drove to sacramento to meet him one morning as soon as she saw him standing on the lawn in front of the southern pacific station radiating the same intense concern which had first charmed her in berkeley she knew that alien to the valley as she might have been to the bronx and the alienation went deeper than his black
as a mariner adrift in a night without stars might long for a sextant by saturday night however he had made a makeshift instrument from a week of plumber and electrician estimates he sat in bad light picking bits of a bad supper from his teeth with a toothpick and staring at the black shine of the night backed window moonbloom had become moonbloon and a leg of the remaining n was chipping away would soon become what moonbloor above his brother s name was stolidly permanently still moonbloom he sensed people passing occasionally saw the mirror like window briefly transparent in the light of a passing car mostly though there was just the image of himself cadaverous in the overhead light a sort of grotesque portrait of an executive based by people lived over his office too and what were they like could they all be as horrible and dangerous as his own tenants for a moment he shivered at the thought of the infinitely long list of complaints of all the millions good god he thought what would the advancement that irwin had once promised entail for him longer lists more complicated charts of tormenting complexity it occurred to him that he really did nt want the opportunity irwin had promised or threatened why then was he laboring so mightily to do something because he now seemed to have no choice because he was not like that mariner setting out from a port but rather one adrift in an empty ocean his movement no longer dictated by ambition but by a need to survive somehow he had been cast into the inferno of people at this point it did nt matter whose hand had done the casting pipes ran a hissing came from the he scanned the spread out papers covered with figures and notations and telephone numbers on a clean sheet he accumulated what seemed to be the facts the total cost for what he considered to be the minimal repairs came to five thousand three hundred and eighty seven dollars and twenty two cents the owed rent counting what sheryl beeler had cheated him out of came to a hundred and seventy three fifty irwin expected on or about the first of the year a total of seven weeks rental roughly thirty five hundred out of which he would deposit some five hundred for maintenance this meant that norman would be in the red for approximately he began to laugh caught himself and shivered the mirth to a stop he picked up the pen and tried all over again conscious that he was floating in a stream of lunacy yet unable to stop paddling and was he including what needed to be repaired in the tenants suppose he made a list of those things too tried to find dollars for the hausers for new hearts six hundred and fifty for kram s new body eight hundred and twenty dollars and sixty six cents for refurbish ing basellecci s dignity a thousand for a new dignity for leni cass nine hundred for a retread of ilse s soul five thousand for a brand new one for katz souls must come high he began to laugh again but stopped chilled when it turned to screaming he looked around wildly ready for collapse then he remembered that he had a date with sheryl beeler for that evening and numbed with amazement he was able to collect himself even to the towering fedora and he got up put his coat on with mechanical motions and went to his rendezvous he knocked softly at the door and was almost bowled over by its sudden opening sheryl stood before him in low cut splendor as bright as a poster in a red dress and gleaming lipstick and a silvered jewelry sword pointing toward her just this minute got in come on in and make yourself at home she smelled powerfully of some unnaturally sweet flower and norman partly dazed partly incredulous came blinking out of the dark hallway lemme just slip into something more comfy she said norman could nt believe that she had actually said that and he slumped onto the couch and stared at the depression in beeler s empty chair he heard the water running in the bathroom the feeble sound of the faulty toilet flushing and from another room the sound of snoring very loud and emphatic he wondered whether at this late date he might lose his virginity the thought did nt excite him because there seemed to be nothing that was real about his presence there sheryl came back in the dragon kimono and swished by him to the television set hypnotized he looked past her broad silken back to watch the small square burst open into a scene of a smily band spilling of hot fudge on hollow metal pans music to dance to sheryl said holding her arms out in invitation beyond fear norman went to her grasped the warm resiliency of her torso and began earnestly to do the two step for a few minutes he was able to concentrate on the unfamiliar fact of his dancing he looked down past his arm to the imitation persian rug guiding himself in the pattern that made an invisible checkerboard of the floor one two slide then sideways one two slide the music oozed over him as he navigated the boxes dancing and this step so appropriate for him his dance of life beeler snored the toilet tank drained feebly one two slide one two slide they passed the lamp and sheryl deftly switched it off without breaking the rigid form of his dance one two slide he could barely see the floor which was now lit one two slide one two slide there was a warm trembling against his body as sheryl laughed silently one two slide he emphasized the roots of his hair planted in sweat so that his head felt like a
in all his life had he been so suddenly overwhelmed by the sadness of the afterward when their loving was done chiara had given a small contented sigh buried her face in the pillow and lapsed immediately into sleep it was as if she had left him without warning and without farewell to embark on a private journey as if having touched the limit of love he were left solitary to face the darkness and the terrors of an endless night the terrors were more real than they had ever been before for so rich a pleasuring sometime somehow a price must be paid and he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that he would be the one to pay it what he had felt this night was a springtime flowering which might never repeat itself because for him it was late summer late harvest with the taxman waiting at the gate to claim his due for chiara life was still her debtor payment had been deferred too long and her a man on the wrong side of forty the case was far other he knew where the price tags were hidden he knew the needs that followed the brisk satisfaction of the act of union the need of continuity the need of children to be born of the seed so richly spent in lust or love the need of quiet harbor and a morning sunlight after the storms of the night even as he thought about it chiara stirred and turned toward him for warmth it was a gesture made in a dream but it was more eloquent than words until her marriage to calitri she had been protected at every step by rich and doting parents by cosseting nuns by the traditions of her class when her marriage had failed she had found another refuge and now she had come to rest in his arms to forgetfulness in his practiced embrace so long as he held her strongly and securely she would stay but the moment his grip slackened or his thing was that she saw nothing one sided in the bargain she had given him her body she had given him her reputation what else was there to demand had he told her she would never have understood married and the mother of children she would grow in the end to maturity but in this halfway state she would always be the girl woman half delighted by the adventure half afraid of its consequences but never wholly understanding that the debt of love was not all paid in the coinage of the flesh for her even tonight s encounter rich ruinous and wonderful was a kind of flight and he was too old too wise or too calculating to make it with her instinctively he turned threw his arms about her and drew her to him wondering even as he did so why the miraculous oneness of the flesh should last so short a time and why in the end two lovers must lie so often and so long like across his body her hair brushed his lips her perfume surrounded him but sleep would not come and he rehearsed over and over again their dinner table talk when he had told her of campeggio s advice and where it might lead the pair of them she had listened attentively chin cupped in her hands her dark eyes bright with eagerness intrigued by the prospect of a plot of course darling it s so simple why did nt we think of it before there must be twenty people in rome who d be happy to give evidence against corrado all we ve got to do is find them do you know any of them chiara not really corrado was always fairly discreet with me still i m sure if we talked around we d get a whole list of names the one thing we must nt do he told her firmly is talk around if word finished do nt you understand this is a conspiracy george darling do nt be so melodramatic all we re trying to do is get justice for me you could nt call that conspiracy surely it wears the color of it and in the eyes of the church and civil law it comes to the same thing there are only two things we can do employ a professional investigator or i ll have to do the investigation myself if we use an investigator it will cost me more money than i can afford and in the end he could sell me out to your husband if i do the job myself i m immediately embroiled up to the neck she stared at him wide eyed and innocent are you afraid george yes i am of my husband of his influence yes do nt you want to do but once we re married we have to live if i lose my reputation in rome i ca nt work here any longer we d have to go back to america i would nt mind that besides what about my reputation i did nt throw that in your face did i please chiara please try to understand this is nt a matter of morals it s a matter of authority professional status the credit i live by if i m held up as a common blackmailer where do i start again this is the double standard sweetheart you can sleep around as much as you like you can make a million by exploiting the poor but if you pass a bad check for ten dollars or breach the code of professional ethics you re dead and buried and there s no coming back that s the way the world is rough as guts do what you trip god help you that s what we have to face together if i m not afraid george why should you be i ve got to be sure
was at stebbings and fanny met in the drawing room for a drink before dinner that always irked the children they had an aloof disapproval but darrell liked to sit with a whiskey and soda or a gin telling fanny about the day or his last journey and i liked it too said fanny it was adult a change from those very children then they had dinner which gwyneth used to dish up for fanny after which they waited on themselves it was a three course dinner the table properly laid with all the panoply said to hugh and the children were not allowed to leave the table for their private ploys no matter what these were probably good for them said fanny but again it was irksome philippa chafed while some boy who had called for her sounded his horn outside you can ask him to come in and have some coffee said darrell he does nt want coffee have been sitting here an hour hugh had once burst out a whole hour or an hour and three quarters since you started drinking and there is an important concert i need to hear but darrell had forgotten what it felt like to be young to be passionate about things thought fanny can jazz be so important he had asked quite kindly but it was almost with hate that hugh said this is classical jazz the girls washed up or when they were not home fanny washed the silver and glass the rest waited until the morning she brought coffee into the drawing room darrell read the paper or watched television while fanny watched too or wrote letters or mended at ten o clock they went tamely to bed usually to read thought fanny each putting out their own light with a kiss usually on the cheek or forehead only now and then something warmer again not passionate in the world but that october night darrell did not settle down with the paper did not switch on a programme he came over to her and touched her hair you re looking very well tonight fanny the same as usual fanny tried to speak lightly presently she got up and moved to the other side of the fireplace why go over there i o it s too hot you feel beautifully cool and he asked is nt it time for bed it s only a quarter past nine never mind why not go when we want to you go i have things to do not now yes i have to fanny got up not now said darrell he got up too damn it all i have been away for weeks he put his arm say fanny if we went away just you and i for a few days mother says you ought to have a change and i think we deserve it this job is brutish you have been alone too long we could go up to town do some shows or what about madeira asked darrell no said fanny no but she could not get the words out he bent his head to kiss her again she tried not to shrink but she shrank he held her firmly closer darrell please do nt why what s the matter this thought fanny to herself is where you use control other women but it was no use thinking of other women he was holding her closer still and before she could stop herself she had cried out darrell please do nt touch me do nt touch you the again to control herself this was not darrell s fault and she did not want him to be hurt any more than danny she thought and caught herself back but there was something as simple and noble as an animal about darrell not touch you i m your hus band she tried to be still but when that possessive hold tightened the panic came up again i ca nt now the struggling was growing frantic i ca nt perhaps never again what is all this he was still holding her but now not in his arms holding her with his hands as he felt her struggling fanny you are not afraid i m your husband your husband then help me now fanny was clinging to him help me help you why how just leave me for a little while leave me alone leave me then it may be all right what may be all right what s wrong do nt watch me like that do nt probe this is all nerves said darrell it s not nerves darrell perhaps i should tell you but he was too sure of himself to listen he was not angry he still had not grasped what she was trying though frantically to tell him this is where dearest he said you have to let the man know best it s only that somehow in the last few months we have lost one another a little come somehow to be almost strangers so he had noticed thought fanny it will be all right in a little while said darrell no no cried fanny but he turned her gently towards the door and into the hall i knew then that i could nt said fanny i had made love with rob yes that is what i had made something binding unforgettable and private is not a big enough word a keep between two people made of minutes that last a lifetime until death perhaps past death and for anyone else to touch me was desecration it was hot under the lavender sunshade but again fanny felt cold darrell had steered her to the stairs and stood in the hall watching her go up then she heard him shutting up the house in the bedroom she stayed still listening and as cold as this thought fanny her arms goose fleshed but my head and my temples felt as if they were

valuable trick of looking a person straight in the eyes until those eyes fell kara storm s eyes revealed there in the brightly lighted boathouse were a pale violet intense incredible his were the first to fall she gave a little laugh and turned taking philip s arm and leading the way outdoors the scene as he relived it now was etched indelibly on his brain should he have known that this was no washington society matron but a plotter direct from the house of borgia no he did not think that even john arkwright would have scolded him for misinterpreting her and surely in his habitual ivory tower he could not be expected to know that however corny this type might seem in a cloak and dagger mystery here in real life the communists would necessarily resort to it we americans would be impressed by nothing else captive as we are to television and who should know this better than our enemies he had never seen anyone like her in his narrow world from the top of her sleek head to her remarkably small feet red toenails in sandals in october she was a new phenomenon to him he thought of miss burton and wished that he had her by him to tell him what to do as if she herself would have known the storms led him up a winding path to what philip humorously announced as the camp the grounds were ablaze with lights nestled comfortably among a stand of pines and spruce the building reminded sam of the luxurious hunting lodges he had heard that new york financiers maintained in the adirondacks it was long and rangy with a studied roughness of exterior and sat in grounds beautifully kept in their casualness this was he supposed an expression of kara s personality he felt that storm himself would not have bothered rafted living room straight out of an architectural magazine there were wicker lounging chairs everywhere expensive rugs cushions strewn about the floor in oriental fashion a massive fireplace of imported pink limestone blocks was topped by a huge monolith of some smooth dark rock into the face of which a single ceramic tile had been cemented blazoned with a coat of arms of yellow and blue there was an ineffable sense of expensive repose here these were aristocrats of the old world the room insisted who fled occasionally to the maine wilderness to rest from their exploits charles remained by the door obediently holding sam s bag there seemed no doubt that as far as mrs storm was concerned he was a menial you would like to freshen up i think dr bowden she told sam crisply and led the way to a bedroom at the end of a long paneled hall it was an apartment as sumptuous as the rest of the house complete the bag and followed his mistress out sam wondered as he opened the bag if he had brought the wrong clothes from the inn he had had no idea that he was in for a social week he changed into the best he had a pair of reasonably well pressed slacks and a clean shirt and sallied forth on his return to the living room he realized that he need not have been so careful storm had donned an enormous pair of dirty green cotton pants and a turtle neck sweater kara still immaculate stood out in sharp contrast to him sam felt an invisible barrier between the two to his surprise charles joined them correct and military in his handsome pilot s uniform he was not a servant then after all as they stood chatting for a moment before the crackling fire two siamese cats marched solemnly into the room they came with the air of a royal guard the larger and plainer slightly behind the other sam them in admiration this was in deed a day of surprises the cats ignored him and came to a halt before their mistress sat and stared up at her unblinkingly darlings she cried thank you she turned to sam the kittens are announcing dinner she explained the cats reversed themselves and proceeded slowly toward the dining room she stood looking at the scientist expectantly just barely remembering what to do he offered his arm and they followed the cats in at the entrance kara disengaged her hand and clapped sharply nikita fey off to your reward the two animals still in perfect formation made an oblique turn and marched away without a backward glance it was an exhibition as unexplainable to him as she was herself do nt you think they are well trained dr bowden she smiled and he realized that the whole thing had been an expression of her own superior personality many intelligent creatures can be conditioned to execute orders she went on even to the death if one has the power to command them a remark he thought afterward oddly suggestive of what was to come the dinner competently served by a stolid foreign woman who was wordless went off smoothly and sam as much as possible let the others do the talking storm and charles did most of it recounting the details of their meeting at keezar lake by the end of the meal which he did nt really want sam had begun to entertain a disquieting thought mrs storm must have known that he was going to be there but he carefully said nothing of this thinking that he must have misinterpreted them he was glad when dinner was over and he was permitted to turn in we ll want to get an early start on the lake his host explained and his hostess bid him a cordial good night on end they sailed he and storm the wind held in the north west and the viking outdistanced him on every pass beating him in every race unmercifully the more the icelander won the more
carl s last class was at three good i ll arrange an appointment for three thirty he wrote the time on a pad then carefully arranged the pencil on top of the pad he was silent for a long time carl broke the silence i shall not be able to register for my last year sir without a tuition and textbook loan tell me do you sir you were married in the state i take it your child will be born in the state of course and i ll cast my first vote in this state i ll be twenty one the latter part of next month good i believe you qualify as a state resident this is a state university i like to believe we take care of our own tuition fees are lower for state residents and i am certain a loan can be arranged three per cent interest and ten years to pay carl s sudden relief made him almost incoherent in thanking the dean he thanked him for putting him on his list for the cottage the doctor the loan for annie s class the dean frowned and raised his hand in a stop signal i m told he said that annie is a great asset to the class in playwriting i hope she will be able to said carl i am pleased to know that too bad she can not forge ahead she seems to have so many potentialities for he left the sentence unfinished good luck carl he said abruptly he picked up the telephone carl was dismissed carl chain smoked in the waiting room while dr marson gave annie the preliminary examination lungs heart blood pressure reflexes and so on when he had finished the nurse took annie into a cool cubicle had her undress and helped her onto the table she draped a sheet over annie s nakedness told her to relax and left saying the doctor would see her in a few minutes annie had never had a complete physical examination in fact she had never been to a doctor except for something trivial a cinder in her eye a wart to be removed a vaccination and other minor things she had never been examined while naked she was followed by the nurse now mrs brown he said cheerfully let s see you slide down to the bottom of the table with your knees raised that s it all the way now that s good now put your feet in the stirrups annie did nt know where the stirrups were or what they were for that matter the nurse guided her feet into the stirrups suddenly the doctor threw back the sheet and spread her legs wide apart no annie cried out no do nt she put her legs together and slid back up the table clutching the sheet about her now mrs brown now said the doctor soothingly maybe she ll be more relaxed with her husband here said the nurse i ll get him do nt get him please said annie she did not want carl to see her the doctor says she assumed the position that s a good girl said the doctor the nurse handed him an instrument annie flinched at the first impact of the cold instrument on her inner flesh i know it s a position of great indignity said the doctor but it s necessary indignity it was a new word to annie it sounds exactly like what it means thought annie soon it was over and the doctor left the nurse helped her off the table there that was nt too bad now was it said the nurse no lied annie doctor wants to see you and your husband in his office when you ve finished dressing carl was waiting for her in the corridor mutely she took his hand and held it tight as they went into the office your wife is in her third month of pregnancy said the doctor cheerfully nothing to worry about there annie was alerted at the word there of course she has a very narrow pelvis annie felt a quiver of fear but i do nt think that will give us too much trouble he gave instructions check with the dentist lots of milk for calcium that the baby takes away from a mother do everything she was accustomed to doing but at the first sign of exhaustion lie down and rest diet as usual but avoid fattening foods we want a small baby he said again annie felt that quiver of fear carl asked his fee my fee mr brown fifty dollars the doctor saw annie and carl exchange looks but do nt worry about it pay as we go along or take a year i can wait how much for the hospital asked carl private a gasping sound however i prefer my patients to go to the university hospital that ten dollars a day too asked annie no charge except for anesthetics special diets carl and annie beamed at each other provided he continued provided you permit two of my graduate students interns to observe the birth process from beginning to end perhaps to assist i do nt want any student to experiment on my wife said carl quickly no no i ll deliver the baby the boys may help out in routine things checking during preliminary labor pulse so on annie said carl indicating that the decision was hers to make ten dollars a day she figured ten days a hundred dollars where would we get the money she thought i guess i would nt mind carl she the doctor you re sure annie asked carl i m sure i trust dr marson because the dean recommended him the doctor put his hand over annie s ah thank you mrs brown i d feel more at home though doctor if you d call me annie annie it is then he said i ll
my own wrist watch was stopped i had forgotten to wind it it must have been about four o clock since it was still early spring dawn was fairly late some of the farmhouses i passed had lights in them if the house was very close to the road i could catch a whiff of frying through the small crack of my open window then those houses ended and the road swung directly south through empty lumbering country there was no traffic no house lights there was nt anything except a stretch of concrete and stands of timber there was just a black pre dawn sky and two jabs of my headlights the friendly glow of the dashboard and the vibration of the heavy engine straining slightly as i climbed hills without lessening speed i ve always liked to drive alone at night there is a sentimental brightness to things it s a good deal like being drunk i always see the world perfectly then see it in all its great pathetic clarity i become invincible beyond life and death with the hum of wheels under me i can love the human race as i never can at any otherptime i can think great cloudy thoughts and tremble with the power have a dozen children and live forever it seems possible i drove very fast i knew as everyone else did that the highway patrols went home at three and did nt come back until seven i was making very good time the grades got steeper and i had to push a little on the accelerator to maintain speed i was crossing the ridge of hills that separated the great central valley from the smaller providence valley the providence river was the one you saw from the front of our house the one that the first william howland had followed when he was looking for a place to settle the one he had named for his mother i did nt believe i could have gotten here so fast i slowed and opened the window and looked out pine trees neat rows neat fences then a lumber road i slowed even more and read the small identifying sign it was the eastman halsey tract i was three quarters of the way home i closed had come i really should have looked at the speedometer john would be furious if he ever found out but i did nt slow down i came out of the mountain ridges and zoomed down the straight level road through madison city the courthouse street lights burning at each of its four corners post office street lights broken in front of it john s office shuttered and empty and how does the roll top desk look in there teetering on its too thin legs in the dark i startled a pack of dogs rooting in the garbage pails in front of the happy chicken cafe they bolted for the shadows yelping i passed joe s place on the outskirts of town closed and dark except for the string of small lights burning in its parking lot just then the radio went off very suddenly without static without any warning its sound stopped the lights still burned and i pushed all the buttons and worked the a new car and it was very annoying i do not like to drive alone without a radio what had been fun turns into something mildly threatening the dark which had been filled with the pleasant empty headed chatter of the machine closed back and this time it was filled with its own sounds not with yours the sounds of empty country and empty roads depressing a little frightening i was happy that i was almost home and that dawn was almost breaking the sky was already lightening you could see that the day would be overcast at least until the ground fog rose and burned away i came to the bend at thatcher s creek and slowed down no more than a mile now i should see the house at the next turn the sky was silvery colored fish colored the color of a swamp cat the wild azaleas were blooming i had nt realized how many of them there were their sweet wet perfume slipped through the crack of wet i felt the wheels skid once slightly i slowed down still more this valley often had fogs when the higher drier mountains had none the road curved up to our pastures edged by a barbed wire fence covered with tight pink sweetheart roses not yet in bloom and then i came to the last turn and looked up the slope of ground toward the house somehow i had gotten the idea that it would not be there would have disappeared like a ghost damn that radio i thought but of course it was there vague and indistinct in the fog but there just the way it had been for the last five generations it looked very very large in this light and empty fog covered the fields beneath it so that it seemed to float without solid ground just exactly like those fairy castles in a child s story book i turned in the drive through the great mass of azaleas john had planted these were nt quite in bloom their wet leaves shone black in the fog i drove faster the gravel rattling off my tires until i came to the end and there was the yard familiar and safe stretching in front of me full of known things a power mower forgotten and left out overnight a rake leaning against the house a bicycle empty clothes lines cords frayed and fluttering pat that moment the radio went on again very loud i listened for a minute then switched it off as i walked to the kitchen door pulling the key from my purse shivering a little in the morning chill i began to wonder and the more i thought the

pins and matches and belts and shoelaces and dirty looks will ellis beat the naked witness in a locked seclusion room deborah slid down the wall to an accustomed place on the floor among the other statues watching the pictures in her mind simple pictures explicit and terrifying in the evening lucia a new patient with a certain prestige for her violence and the nine years she had spent in one of the roughest hospitals in the country suddenly said to the small group of perpetually cold ones who were huddled around the radiator enclosure it s different here i been lotsa lotsa wards what s here there s more scared more mad pissin on the floor and yellin but it s because of the maybe it s because of the little little maybe she went off again leaping in her long ostrich run down the hall laughing in order to negate the immense fearful power of her words but they had been given and they were hanging in the air like the zoo smell of the ward itself everyone was afraid of the hope the little little maybe but for deborah coming at that moment the words had a special ring so that she looked out into both worlds and saw the imminent things the lowering cloud and the worms that were dropping from it and the law blowing like a shred in the black wind never mind the maybe it s an administrative problem pesther and jacob sat together in the office waiting dr fried saw for reassurance that she was not god there were no sure promises and she could not be a judge of what they had done or not done to their daughter to bring her to this battlefield is it wrong to want a child like anyone else s jacob asked i i mean is there a cure really or will she stay here and have to be placated and comforted always he heard how cold his words sounded it is nt a question of love sick or well it s only that we have to expect something even to hope for something can you tell us what we may hope for if you want to hope for a college diploma and a box of dance invitations and pressed roses and a nice clean cut young man from a fine family i do nt know this is what most parents hope for i do nt know if deborah will have these things someday or if she will even find out and come to terms with what she really does want may we see her dr fried had known that the question would come and here it was it was the one she did nt want to answer of course if you decide to see her you may but i would not advise it this time she tried to make the answer very very calm why not jacob said moving loudly against his fear because her feeling of reality is quite shaky now the way she looks might alarm you a little and she knows this and is afraid for you and for herself also jacob sat back dazedly wondering why they had ever done this thing the old deborah as she was might have been sick as they all said she had been unsure and wretched but she had been theirs unsure to be guarded and planned for wretched to be cheered and the picture that this doctor made was of someone unrecognizable let me say that the symptoms are not the sickness the doctor was saying these symptoms are defenses and shields believe it or not her sickness is the only solid ground she has she and i are hacking away at that ground on which she stands that there will be another firmer ground for her after this is destroyed she can only take on faith imagine it for yourself for a moment and you can see why she does nt pay attention to her grooming why she gets so frightened and the symptoms proliferate dr fried tried to describe the feelings of someone who had never known real mental health in her life we who have never experienced this sickness firsthand can only guess what horror and loneliness there must be you know she is now being called upon to suspend all the years of what she has known as reality and to take another version of the world on faith health the world we gave her was nt so horrible jacob said but she never took your world at all do nt you see she created a robot that went through the motions of reality and behind it the true person drew further and further away knowing that people feared the unknown person behind the familiar robot she let the matter rest jacob said quietly i still want to see her no jacob it s better es i want to see her it s my right very well the doctor said affably i ll call and have her brought down from the ward and you may see her in the visitors room she went to her phone if you should want to see me again afterward please have the attendant on duty call me i will be here until four she watched them leave and walk rigidly toward they say make her well they say with good table manners and a future according to our agreed on dream she sighed even the intelligent the honest the good find it too easy to sell their children deceits and vanities and arrogances that they would never stoop to for themselves they perpetrate on their children ach another sigh escaped from her because she had never given birth or nursed a child and because she wondered suddenly if she too would not connive or be ambitious buy dreams and wish them impossibly on a deborah if the deborah were her own she thought
come on he roared let s go motioning for the chubby luther to perform the painful role of the girl candy now sidney maybe we d better not get started again luther observed apprehensively you know the doctor just told you to take it easy come on uncle jack bellowed and whether he was furious simply part of the dance he stalked up to his brother inlaw and slapped him smartly in the face this was too much for ida who finally passed to the attack and began pushing uncle jack vigorously toward his bed hands off he shouted in astonished protest hands off you sow i ca nt stand another minute of this candy thought good grief and she rushed blindly out of the room to find help she flew down the hall and with a little sob of despair flung open the first door she came to but was startled to find herself again in the service room full of mops and buckets where she d made the acquaintance of irving krankeit s mother it seemed impossible she could have sworn that the tiny room was whole floors and corridors distant tucked away in some obscure corner of the colossal building had nt it taken her ten minutes to find her way back from it to daddy s room of detergent yes there was the little sliding panel it was still partially open and as she looked she heard someone in the amphitheater say something that sounded like ping candy had an almost physical premonition warning her not to look but some still louder inner force candy fiercely compelled her to peer into the vastness below chiang aunt livia naked unconscious attached by the wrists to the vertical operating table looked like a handsome animal offered for sacrifice seated immediately behind her was krankeit the young doctor sat silently as if meditating on the form before him then he took something from a table at his side leaned forward and inserted it in livia s girlish right buttock moo he said distinctly settling back into his seat this was krankeit s ancient chinese therapy candy thought with a tinge of reverence these were the chinese pins with which he had treated her that he was now sticking in livia candy suddenly felt very tired and beyond the fatigue was an aching uneasiness which was nt due solely to her resentment at seeing livia occupy her place on the tilting table i feel as if something were coming to an end she thought my childhood perhaps tch ou krankeit said and sat back in a minute though he was forward again with another pin back and forth he went like someone giving artificial respiration very slowly and the pins grew into clusters like two little bouquets one on each of livia s handsome tushy moung how defenseless aunt livia looked strapped to the table naked and unconscious and a few hours ago it had been her of course krankeit was a doctor candy reflected but he was also a man and livia was beautiful it seemed so unfair somehow and things and rush into the amphitheater ping oh i just wish that it would stop happening she thought cross and weary i just wish i were someplace else meeow there was a note of tense excitement in krankeit s voice now which grew stronger with each pin someplace far from racine i m tired of that darn old college too fu krankeit cried feng jao putting in three pins in quick succession i do nt care candy said to herself i do nt want to see aunt livia anymore or dr krankeit either wowee one of krankeit s hands candy noticed was briskly engaged in his lap why why he s abusing himself she thought her eyebrows shooting up at that precise moment she thought of new york city and decided to go there yelled someplace where she knew no one and where no one knew her pow fang dang pow krankeit screamed triumphantly dropping forward from his chair to lie utterly spent face down and apparently unconscious on the floor of the great amphitheater where she could lose the old candy in the nameless city streets she thought where she could finally be herself there was only one tree on grove street this was the sort of thing candy was quick to notice and to love look she would say softly squeezing someone s hand is nt it too much i could just hug myself every time i pass it and that was where she met the hunchback it was late one airless summer day when the sky over greenwich village was the color of lead it had just begun to rain and candy was standing back in a shallow doorway waiting for her bus dreamily joyful in her new mandarin rain cloak hugging it to her she saw him he was out in the midst of the downpour leaning against the tree staring into the window display of the men s shop on the corner he was standing very still though from time to time there seemed to be a slight movement of his back as if he might be consciously pressing his hump against the tree candy s humming softened as she watched him and her heart beat a little faster oh the fullness of it she thought the terrible beautiful fullness of life and a great mass of feeling rose in her throat at the pity she felt for her father so shut away from it all never to know life never even to suspect what it was all about she put her arms around her delightful body and hugged herself so glad at being alive really alive and her eyes brimmed with shimmering gratitude just then two boys passed the corner of the rain one of them noticed the hunchback and gave a derisive snort wha cha doin mac gittin yer nuts off he

that uncle nate recruited from this area he says me i could have found him plenty jewish candidates the jailers are bad birds this is true but it has nothing to do with their religion there s more on the list nick rubin s band of bulldogs who back up the jailers every move then dobrilubov the cossack cook who is also the shop teacher and pebbleby the janitor a walking scarecrow and on the bottom of the list you will find rosencrantz the chauffeur rabbi whose box is the narrowest of all but there is still something on bottom of the bottom the boys uncle nate keeps them ten in a box the boys are too numerous to list but i ll give you a sample matches who burned his mother alive an accident of course and bullets bucharevsky who is a specialist in tortures he likes to carve his initials on other people s chests lovely boys but i prefer them all even bullets to uncle nate am and you will soon be in the same position but enough i ll leave the briefing to uncle nate i m sure he ll have a few surprises for you rosencrantz halted the car near a wooden fence witha number of missing ties we ll have to walk from here nick nathanson does nt like me to keep the car inside his property i always leave it near the road we stepped out of the car rosencrantz offering to carry my grip i thanked him and told him that it was very light and that i could manage it he saw me staring at the fence nick he said the fence is nothing it s no more than a marker he pointed to the kennels that were placed in strategic positions all along the fence the kennels had white washed walls and neatly shingled roofs there is uncle nate s protection a bulldog with an enormous snout lounged inside the kennel nearest rubin s general the lead dog i could ram the car into the fence and it would nt make any difference to him he never growls when i m around he knows i m harmless if you came alone nick he would have you pinned on the ground by now with half your head in his jaws an intruder would not get very far here believe me but as soon as he sees you re with me then shadrach will have nothing to do with you we both scrambled under the fence there were several sheds behind the kennels most of them had makeshift roofs and their chimneys generally sagged each shed had only one window the barracks rosencrantz said the boys live there uncle nate is trying to simulate a military arrangement so he has his own little army and the boys do nt mind they enjoy drilling with wooden rifles we walked past the kennels and the sheds the home of the general staff rosencrantz said mockingly they say it used to be one of harriman s estates but i think that s just a rumor that uncle nate himself has propagated he enjoys creating his own histories folklore is his favorite subject if you listen to him the jews invented the world and will have a hand in destroying it he is a great believer in all sorts of messianic claptrap every time he hears the thunder crackle he convinces himself that his deliverer will come and free him and the home and all the jews throughout the world and the president too he would nt want to have a world without roosevelt he pointed to one of the gables nick you see that window with the boards over it that s where nathanson keeps his little dungeon if you re a nuisance you get a warning and then maybe one of the jailers works you over but with a major offense you get three to tell you about the dungeon bullets is in there now uncle nate gave him the maximum we heard a repeated thud coming from the cellar of the house i stopped and tried to peek through one of the tiny cellar windows but the glass was backed with wire and all i could make out was a few gray forms then i heard a prolonged shout ahhhiii god i said stepping back rosencrantz gripped my arm it s nothing he said the boys are drilling in the gym murdock is teaching them some japanese bayonet charges he used to be a marine a man came out of the house and stood on the porch he had a short thin body and an unusually large head he was wearing a black skullcap rosencrantz turned towards him and dipped his cap knowingly shalom rubin shalom his shoulders drew together under his black coat rabbi you now nick rosencrantz said shaking my hand his palm felt moist we ll talk later goodbye he boarded the porchand opened the screened door he was at least two headstaller than rubin later nick he said again and ducking his head he disappeared behind the screen rubin walked towards the edge of the porch he was wearing thick soled work shoes he placed both thumbs in his mouth and whistled i noticed a stir in one of the kennels then the bulldog that we had seen before bounded past the row of sheds leaving a ragged curtain of dust behind him and before i had the chance to turn around the dog was already on the porch nuzzling rubin s knee with his armor plated head salute nick rubin commanded him come on shad shadrach raised one forepaw grudgingly come on up rubin said smiling i was a little alarmed his smile back did the rabbi give you his usual spiel he asked me but there was no indication of a threat in his voice we ought to hire him as a guide i shifted the grip
there all day now her last breath was near her children from the soft pallet lest contrary to christian custom she should die upon a feather bed i had given them a thread out of the martyr s robe to place beneath her tongue and they had done so although serena was steadfast in saying only thy will be done instead of praying that her life be spared now she lay dying on the cold stone with her children all about her and the young roger holding a cross for her to see benedict hoped that still the saint might intervene serena was a woman of pure faith he crossed the line of pilgrims and made his way to her william sat staring after him his sheepish grin fading to a look of contemplation he knew the worth of the monk s argument that formal recognition of the miracles was slow in coming and that as yet no dignitary of the land had followed in the footsteps of the poor to canterbury he knew that the de brocs still menaced travelers who spoke of miracles and devils in the pilgrims so that they might cast them out indeed at easter time after the crypt had first been opened to the populace ranulf de broc himself had come to prior odo and drawn his sword and threatened that he would carry off the body from the church that night the monks in secret took the corpse out of its sepulcher and hid it in the dark behind the altar of the virgin only the next day crippled richard son of einold had discovered it that was a curious miracle william had witnessed it richard was hobbling past the altar where unknown to him the body lay when suddenly he cast away his staff and fell upon his face then rose again fell down again and once again rose up and gathered all his strength and leaped upon the altar agile as a boy when he jumped down it was to stand upon the soles of his two feet like any healthy man william had run to him certain altar why he had fallen there why he had leaped on it and richard answered i was constrained to by the mother of god thus the monks knew they could not hide the body from the world they put it back into its sepulcher and called the masons in to build a strong safeguarding wall around it but for the pilgrims sake they left small apertures through which petitioners might reach their heads to kiss the tomb it was a curious fact fitzstephen noted that some could put their heads through easily indeed a wild man once had climbed right through while others though they were no larger were unable to william thinking these things let his gaze fall on the little desk that benedict used to keep his records on he saw a pile of parchments weighted by the dipper benedict had lain across them when he rose to go william took them up and held them to the light to read they were the robert a smith of thanet cured of a pain muriel of canterbury two years diseased the clerk s quick eyes raced over them curbaran a shoemaker of dover absolutely and incredibly simple enough his eye was caught and held he lifted the parchment above the others and read on simple enough to say the lord s prayer daily for the soul of the martyr not knowing that he who prays for a martyr demeans the martyr was visited in a dream by thomas who directed him to dig in a certain place under a mill and he did so and found a very thick and rusty denarius which he tried with his teeth and found to be gold it was a coin of the emperor diocletian and worth some forty silver pieces william stopped reading and smiled he felt a glow of gratitude at the shoemaker s good fortune simple though he was musing he looked up something more he smiled again as realization struck him gratitude for brother benedict he shifted through the parchments and began to read again mad henry of fordwich dragged by his friends to the tomb all yes he heard the wild commotion on the steps that morning a heavy woman stood in front of william ile looked up to see the matron from the money smithy with her eve fastened upon him and in her hands a little package wrapped in linen cloth william smiled cautiously over the months wulviva had become increasingly persistent in her visits to the tomb the water which had cured her daughter had become quite famous since then the monks had made great quantities themselves and with it cured a wide variety of ills and yet her own son almon remained dumb ever more frequently she came with him or alone bringing small offerings pleading some of the monks had come to think of her as a reproach master william what do you think our thomas water s worked another miracle pride and conspiracy rasped in her voice she knew he liked to be the first to hear such stories and william s face lit as it always lit when he heard promise of exotic news i have a neighbor she confided blind and now sees he came today to beg a drop of our miraculous water and walter gave it to him though he holds it dear for his wife s sake you know that miracle fitzstephen nodded of course he said the monks have writ it down she said with satisfaction but this blind man walter brought the water and he put his finger in and with it wet his eyes and straight away he wiped away the darkness he had come guided but he went home unguided it was a miracle even brother benedict will say it was a miracle silent moment she
boasted of it to his father his father gazed at him and where is the goose his father said i could not reach it the boy said it came so close and then it drifted far away he reeled from the bed and drifted to the window but the figure coming down the street was gone again he had missed some unknown chance the street was void a void avoid dog a vulture nothing more and thus we parted sang lenore singing somewhere somewhere there was singing his whole body shimmered with the chords the fountainhead of music overflowing the chords were multicolored vaulting like rockets across his consciousness he could break off pieces of the music like pieces of meringue you re sleeping your life away he told the dog do you hear me i said do you hear me meri wether sheriff guzman said that s some name for a red nigger ai nt it you re the smart one ai nt you kid ai nt you supposed to be the smart cheyenne done good in the war and now they gone to send they little pet christ lovin cheyenne to college ai

much you come back and see us now alas too late the world is dead you sleepyhead the inn of the dog and the vulture there are voices you see then singing voices then strange musics hollowed out as if drifted through a wind tunnel these followed by a huge void of bleak silence suggesting death the story of my life by lewis moon now something has happened was happening is happening but will not happen do you hear me i said do you hear me a softer tone please to begin at the beginning my name is meriwether lewis moon or is that the end again i was named meriwether lewis moon after meriwether lewis who with lieutenant william clark crossed north america without killing a single indian so said my father my father up on north mountain alvin moon still traps and hunts and in world war i when still a despised non citizen exempt from service joined those other indians as insane as himself who volunteered to serve in world war i alvin moon is half cheyenne he went down south when he came home and took up with a creole choctaw woman named big irma and brought her back up to his mountain the worst mistake that alvin moon ever made was trying to educate himself his information about lewis and clark was the only piece of education he ever obtained and it was wrong he used to joke that he could nt educate himself unless he learned to read and how could he learn to read if he did nt educate himself so he left off hunting and trapping and came down off his mountain and took work near the reservation to keep his children in the mission school to give them a better chance in life i ai nt got nothin said joe redcloud and the hell of it is i broke my back paid out every cent to keep then kids into that school and now they do nt know no thin neither only jesus christ now ai nt that somethin they sit around here thinkin about godamighty i reckon while they re waitin on their gover ment reliefs all but meriwether lewis again my name is lewis moon and i am lying on a bed deathbed in a strange country and i hear eerie voices and a crack is appearing on the wall wider and wider and the bulb in the ceiling is growing more and more bulbous and will surely explode a crack of doom of lightning down the walls the extract of b caapi is a powerful narcotic and hallucinogen containing phenol alkaloids related to those found in lysergic acid and whether or not it finds a respectable place in the pharmaceutica of man it has held for unknown centuries an important place at the time of my experiment i was lying in a narrow room with a corpse in the next bed with god a vulture and a dog as witnesses wishing that marguerite were here marguerite i wish to tell marguerite that the reason i did not make love to her that time in hong kong was not because i did not want her but because i had reason to believe that in the late low hours of the week before i had contracted a low infestation i did not know marguerite well enough to give her crabs you understand marguerite had alabaster skin triumphant hair and an unmuddied soul and a swinging little ass into the bargain you listen to me meriwether lewis what the hell you sass that sheriff for he mighta kilt you you stay clear of whiskey then long as you ca nt stay out of trouble you ai nt welcome back and do nt you show your mam that bad face neither ll whup you again hero or no hero alvin moon joe redcloud said you re all

none of us lessen we do nt get somethin learned here to us pretty quick i have opened my eyes again to shut off all that blue color can threaten overwhelm whirling like that an ant in a kaleidoscope

his father he is perhapspeven more respected in one particular only a kind of scar he carries without pain and without any clear memory of the amputation does the man he is differ from the man he assumed he would become he never prays the man stood up when the woman entered the room or to be exact door she closed the door behind her the room was square and furnished in a strange cool manner midway between a home the pale detailed japanese prints on the wall the thick carpet whose blue seemed a peculiarly intense shade of silence the black slab sofa with its single prism shaped pillow of airfoam and an office which it was though no instruments or books were on view it would have been difficult to imagine the people who could appropriately inhabit this room were they not already here the man and woman both were impeccably groomed the woman wore ar linen suit with white shoes and a white pocketbook her silvery blond hair done up tightly in a french roll she neverpwore a hat today she wore no gloves the man wore a summer suit of a may slightly lighter than the woman s though perhaps it was merely that he stood nearer the light of the window in this window like the square muzzle of a dragon pinched beneath the venetian blinds dimmed the light which since this side of the building faced away from the sun was already refracted the man had a full head of half gray hair rather wavy and scrupulously brushed a touch vainly so that a lock overhung his forehead as if he were a youth the woman had guessed he was about ten years older than she in addition to the possibility of vanity she read into this casually overhanging forelock a suggestion of fatigue it was afternoon he had already listened to so much and an itch to apologize to excuse herself scratched her throat and made her limbs bristle with girlish nervousness he waited to sit down until she had done so and even such a small concession to her sex opened a window in the wall of impersonality between them she peeked through and was struck by the fact that he seemed neither handsome nor ugly she did not know what to make of it or what she was expected heavy and petulant it lifted and innocent expectation seemed to fill it the customary flutter of panic seized her both bare hands squeezed the pocketbook the purring of the air conditioner threatened to drown her first words she felt the lack in the room of the smell of a flower in her own home the sills were crowded with potted plants i saw him only once this week she said at last out of polite habit she waited for a reply then remembered that there was no politeness here and forced herself to go on alone at a party we spoke a little i began the conversation it seemed so unnatural to me that we should nt even speak when i did go up to him he seemed very pleased and talked to me about things like cars and children he asked me what i was doing these days and i told him nothing he would have talked to me longer but i walked nt his voice so much it was his smile when we were seeing each other i used to think that there was a smile only i could bring out in him a big grin whenever he saw me that lit up his whole face and showed all his crooked teeth there it was when i walked up to him that same happy smile as if in all these months nothing had changed she looked at the catch on her purse and decided she had begun badly the man s disapproval was as real to her as the sound of the air conditioner it flowed toward her enveloped her in gray coolness and she wondered if it was wrong of her to feel it wrong of her to desire his approval she tried to lift her face as if she were not flirting in another room she would have known herself to be considered a beautiful woman here beauty ceased to exist and she was disarmed realizing how she wondered if she should try to express this he sees through me she said it s what made him so wonderful then and what makes him so terrible now he knows me i ca nt hide behind my face when he smiles and he seems to be forgiving me forgiving me for not coming to him even though i ca nt the man readjusted himself in the chair with a quickness that she took for a sign of impatience she believed she had an honest gift for saying what he did not want to hear she tried to say something that in its frankness and confusion would please him i m suppressing she said he did say one thing that if he had nt been my lover he would nt have said he looked down at my dress and asked me in this shy voice did you put that on just to hurt me it was so unfair it many dresses and i ca nt throw out all the ones that that i wore when i was seeing him describe the dress when he did speak the level of his interest often seemed to her disappointingly low oh she said an orangey brown one with stripes and a round neckline a summer dress he used to say i looked like a farm girl in it yes he cut her short with a flipping gesture of his hand his occasional rudeness startled her since she could not imagine he had learned it from any book she found herself lately afraid for him he seemed too naive and blunt she felt him
of his clothes by the time the door closed and he tugged jacy toward the bed pulling rudely at her skirt she shrugged loose and went to the window to undress at her own pace if you ca nt wait you can jump out this window she said i do nt think it will work anyway duane was not certain it would either and waited nervously the room was chill and jacy had goose bumps on her breasts as she lay down she looked at duane casually men were certainly strange all she really expected was something tickly but duane surprised her horribly he did nt tickle a bit but instead he did something really painful at first she was too startled to move and then she yelled out loud someone in an adjoining room kicked the wall indignantly quit quit she said it was intolerable duane was much to thrilled to quit but fortunately he did nt take long jacy was got gingerly out of bed meaning to take a hot bath and discovered that the little room did nt even have a bathroom in it just a lavatory there must be one down the hall someplace duane said but she would nt let him go look for it she felt strange and wanted to leave all the way back to the motel she kept glancing over her shoulder expecting to see a trail of blood on the sidewalk behind her duane was walking happily along infuriatingly proud of himself oh quit prising jacy said you need nt think i m going to take you back just because of that i do nt think you did it right anyway sure t did duane said but he was nt really positive and he brooded about it during the remainder of the trip they did it twice more once in the motel in san francisco and once icc flagstaff arizona on the right but for some reason jacy did nt swoon with bliss she only allowed it twice more because she thought bobby sheen would like it if she had a little more experience the whole business was far from delightful but she supposed that was probably because duane was a roughneck in flagstaff it went on much too long and she got exasperated and told him off once and for all you never will learn she said i do nt know why i went with you so long i guess we have to keep on being sweethearts until we get home but that s gon na be the end of it we ll just have to think of something big to break up over duane just could nt understand it he was more dejected and more in love than he ever had been jacy was bending over to slip her small breasts back into their brassiere cups she had never looked more lovely and he could not believe she was serious about breaking up he went over to the motel dressing table and combed her hair thoroughly looking at herself in the mirror and paying absolutely no attention to him the rest of the way home across arizona new mexico texas he tried to think of ways to make her realize that they had to stay together he was sure her disaffection would only be temporary jacy was thinking how glad she would be to get home she had even decided there was no point in making a big production of breaking up she was sick and tired of the seniors as an audience they were not worth bothering about when the bus finally pulled into thalia late one june afternoon she did nt so much as tell duane good bye she was tired and went right over to her parents cadillac while her father got her bags lois was watching her shrewdly i see you got enough of him she said quietly that s that i m just not interested in saying one word lacy said watching them drive away duane felt a little sick at his stomach he realized jacy had meant what she said she was really done with him it was very confusing to him because he had always thought you were supposed to get whoever you really loved that was the way it worked in movies it was all he could do to carry his suitcase to the pickup sonny had merely endured the return trip sitting in the back of the bus watching the desert go by he had paid duane and jacy as little attention as possible and it was not until he and duane got in the pickup in thalia that he noticed his friend was depressed what s the matter he asked surprised nothin duane said sonny knew better well what is it he persisted you feel bad for a moment duane considered telling the truth but then he decided not to i m worn to s hard on a person they were living over the poolhall billy with them though genevieve had kept him while the seniors were gone returning to the poolhall was a little strange particularly since sam the lion was nt there if he had been there they would have shot some pool and had a great time telling him all about the trip it would have picked everyone s spirits up as it was the poolhall was quiet and empty and there was not a great deal to do while the seniors were in california a great scandal rocked thalia all the mothers were agreed that it was the very worst thing that had ever happened in the town john cecil was fired from his teaching job for being a homosexual the scariest thing of all the mothers thought was that it was just by a happenstance that he was found out if it had nt been for coach popper s vigilance and his interest in the welfare of the children nobody would have known innocents
then it happened giovanni bruno lifted his hand mrs norton with a gasp stood rigidly expectant marcella set the coffeepot down slipped over by the bed weak but yet resonant giovanni bruno s voice entered the still room for the first time the coming of light mrs norton drew a quick sharp breath clara stood felt betty and elaine fearful at her side when asked mrs norton there was a long pause giovanni s eyes moved among them returned to stare upon mrs norton sunday he said week he dropped his hand clara started to speak up to ask what this was about but mrs norton held up her hand for silence the coming of light she repeated and giovanni nodded sunday week again he nodded giovanni bruno hear me is there anything is there something more a pause and then he shook his head so the movement made his hair splay out on the pillow and clara was astonished to see how really long it had grown mrs norton relaxed but when she turned from the bed to face them clara saw tension and worry on her face still what is it asked clara though she had already begun to grasp it though frightened she was ready she had been tested she realized and found true i do nt know exactly mrs collins then may i she fingereda small gold medallion that hung around her neck on a chain may i explain something to you clara nodded she sat in awe but feeling ely close at her side once more vince bonali stopped up at the eagles one night for a whiskey keeping nothing at home but beer these lean days from the minute he walked into the place he was reminded of old angelo moroni and from then on had gone to school together hunted women together broken into mining and drunk together were best men at each other s weddings had worked their ways up simultaneously to be facebosses out at number nine and they had always teamed up to play pitch and pinochle ange with his hat tipped down to his nose vince deadpan with a mouthful of cigar unbeatable goddamn combination that was mainly what hit him when he walked in sal ferrero was shooting pool with georgie lucci vince carried his whiskey over sat down on a stool to watch they bandied sober hellos around sal and angie and he used to make a trio ever since sal married ange s sister in recent years sal only worked as a repairmanin the mine and in a different section at that so they d kind of split apart but family functions always saw them together again and he and sal had seen a lot of each other since the disaster sal was a small wiry man knew how to joke around with the best of them always on hand when help was needed he was one of the first guys down into the mine after the explosion told vince later he d mainly gone down to look for him and ange he d found ange okay lucci was one of the four guys in vince s gang who d panicked after the blast and run out without knowing where they were going lucci and his buddy brevnik had lucked out lee cravens and pooch minicucci had gone the wrong way tomorrow vince had to deliver the relief checks to their families happy valentines he did nt look forward to it want in offered sal straightening up he had just muffed a shoo in on the ninespot no thanks said vince i get a bigger charge outa watching the exhibition then keep your eye on this n vincenzo old culo growled georgie down the length of his cue pair of clicks he pocketed both the nine and the fifteen then proceeded to clean the table sal plunked a half dollar on the table while georgie was still lining up the last ball never could do any good on friday the thirteenth he said so it was friday the thirteenth find anything yet asked georgie leaning into his shot not yet vince had found himself caught up in an odd sense of nervous exhilaration the past week or so but it was starting to fade on him what kicked it off was saying out loud what he d wanted to say for thirty years he was through with coalmining he d put in a couple applications around town talked to different people boasted how he was commencing the new life fifty years or no everybody d agreed that yes by god he was doing the right thing took a lot of nerve to try to learn new tricks when you were appreciated that in fact they sometimes harped on it so much vince would get a little jittery just what the hell could he learn to do he d ask himself then just as quickly he d shove the dumb question aside let s see what they ask him to learn first georgie plucked the coin off the felt emptied the far pockets as sal racked i hear guido mello got on at the garage where lem filbert s working he said and chalked his cue yeah that s right vince said he d tried there asked too late awful lot of guys seemed to have the same idea he had vince s kids the two still at home charlie and angie had showed right off they were pleased had talked up the change they made big plans for the future charlie actually getting halfway friendly to him for the first time in the kid s useless life would flash had turned up vince always returned the boy a healthy line give the kid a little ambition by example began to consider taking him fishing when spring came on charlie had never taken an interest like the other boys go upstatefor a couple days maybe sleep out

minute in which to catch the room unawares to see a strange room with a stranger s eyes but this was play acting and slightly pompous not a role blix could maintain for long she closed the door behind her and smiled at me where s the ice cream melted of course i thought that she who never shed a tear because of pain might cry now for lack of what she d counted on there s more i told her lots more a half gallon we can eat all night will you eat too a usual night i do nt intend just to watch you she had cried once from pain i thought in the kitchen stirring the powdered coffee into ice cream i remembered what blix had told me on the evening i had persuaded her that her hand would know when the time came to reach for that plastic container she had cried the afternoon before some fierce pang unaffectedby shots or pills had gripped her she had gotten out of bed and folded herself crying into the position knees and cheek to floor that newborn babies remembering a lost ease take when sleeping she had stayed there without ease unsleeping silently crying when she did get up a tear damp spot large as a puppy s wetting was left to gray the white carpet the next day persuaded that her hand would be knowledgeable she said tassie do you know why i cried yesterday after noon because was hurting but that was nt why i cried i cried because i was happy i was glad to feel the pain get fierce it would help me to want to do what i had to do i did nt know about trusting my hand then i thought i d have to be given a shove and this was the shove i needed the pain did nt make me cry the happiness did i thanked god for the pain blix was still in the living room when i came back from the kitchen with the food she surprised me by saying let s eat in here i put the tray on the coffee table the ice cream was good strong and bittersweet blix i asked do you remember the funny ice cream fad you brought to brenner the summer you stayed with me and everett ice cream fad i remember a lot about brenner that summer but if there was a funny ice cream been anything funny about it at the time not to us involved in it anyway something ludicrous yes but that only added to the misery to know that what you re doing is ludicrous to hate being ludicrous but unable to stop talking to blix all those years later the whole summer was funny too sad for tears the ice cream episode funny as a crutch exactly that funny a story of accidents and cripplings some of the story which started with melon a la mode blix had never heard before i told her partly to make her laugh partly since she was short changed on future to give her more past do nt you remember i asked her that you took cleaned cantaloupes to the tahquitz confectionery that summer and had ice cream put in them no i think you re making it up how could i make up anything like that what i i remember is manuel but your cantaloupe caper was what gave me a chance to be with him so i remember the cantaloupes too this was the first time i had ever stepped out of my role of elder sister to blix admitted i was no example mentioned the name of a man not my husband mentioned manuel s name a kind of sick emptiness filled me as i did so i was saying good by to a part i had played for so long that without it i did nt know who i was no i knew who i was but i did nt know how publicly to be the person i was face to face i knew my own self but i had never let blix face me the craze that blix introduced to brenner that summer was a mild one well suited to a pilgrim campus where it had started there the college kids had taken cleaned cantaloupe halves to the local ice cream parlor and enjoyed cantaloupe patch of small but flavorsome melons out beyond the chicken houses blix cleaned a half a dozen of these one morning kept them in the cooler all day and when milt came over that evening proposed a trip to town to get them filled milt was nt able that summer to deny blix anything not even her request that blackie and i go along can manuel come too blackie asked who s manuel milt wanted to know everett s sulphur foreman a mexican sure he wo nt want to go then milt said but he did and milt with his twosome already ruined did nt really care how many more crowded into the back seat of his packard blix was up front with him blackie manuel and i and the twelve melon halves were in back i sat in the middle between blackie and manuel i did nt have to talk blackie took shoulder to knee to ankle there was no possible way i could avoid touching manuel fate does nt often make you gifts like that the trip to town was over in a minute of course and the melon eating did nt take much longer manuel paid milt would have except that he saw that to do so would hurt manuel s pride besides leaving manuel tied up with change making and blackie eating his last half melon to the rind and me waiting for the two of them gave him the opportunity he wanted when manuel blackie and i stepped outside the confectionery the packard was
school if he borrowed from his mother and if he to do with the money there are good questions about her finances did he support her before he died if he did we ll know that he was more involved with her than he let you know maybe he called her from his office i do nt think so she said i think it was as he said he did nt have anything to do with her did you look at his office telephone bills no i will maybe he did borrow from her for the divorce she said that would explain why she was so against it and why she s been friendly with betty he did nt answer he had steered her away from the night maciverhad declined to be photographed spending money he had intended to conceal leland could nt help wondering himself it was too interesting as a public accountant maciver had moved in business circles and there was no telling how law he had done his clients taxes mike did leland s and karen s and the law was that the accountant was as responsible for errors as the man whose name appeared at the top of the form pleland sat up as he felt himself trying to move ahead and gather together what he had learned somehow maciver had made his start and acquired the money for the divorce settlement and from there he had gone on to accumulate a quarter of a million he could have been made a loan by his mother it supported the things norma had just said about the mother s attitude toward her son but leland did nt care about that maciver had been an accountant nothing more and in five years and some months he had earned enough to save two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars no one had said that he had worked very hard he had gone out courted a second wife married her set up a new home he had gone to have won all his money he would have been paying taxes on it right along or his estate would be tied up at this moment while back taxes were being determined how maciver had made his money and why he had died if indeed his death had had anything to do with his money remained as veiled as they had been yesterday when norma had entered leland s office seeing it all in these terms leland could feel the despair of which she had spoken they would get so close and no more they would have to give it up concerned with other issues leland hoped norma drove her late husband s car with sureness and visible enjoyment across the county line into the city of port smith the sky was black now and the roads were still jammed with people going home to dinner port smith was no place for the scant pleasures of late autumn it was gray and damp in the days and in the nights it became so and turned toes and fingers yellow green for lack of circulation every patrolman in port smith knew the trick of ten deep breaths the streets averaged six feet above the water table where the land was soft most of new port smith was mounted on a black glacier scored rock but that provided no better insulation against the weather one of the results of the winter cold was that the people of port smith a sophisticated and comfort conscious lot were hardier and less vulnerable than most americans expected at this point in his life leland both disliked and was concerned with this city the cynicism that was the product of the sophistication and toughness was enough to keep the people from demanding a direction from the government and the increase in the numbers of colored people creating the division of rich from poor along the color line was building a half rational dissatisfaction that was now of subcrisis proportions since the beginning of history cities had built on top of themselves layer upon layer and port smith was no exception stood buildings whose construction no one remembered port smith was rife with citizens committees study groups and action teams composed of people who had not taken part in civic affairs before it was leland s own port smith upbringing that made him wish them well but made him wonderabout the sort of people who ran out nightly to meetings that accomplished nothing that which he thought was most sane inside him considered those people and their meetings as the city s best hope leland lived in manitou now legitimately none of it was his business that most sane thing inside him had to view his concern as only an extension of the satisfaction he felt when he read that port smith college won a baseball game or two in the course of a full season now norma said what i ca nt understand is why he married her that s something we ll never know we d better just forget about it he was young she said he needed someone kaminsky told me that his wife thought that your husband was a terrific character i took it to mean that he was impressive polished and mature it was college but she was twenty two at the time maturity is something college women look for i think he was quiet she said vehemently women mistake quietnessfor maturity he could have been mature yes but he could have been lonely too your dr roberts is the one to see on that leland said are you angry with me you re not waiting for the facts norma now we might just catch something on the state of his mind in those days his wingman could give us some ideas if all else fails that s something to think about for later on in the meantime stop thinking leave that to me
the others ventured to ask his majesty for whom this special prayer was intended my new privado is the queen he replied and dropping on one knee he kissed her hand pand now how much further to agreda not more than a league or so sire there have been days when we have gone no further than that from sunrise to sunset and it is my hope that we may cross the provincial frontier from castile into aragon before nightfall however if we are late in reaching agreda or if we are detained there longer than i expect that will be impossible we shall not be late in reaching agreda sire and we need be detained there no longer than your observed true but they may be kept to the minimum the king sighed without answering and the second speaker don luis de haro true to his role of el discreto saw no point in pursuing the question though word had already reached them that town and gown were preparing special festivities in honor of the royal visit by his own fatigue he could easily gauge the king s and the latter s longing to reach the end of their travels it was more than five weeks since they had left madrid for zaragoza and the journey over rough roads even though it had been made in a superb state coach lined in crimson brocade and provided with a couch on which the king could recline instead of having been made on horseback had been a hard one indeed don luis was disposed to think that the other method would have been easier as well as quicker unfortunately that was contrary to the rules of etiquette not with equerries and outriders and a suitable suite though in this instance the size of the suite had been greatly reduced simplicity like economy according to philip was now to be the order of the day don luis would have been perfectly content if the retrenchment were such that he need not be included among those chosen to accompany the king especially as there had never previously been such prolonged stops at all the convents monasteries and churches along the way alcala de henares guadalajara siguenza medinaceli almazan tajahuercedel campo villar del campo pompous bishops drowsy priors garrulous abbesses it seemed the prayers of all these were needed for the remission of his majesty ssins and the redemption of prostrate spain luis de haro shrugged his shoulders if every time the king committed adultery and despite his pallor and his languor he must be possessed of extraordinary virility the prayers of the faithful were to be elicited they would have time for nothing else if the defenders at rocroy those world famous tercios were not powerful enough to end the long siege of the one and prevent the crushing defeat of the other how could it be hoped that the mumbling patter of cloistered monks would have more effect and then there had been that inexplicable change of plan after leaving guadalajara don luis knew that the king had intended to make the convent of valfermoso de las monjas near utande one of his stops and there had been much speculation among his attendants as to what this might portend and a good many whispered opinions and surreptitious winks not to mention wagers had been exchanged although fourteen years had passed since la calderona had insisted on the rupture of her relations with the king despite his vehement and brokenhearted protests and had entered a convent in the remote badiel valley none of them had forgotten her charm her grace her gentleness she was only a little past thirty now in short she should barely have reached the zenith luis and the others to believe that in seeking her out the king intended to ask only for her prayers oh doubtless the visit would begin correctly enough as philip himself put it the traditional courtesies must be observed the nun two nuns would be on one side of the grille and the king with an at tendant nobleman on the other but philip would soon find a pretext for dismissing both her companion and his then he would give her news of their son the namesake of the king s famous great uncle don juan of austria such a promising boy so handsome so intelligent so manly that everyone in the palace of the zarzuela where he was established in princely fashion was loud in his praises after assuring her of the boy s welfare and progress the king would go on to describe the ceremony which had taken place when their don juan at the age of twelve was brought to madrid and by decree the son of charles v sor dolores was that what she called herself now could not help but be moved by such a recital and when his majesty told her that he would require lodging for the night for himself and his attendants could she refuse to give it to him to be sure she was not another sor margarita who must have been a hussy at heart or she would have found a way with the help of her abbess to make herself inaccessible to the king despite the tunnel leading from villanueva s basement to the cloister of san placido there had never been anything of the hussy about la calderona the king had been her one and only love as don luis himself and a number of others who had tried in vain to prevail against her chastity could testify and she had loved the king as a man and not as a monarch but had she ever ceased to love him despite her flight and her vows and the at the hands of giovanni battista pamfili the papalnuncio had the king ever ceased to love her despite his weakness and his profligacy and his futility don luis did not think so and neither did
and for the love of christ said higgins are you saying he took an involuntary step backward when you told me about that name plate art i suddenly thought about that room on the fourth floor and also what little oscar said that morning we broke the news to quiet here they come let s give them a little surpriseparty reluctantly hackett and higgins joined him in the room on either side of the door faint voices an upset all because of ellie bringing the police down on us when that mexican one said that about a search warrant i really thought i should be sick and if you da told me about it then ben i coulda told you silly damn idea go knock him on the head would nt stop the rest of em i will be glad when this is all over just like ellie to poor woman pencil thin beam of light pausing in the doorway vague dark outlines of the three of them there one figure bending tugging i rather think this must be earl it s lighter poor earl so young to hackett felt the hair was standing straight up on his head a second figure was just bending over the first when mendoza switched on his own powerful flashlight have you got a client at last mr mclaughlin he asked suavely and from pinpointing oscar rapidly swung the light around to show hackett and higgins we would be so interested to hear all about it oscar uttered a high pitched scream and fainted across the coffin before him but in the end it was oscar who was most voluble they carted the three of them off to headquarters where ben kelly just glowered at them and refused to answer any questions at all and henry s burden was i said much better to leave them what he s got me into but revived oscar was almost pathetically eager to talk his hot little brown eyes pleaded for understanding he gestured emotionally you do nt understand how it was of course i know what the law says about bodies but does nt any of you remember how it was the depression you ve got to see how it happened earl poor earl he was only thirty four that was back in nineteen thirty two and it s just terrible to have to tell you we were brought up strictly but the times and living down here such awful people some of them were and i m afraid he got into bad company justa tiny bit drunk and fell down the front stairs and i saw at once his neck was i was just qualified then and my goodness do nt you see a funeral would have cost well there simply was nt any money for it i had actually been put every spare penny into my schooling because we thought a regular business but i had nt had any clients at all and there were the taxes on the hotel not much and ellie usually managed to help with her store we had to keep the taxes up or we would nt have had a roof over our heads you see that and the cost of a funeral even then those times well we talked it all over you see the family i mean and we did nt see any reason why not the whole problem solved so easily and the money saved for the taxes quite practical really except of course for the body but i thought of the top story and i do assure you everything was always done according to law except for actual burial absolutely hygienic i m a good undertaker i know my job the coffins were lined with lead and just in case i lined that room with simply told people earl had gone you see how it was and you just went on the same way asked mendoza unwillingly fascinated oh well ellie had nt believed in doctors said oscar vaguely jane was different but they could nt ever afford and dorothy had nt been going to a doctor either that had looked very much like a heart attack to him we do have to know some medicine you know and besides stephen and william were both gone by then stephen had liver trouble and willie oscar thought had had a stroke and each time it had all gone off without any trouble of course i had everything to hand and really i assure you we held a nice little service for all of them not that we were raised in any sect father was a lifelong agnostic but the proper respect due the poor dead clay was who oh well oscar floundered into long winded explanations first there had been an old woman amanda tucker who d lived at the hotel gone out cleaning for her living found dead in bed one day when no one had seen her for a while and someone looked and she had nt had any money and well yes i did know that the authorities would take care of it if i but after all i am an undertaker and really it seemed easier and besides one likes to keep one s hand in and so i just mendoza looked at hackett the routine oscar had fallen into in lieu of legitimate clients mr brown it emerged had been another roomer died only three months ago and now oscar was chatteringabout ben s brother if i can make you understand all done with respect and taste but of course i did know how the law reads but so narrow well i was so upset when i heard you say about searching and i only thought you attacked me that night mr mclaughlin i m very very sorry said oscar earnestly i see now it was a foolish thing to do henry said so and i m not a violent
there was every evidence that name to go into the new hampshire primary and had soundly trounced both orrin and ted each of whom had maintained that their backers had acted without their permission of course the president had maintained the same thing and undoubtedlyeach of the three had been convinced that his own desire to remain aloof had been quite genuine nonetheless there they all were in the contest and the president had won by a landslide then he had again permitted his name to go into the wisconsin primary this time by dint of vehement insistence and threats of all sorts of dire reprisals against their overeager lieutenants both orrin and ted had managed to stay out and give him a clear field and again he had won by a landslide meanwhile at his press conferences he had played a game of half answer and jocular sidestep worthy of his predecessor at his peak nobody had pinned him down yet though many skilled people had tried and always for the record he had firmly and without equivocation reiterated the statement succession a year ago he would not be a candidate for re election with this combination of noble purpose on the one hand and political flirtation on the other he had successfully kept the matter in his own hands and had as orrin told him paralyzed the two potential contenders who were so anxious to succeed him the secretary of state who was certainly not one to be let alone by walter dobius and his capable of honorworld in such a personally embarrassing situation found himself subjected to a constant barrage of questioning whenever he exposed him self to the press be it at formal press conference or in one of those hur ried running interrogatories that always accompany the arrival and departure of a secretary of state before the committees of the con congress this was an old game and both he and his questioners played it with a certain humor but the constant necessity to deny his own ambitions and maintain with a straight face that he saw no evidence of the president s would sometimes in little mood for jovial chitchat this put an extra burden on beth but fortunately her long experience as an old campaigner s wife usually came to the rescue in time the more he thought about it now as the limousine crossed wis cousin avenue passed ward circle and made the final run into spring valley the less patient and less tolerant he felt about the president harley was obviously about to be confronted by a major demarche on the part of the jasons in this speech by walter dobius a dramatic rallying behind ted of all the psychological and actual forces walter could command the president could still act but apparently he was unable to see that his area of action would inevitably be restricted to some degree as soon as all of walter s friends and sup porters came out on saturday with their columns and editorials their news reports and their special television and radio playbacks that would the secretary knew flood the country over the weekend a massive barrage of public formed in the wake of walter s speech the longer the president waited the more difficult it would be for him to escape its oppressive and hampering confines as for his own position the secretary decided as the car drew up at his door and he bade the driver good night with wishes for a safe journey back downtown it inevitably would have to be just what he had told beth earlier in the day he would have to announce his own candidacy whether the president liked it or not and he would have to plunge immediately into his campaign he had a reasonably good organization in most of the states party leaders who had supported him twice before in his unsuccessful tries for the nomination and had given active indication they would again he had a modest amount of money and a few substantially moneyed backers he had his name and his record he had beth he had himself he was not afraid of the future but as he stamped the snow from his boots hall closet and went along to the comfortable living room where he knew she would be reading in front of the fire he could have wished that it were arriving a little more on his terms well she said closing the book new myths and old realities by one of walter s more outspoken competitors in the great seesaw of american opinion and looking up with a smile how did it go he wants to run but he wants someone to tell him to and did you the secretary made a quizzical sound i certainly did and is he he shook his head in an impatient way oh of course not it will have to be done over and over and all the while he ll be inching closer and closer suddenly one day he ll find himself in it he frowned meanwhile walter will have made his speech and it will all end up in a very embarrassing tangle but that s what happens when you have conscience in the white house the white house always wins but conscience has to have its day i m sure he has other motives than just ego beth said and the secretary nodded quickly oh certainly i m not denying harley s integrity or good heart but it puts me on the spot right enough all right then she said briskly when do we hit the road he gave her a humorously grateful smile and immediately looked more relaxed hank he said i think you re more bloodthirsty about this than i am when do you want to hit the road it would be a little premature before walter s speech would nt it he called by
each of them above the co hong is the emperor s personal squeeze chief we callhim the hoppo he s responsible for squeezing the mandarins at canton the co hong and he s the biggest trader of opium by the way and makes a fortune out of it so if you allow one mandarin on hong kong you allow the whole tai pan book system the mandarin will be a hoppo every chinese will be subject to him every chinese trader who comes to trade will be sold licenses and squeezed and in turn they ll squeeze us the hoppo will destroy those who will help us and help those who hate us and they ll never give up until

be chinese for an hour or so he thought wearily then i d be able to finesse a million taels from somewhere with nae trouble if that s the answer he told himself then try to think barbarians the mandarin with unlimited power what s the point of power if you dinna use it to twist joss to help yoursel how can you use your power who has a million taels whom can you pressure to get it who owes you favors what should we do dirk i mean i quite agree longstaff said you d better send ti sen an immediate dispatch tell him no order him struan stopped abruptly as his brain cleared his fatigue vanished you re a stupid blathering half witted billy ti sen ti sen s your key one mandarin that s all you have to arrange two simple steps first cancel longstaff s agreement as it must be canceled anyway second in a week or two make a secret offer to ti sen that in return for a million in bullion you ll make longstaff reverse his stand and allow one mandarin into hong kong ti sen will leap at

richest and the most cunning of the co bong and your major supplier and you ve known him twenty years he s the one wi out a doubt one mandarin will guarantee the future of the noble house aye but he will wreck hong kong and destroy the plan do you gamble to outsmart them later that s a terrible risk you know one mandarin means the whole system you canna leave that devil legacy for robb or for culum or for their children but wi out the bullion there s nae noble house and nae future you were saying dirk order ti sen in the queen s name to forget a mandarin on hong kong my thought entirely

means write this to ti sen at canton a special proclamation only her britannic majesty queen victoria has the authority to appoint officials in the british island of hong kong there will be no chinese officials here and no customshouses whatsoever he hesitated then continued deliberately sensing that the timing was right colony of hong kong will henceforth be british subjects and subject only to the laws of england but that exceeds my authority it s custom for plenipotentiaries to exceed their authority that s why they re so carefully selected will that s why we ve an empire raffles hastings clive raleigh wellington you have the plenipotentiary authority of her majesty s government to arrange a treaty with china what do they know or care about china at home but you re an innovator a maker of history will you re ready to accept one tiny barren almost uninhabited island when it s a world custom to grab whole continents when you could take all china if you wanted you re so much smarter longstaff wavered and sucked the top of the quill yes but i ve already agreed that chinese on hong kong would be subject to chinese law all forms of torture excepted a bead of sweat gathered on treaty and i issued a special proclamation you ve changed your mind will just as ti sen changed his there was no clause to appoint a mandarin but it was understood not in your mind or mine he s trying to dupe you as he did over chushan quite longstaff agreed happy to be convinced you re right dirk absolutely if we allow any control you re right they ll go back to their old devilment what yes and it s time the chinese saw what justice really is law and order yes you re right end the letter like the emperor would fear this and tremblingly obey and sign it with your full title struan said and opened

would inhabit in the days to come it could nt be nicer he said to debbie you look beautiful we re going to take more photographs later she said i want apicture of you in that tuxedo all the girls are looking at you youlook so handsome do nt you oh you mean norman s sister yes she looks fine she likes you debbie said let s stick to your wedding jonas said jonas please do nt get into trouble do nt wont i wo nt mr prager the elder tapped jonas on the shoulder please young man she s my daughter in law now after debbie and norman had changed into other clothes and had left in a taxi for penn station the wedding guests departed solomon tried to persuade the hartford branch of the family to spend the night in new york as guests of the goulds but with thanks nat rothenberg declined he had to be in the market at six o clock in the morning they had their chevy a couple of hours and they were in hartford the pragers wanted solomon and jonas to come to their house which was not far and now it was solomon s these clothes norman s brother arthur drove them to borough hall where they took a subway home the eleven o clock news was nt good the germans had bombed the british north sea fleet german aircraft had sown so many mines around the approaches to london s port that all shipping had to be rerouted currents of silence flowed from that corner of the apartment which was debbie s room solomon and jonas sat in the living room and listened to that silence and to the news of war pabits continue the cleaning woman continued to come once a week and solomon and jonas continued in their practice of dusting and vacuuming between times dishes were not left in the sink solomon brought home fruits in season as debbie had done and although some of them rotted he replenished the supply as though not to do so would open a door to the kind of dereliction debbie had feared jonas even continued to set mousetraps but he often forgot to look to see if he had since returning from her honeymoon she found things quite satisfactory recommending only that the bed sheets be changed every week fresh sheets gave a fresh turn to each week a psychological necessity fresh sheets and fresh fruits and a regimen of cleanliness maintaineda semblance of the life jonas had known he was nt lonely indeed he was more occupied than he had ever been before but each time he entered the apartment there came at him along with the ghost of debbie s appleblossom which he could nt be sure he actually smelled or conjured seance like in his imagination a quality of silence that brushed his senses so teasingly that he often slipped in quickly and noiselessly listening intently as though to take it unawares and perhaps discover its meaning it was the most evanescent of surface tensions breaking at the whisper of his own breathing leaving him with the blank familiarity of furniture that had hurriedly conspired to keep its secret the secret was one he learned in time at odd moments when he was doing some routine thing reading or passing through the rooms on his way out then out of apcorner of his mind s eye he would catch a spectral glitter of that surface tension hovering over a chair or a table or a whole room and a hollowness would carve itself in his heart he thought at first he was only being reminded of debbie but reminders of debbie had their own solid impacts easily recognized and easily rationalized this was different the message was from the objects themselves a plaintiveness seemed to emanate from a chair a table as if they had lost contact with that continuity which makes the things of a home part of the mortal rhythm separated from that continuity they had become mere pieces of wood he had consigned them to that fate and their secret was no more than his realization that he had done so the element that had made these objects a part of time was drawn from them when debbie left will or interest or love or whatever was required to restore that element several times during the autumn months while the weather still permitted jonas had played handball and while playing had spotted ira s head above the parapet after the games they had walked along the wide street then empty of sunning citizens and had talked of the war its coming seemed to have settled some of the ferment in ira he told jonas that clowning around had to stop somewhere short of universal disaster besides he had said the woods are full of third rate comedians jonas had refrained from saying that ira was not third rate although he suspected that the other would even now listen with glum gladness to what needed no telling they did nt go into manhattan during those few smoky deciduous afternoons in october and november but stayed rather in the gould apartment which ira liked to do listening to the philharmonic drinking coffee talking once the theatre crowd all those hopeful and hopeless ones you do nt ever see them do you he asked which ones jonas asked taken with a sudden strong need to talk of himself oh any of them ira returned no you would nt you have no interest in that crowd do you in the crowd no jonas said i see ruth ruth ruth klein yes ira regarded him in puzzlement for a moment then shook his head he gave a little snort of laughter when did that begin he asked way back jonas told him seems like way back july and it s still going strong seems to she want to divorce
but because of the perilous conditions of transportation deep fords fallen trees and washed out roads making intercourse between the various tidewater estates in each case a major venture not to be considered lightly in a great while however every two years or so usually in the late summer when the crops were laid by marse samuel would decide to have what he called humorously an assemblage and a score of people would come from miles around planters and their families from the james and chickahominy rivers and from down in north carolina people with names like carter and harrison and byrd and clark and bonner arriving in elegant coaches and accompanied by a hustling noisy entourage of black nursemaidsand body servants they would stay for four or five days sometimes as long as a week and daily there would be fox hunts with the hounds of major vaughan whose plantation was not far away and turkey shoots and contests in horsemanship pistol matches and picnics and a great deal of contented somnolent easy palaver among the ladies on the veranda and at least two fancy balls in the great hall bedecked for each evening s merriment in yards of pink and blue bunting i had reached the age of sixteen or thereabouts to act in the capacity of chief usher a title which marse samuel bestowed upon me and which involved my supervision of all the negro help outside of the kitchen it is possibly a measure of marse samuel s confidence in me that he entrusted me with this position as young as i happened to be doubtless on the other hand i simply was quicker and smarter than all the rest caparisoned for a week in purple velvet knee length pantaloons a red silk jacket with buckles of shiny brass and a white goat s hair wig which culminated behind in a saucy queue i must have presented an exotic sight to the carters and the byrds but i reveled in my role and took great pleasure in bustling about and lording it over the other black boys most of them enlisted from the fields dumb callow kids all thumbs and knobby knees and popping eyes even though each day i was kept feverishly busy from dawn to dusk it the ladies dismount i too who rode herd on lucas and todd and pete and tim making certain that they polished each night each gentleman s boots that they cleaned up the litter on the lawn that they hurried about ceaselessly fetching ice from the ice cellar retrieving a lady s lost fan tethering horses untethering them doing this undoing that i was the first to arise long before dawn to help little morning prepare daily a stirrup cup of whiskey for the fox hunt was one of my most important chores and nearly always the last to retire and the fact that i was up and about at a truly unearthly hour was the only reason that caused me one morning between ball and hunt to nearly stumble over miss emmeline and someone else in the moonless and murky dark it was not the loud whisper of her voice that shocked me so much though i instantly distinguished it but the lord s name in her mouth uttered in a heard blasphemy on a woman s tongue and so astonished was i by the words that as i stood there rooted in the dark it did not just then occur to me to consider the event which occasioned them and i thought she was in some great and nameless peril oh mercy oh god oh jesus wait oh jesus now wait quick put it back now then slowly oh jesus christ slowly wait a man s soft groan from the lawn behind the hedge now made me aware of the other presence and i remained half paralyzed fascinated yet suddenly sick nearly unto death at the sound of the saviour s name spoken thus as if he had been stripped shamelessly naked by the hot urgency of her lips wait wait she again implored and a gentle sigh came from the man s throat and mercy mercy wait now slowly oh jesus oh christ oh christ oh yes now oh mercy mercy mercy abruptly then in a prolonged and dwindling little sob the voice died and all was silent and i could hear nothing but the piping of frogs in the millpond and a dull thumping of horses against the stable stalls and the sound of my own heart racing madly so loud that i thought surely it must be heard above the soughing of a night wind in the sycamore trees i stood there unable to move my spirit a shambles from chagrin and shock and fear and i recall thinking wretchedly this is what comes of being a nigger it ai nt fair if i was nt a nigger i would nt find out about things i do nt want to find out about it ai nt fair then impassioned tremulous oh my love em my love my love em my love but there was no reply from miss emmeline and time crept by slowly and painfully like something crippled and old causing my mouth to go dry and a numbness premonitory with the clammy touch of death to spread a tingling chill through my legs and thighs at last i heard her voice again placid now composed but edged with contempt and bitterness finally you ve accomplished what you ve been after for ages i hope you re satisfied oh em my love my love he whispered let me stay away from me she said her voice rising now in the darkness stay away from me do you hear if you touch me if you say another word to me i ll tell papa i ll tell papa and he ll shoot you for ravishing your own cousin protested you consented to oh
butler to a bookstore in town to procure a complete english translation of xenophon s banquet the university greek faculty to locate one she wondered whether her reading of the dialogue helped her to grasp at least partially the goings on that then occurred in her house galled by reuben s neglect and wearied with the interminably long evenings amos had a diabolical inspiration he remembered the swedish gardener whose principal task was to keep the rooms of the great house supplied with flowers from his nursery recently a widower he lived alone in servants quarters a short distance down the ravine and his appearance was striking enough that amos felt he would have graced a banquet at which socrates was a guest more becomingly than aristocratic reuben himself in the middle of the night disturbing mrs masterson who took the boy s exiting steps for those of her grandson s return from carousing amos an indian bathrobe thrown over his pure silk scarlet pajamas carefully adjusting his usual nocturnal erection walked confidently to the swede s cottage whistling a little tune at the door he knocked loudly and waited still whistling the knocking and admitted his guest through sheer astonishment once inside amos had no intention of leaving again for he had got chilled through and through from the raw air and the sight of bootes rising in the east had made his teeth chatter when reuben did not answer her imperious is that finally you mrs masterson rose threw a quilt about her shoulders and opened the door of her grandson s bedroom surprised at the absence of both reuben and his favorite and feeling now suddenly a bit light headed she sat down at amos s desk her eyes fell on a half finished letter the boy had written to cousin ida under this letter lay a handful of others opened and thumb printed by his reading bearing an indecipherable illinois postmark with the sender s name ida henstridge mrs masterson struggled with her conscience only briefly then she read avidly not only amos s unfinished epistle but with even more rapt attention all those cousin ida had written her of warm air brought her immediately back to long forgotten thoughts and feelings and relationships before her marriage she read of cousin ida blaming herself defending herself and at last crying out against amos s unjust bitterness and accusations against his lot cousin ida begged him to have patience trust hope to thank his benefactors even though he could not stand the rich as exemplified at any rate by reuben and the old lady of the castle she begged amos to put up with the shows of wealth now as he had with poverty and going without and to remember he was a man and that meant he could be free i would give anything sometimes if i had been born a man for then i would not have to sit here and wonder where my next dollar was coming from but on the other hand i would not be the mother of a fine son like you and that makes up for all the rest dearest amos she day and she and ida had told the tea leaves to see what lay in store for amos and then they had got down together on the rag rug in the kitchen and prayed that things would go better for him in the future but if they do nt dear amos come home remember the welcome sign is always out there were other details the canary had died and she would nt get another but would leave the cage in its old place widow martin down the alley had taken away her membership in the church because of her disliking the new preacher s wife the refinery was being sued by the town for its failure to control the suffocating fumes and bad odors it let loose i am glad she concluded mr masterson shows you such strong affection and interest for there never is any word from your father and i wonder amos if maybe he is nt dead having read all the letters foreboding and sudden extreme giddiness she desperately hoped reuben might come in for she felt too weak to call out for the servants then her eye fell on a slender sheaf of pages over which was scrawled visits from a sleepwalker she read uninterrruptedly absorbed for an hour more still yawning in huge paroxysms the swedish gardner sven studied his late caller his command of english being negligible and a man of few words in his own tongue he took off his thick slippers and curled up beside his self invited visitor he recognized amos as the guest of mr masterson and in his bewildered way decided that owing to an influx of guests at the great house either the old lady or master reuben himself had sent the boy to ease the overflow after the light was extinguished he was soon put to a different view of matters at the floodgate of affection which amos stung by his having lost daniel haws and being shut up away from everything in the country poured out love by his wife s death yielded too easily after the first appeasement of feeling the gardener was bold enough to ask why amos s feet were so hard and horny for he could not help comparing them to his wife s whose toes had been like cotton when pressed against him amos explained that he was an inveterate walker from his earliest childhood in the country and had spent most of his time in chicago on the streets exploring every inch of the city afoot at this the gardener with a certain uneasy superstitious dread in his voice asked if the boy would show him his feet amos willingly obliged and placed his toes on a white rug that lay by the bed the gardener who slept
up to the shan as the evening wore further on subsequent to the dessert the shan grew more and more inclined to close his eyes and let his head slump forward for longer and longer periods of time good party he muttered between snores and finally elephants are no damn good at all and so passed to sleep and could not be awakened his kinsmen did not see fit to escort him home at this time because of the fact that the prince s physician had added chloral hydrate to their wine and they were at that moment sprawled upon the floor snoring the prince s chief courtier arranged with hawkana for their accommodation and the shan himself was taken to siddhartha s suite where he was shortly visited by the physician who loosened his voice tomorrow afternoon he was saying you will be prince siddhartha and these will be your retainers you will report to the hall of karma in their company to claim there the body which brahma has promised you without the necessity of prior judgment you will remain siddhartha throughout the transfer and you will return here in the company of your retainers to be examined by me do you understand yes whispered the shan then repeat what i have told you tomorrow afternoon said the shan i will be siddhartha commanding these retainers bright bloomed the morning and debts were settled beneath it half of the prince s men rode out of the city heading north when they were out of sight of mahartha they began circling to the southeast working their way through the hills stopping only to don their battle gear half a dozen men were dispatched to the street of the contents of which were divided into the pouches of three dozen men who departed after breakfast into the city the prince took counsel with his physician narada saying if i have misjudged the clemency of heaven then am i cursed indeed but the doctor smiled and replied i doubt you misjudged and so they passed from morning into the still center of day the ridge of the gods golden above them when their charges awakened they ministered to their hangovers the shan was given a posthypnotic and sent with six of siddhartha s retainers to the palace of the masters his kinsmen were assured that he remained sleeping in the prince s quarters our major risk at this point said the physician is the shan will he be recognized the factors in our favor are that he is a minor potentate from a distant kingdom he has only been in town for a short period of time has spent most of that himself for judgment the masters should still be unaware of your own physical appearance unless i have been described to them by brahma or his priest said the prince for all i know my communication may have been taped and the tape relayed to them for identification purposes why though should this have been done inquired narada they should hardly expect stealth and elaborate precautions of one for whom they are doing a favor no i think we should be able to pull it off the shan would not be able to pass a probe of course hut he should pass surface scrutiny accompanied as he is by your retainers at the moment he does believe he is siddhartha and he could pass any simple lie detection test in that regard which i feel is the most serious obstacle he might encounter so they waited and the three dozen men returned with empty pouches gathered their belongings mounted town as though in search of revelry but actually drifting slowly in a southeasterly direction good bye good hawkana said the prince as the remainder of his men packed and mounted i shall bear as always good report of your lodgings to all whom i meet about the land i regret that my stay here must be so unexpectedly terminated but i must ride to put down an uprising in the provinces as soon as i leave the hall of karma you are aware of how these things spring up the moment a ruler s back is turned so while i should have liked to spend another week beneath your roof i fear that this pleasure must be postponed until another time if any ask after me tell them to seek me in hades hades my lord it is the southernmost province of my kingdom noted for its excessively warm weather be sure to phrase it just so especially to the priests whereabouts in days to come i ll do that my lord and take especial care of the boy dele i expect to hear him play again on my next visit hawkana bowed low and was about to begin a speech so the prince decided upon that moment to toss him the final bag of coins and make an additional comment as to the wines of urath before mounting quickly and shouting orders to his men in such a manner as to drown out any further conversation then they rode through the gateway and were gone leaving behind only the physician and three warriors whom he was to treat an additional day for an obscure condition having to do with the change of climate before they rode on to catch up with the others they passed through the town using side streets and came after a time to the roadway that led up toward the palace of the masters of karma as they passed along its length siddhartha exchanged secret in hiding at various points off in the woods when they had gone half the distance to the palace the prince and the eight men who accompanied him drew rein and made as if to rest waiting the while for the others to move abreast of them passing carefully among the trees before long however they saw movement on the
the street in order not to look at the people on the bus i wondered how we were ever going to fox them if we could nt even into the eyes of a red faced black haired corpulent man who had briefly and idly looked up from his newspaper his hair was very well combed his face was very well shaven his nails were manicured his shoes gleamed his suit and his topcoat were expensive he was wearing cufflinks and i could almost smell his toilet water i do nt know what was in my eyes base envy i think base hatred and great wonder but whatever it was held his wandering not altogether hostile nor altogether amused attention for a second or so he glanced at my brother then he returned to his newspaper then all of my ambitions seemed flat and ridiculous how could we fox them if we could neither bear to look at them nor bear it when they looked at us and who were they anyway which was the really terrible the boomeranging question and one always felt maybe they re right maybe you are nothing or the life they make you lead is the only life you deserve they say that god said so and if god said so then you mean about as much to god as you do to this red faced black haired fat white man fuck god fuck you too mister but there he sat just the same impervious gleaming and redolent with safety rustling as it were the scriptures in which i appeared only as the object lesson we got off the bus near madison square garden i think the circus was in town for the garden was surrounded by policemen and the streets were full of dazzledmen and women and children the streets were full of a noise like gaiety but one realized that it could not be gaiety when one looked at the thin lips and the flashing spectacles the crisply toasted curled hair of the ladies when one listened to the brutal denigrating lewd voices of the men and watched their stretched lips cunning tyrannical wail of the children vaguely and vocally dissatisfiedby the fair and when one watched the policemen who moved through the crowd on foot or on horseback as though the crowd were cattle there were no movies on this avenue and so we turned off it walking east moving now with now against the current sometimes separated by it often stopped sometimes in searching for each other spun around people looked into storewindows and so did we walked in and out of stores but we did nt bother and they were visible behind the plate glass windows of cafeterias sitting in my memory bolt upright or wandering about with trays the crowd no doubt would have described itself as friendly a fair observation would have been that they were in a holiday mood but their holidays were emphatically not my holidays i had too often been the occasion of their fearful celebrations and i did not feel any friendliness and a mortal danger i kept my hands in my pockets and so did caleb so i could not be accused of molesting any of the women who jostled past and kept my eyes carefully expression less so i could not be accused of lusting after the women or desiring the death of the men when my countrymen were on holiday their exuberance took strange forms and i was aware for the first time though not for the last that i was with caleb whose danger since he was so much more visible was greater than mine it was not here and not now and not among these people that he could protect me by his size on the contrary our roles were reversed and here now among these people it was my size and my presumed innocence which might operate as protection for him he was not walking beside me a burly black man prowling the streets but an attentive older brother taking his little brother sightseeing envied metropolis of new york my presence potentially at least proved his innocence and goodwill and also bore witness to the charity and splendor of the people to whom i owed so much and from whom i had so much to learn we came to broadway and the great marquees you going to have your name up there in lights little leo caleb asked with a smile yes i said i will you wait and see little leo said caleb on the great white way it wo nt be so white i said when i get through with it caleb threw back his head and laughed people turned to look at us but i made my eyes very big as i looked up at caleb and carefully not at them and they saw what i had wanted them to see some of them smiled too happy that we were enjoying what movie you want us to see and i will bow to your judgment man because i see you are becomingan expert well in fact i realized as i scanned the procession of marquees there was nt anything playing that i was really dying to see i had outgrown my taste for some movies without having acquired any real taste for others but of course i did not know how to say this i had begun to be interested in foreign movies mostly russian and french but i did nt think that caleb would especially like seeing a foreign movie so i said well let s look if you see something you like before i see something i like why we ll go and see that and if i see something i like before you see something you like why we ll go and see that okay okay he said amused seeming also to we wandered through the holiday crowds stopping now beneath this marquee
ever forget he was older than she a slim spectacled man of no particular coloring but rather a male man she suspected and so she merely smiled driving herself early the next morning along the parkway toward new hampshire however it occurred to her that one of her difficulties perhaps was that indeed she never moment of the hours she had spent with kim christopher nor could she forget the changing looks upon his too expressive face his disappointment when he found that he was not to be with his father his brave silence and the glitter of tears in his eyes no her absorption in her work these last two days had not made her forget the boy s urgent need and not forgetting she had for the first time in her life consciously and willfully deceived chris chris she had said last night over the telephone i sha nt come home tomorrow as i had planned i am staying on another two or three days you ll be late for the fourth he exclaimed no i sha nt be i ll get in not a moment later than the midnight of the third possibly the second and be worn out the next day not worn out the next day he had yielded to her words of love how right her decision had been was clear to her now after the long quiet day of driving alone she had finished her task at the laboratories leaving with her colleagues a brief clear statement of her conclusions and with peace in her mind the peace that only completed work well done could bring her she had turned her inner attention to the matter of kim christopher slowly as the hours passed she had come to the conclusion that the situation could no longer be allowed to hang fire the boy must either join them as chris s son or she would take him back to korea and his mother that is if she could so persuade chris her mind quieted by at least this much decision she drew in at sunset to the grounds of the waite school for boys she had purposely not announced her coming she wanted to see christopher as he was without the preliminary excitement of expecting her arrival she wanted to come upon him wherever evening meal she stopped at the main building a colonial structure of white painted wood with green shutters at the windows and rang the bell an older boy answered it is dr bartlett here she asked he s still in his office i think but he s just about to go home probably catch him for me please she said tell him it is mrs chris winters she had lingered in the hall only a moment when she saw dr bartlett loping toward her his long stride hastened by the surprise evident on his face mrs winters he cried is something wrong no she explained simply that i thought i d drop by and see how christopher is doing very well very well he said come in i ll send for him may i just go to him wherever he is i d speak they found him in the library otherwise empty at this hour there on a window seat catching the last of the evening light he was reading a large book upon the sill christopher here is a surprise for you the headmaster said he looked up she saw at once that he was thin much thinner than he had been but when he leaped to his feet she saw also that he was much taller you come to see me he breathed to her horror he hesitated and then leaning his head against her shoulder he began to weep she put her arms around him and held him and turned a reproachful look upon the surprised dr bartlett has he been unhappy the boy answered for himself he lifted his head and smiled through the tears wet on his face i am happy now he said you come to see me thank you he s course there has been some depression after all it s a strange country for him and in a manner you and mr winters are still strangers to him they had not told him who the boy was and though it must have been evident to the eyes of a wise headmaster no questions had been asked and so no answers were necessary should she tell him the truth later when they were alone he was still talking you must nt take these tears too seriously mrs winters i ve been several times in asia and indeed spent months in japan during the occupation and i remember that it is not thought a disgrace in asia for a man to weep rather it is considered a sign of sensitivity and feeling our christopher has both these attributes i have discovered of course he has problems perhaps we ll discuss it she said with resolution meanwhile can you put me up for the night room christopher sup pose you take her to the east room and then you may bring her to dinner with you i ll have your bag brought in mrs winters now i ll leave you with your boy after all it is he you came to visit he left them and she was touched that christopher did not feel himself too old to clasp her hand as they went down the hall noisy with crowding boys turning eastwarddown a corridor he opened a door and followed her into the room a pleasant place she observed all chintz and white organdy she sat down in a cushioned chair and putting out her hand she drew the boy to her side now let me see you she said you are tall you are thin do you eat enough he nodded suddenly shy to her surprise she saw his eyes fill again with
grasp of hard realities as the liberal democrats in spite of himself he had had a feeling of relief that day when the questioning shifted south and to the republicans when one of the latter said doctor about this watchful waiting it does nt mean that you will just sit on your asses down there strike that i mean duffs until the communists take over does it the assistant secretary had allowed himself a responding smile and assured the senator it did not he had been equally grateful for the next question doctor can you tell me from your experience if it is a well organized tactic of the communist conspiracy to begin by getting control of the educational system and the police worth campbell this had certainly been a pattern there was nothing rigid about communist tactics on the next question however he had applied the brakes doctor i appreciate your having to be careful in this matter now is it not a fact that in this country this new man mire has put two well known and proclaimed communists in charge of education and the police the questioner had permitted himself a glance at his col leagues there had been the slight hush that always marks the really significant question i think it would be premature senator to say that they are proclaimed communists campbell had replied then measuring his words he had continued i can tell you that we are keeping the situation under very close scrutiny very close i certainly can say we are concerned even o donnell who was along was agreeably surprised at his cautious tone had the committee called o donnell to the witness chair they would have received a different and not did not contemplate nor did o donnell expect it god is known to assign intelligence somewhat at random but in the united states government godless and god fearing agree that it must be exploited strictly in accordance with official rank in the weeks following the senate hearing puerto santos passed from the news and according to worth campbell s calculation the extent of the danger thus further increased as opportunity presented itself he warned of the continuing danger one excellent chance presented itself when pethwick was invited to attend an off the record session of the council on foreign relations in new york the policy was to keep pethwick under wraps his past commitment to martinez invited questions however well answered which in the case of pethwick could not be guaranteed the questions reminded people of things that could usefully be forgotten campbell had the invitation shifted to himself he also enjoyed attending meetings of the council like all meetings this was in the council s headquarters in the harold pratt house on park avenue the pratts were nearly the monopoly of standard oil and the first rockefeller the terms were magnificent and so accordingly is the house that harold pratt built in so especially is the library with its handsome portraits of past leaders of american foreign policy deep rugs gleaming mahogany and two towering floors of bookshelves with a gallery surrounding the second it was here rather than in a larger room that this meeting was held puerto santos enlists the interest only of the more devoted members the devoted membership of the council includes a few columbia university professors and a number of former under secretaries and assistant secretaries of the departments of state and defense for whom it continues a nostalgic association with an experience that all found more exciting although financially less remunerative than the practice of law to which they have since reluctantly returned it also includes a larger number of lawyers and business executives with no washington experience who are genuinely interested in foreign affairs or who feel guilty about their primary preoccupation with making money or who hope to inform themselves of developments yet unknown to the public hope to secure new clients or make useful friends those who seek information are of some slight concern to the elder statesmen of the council for there is a question whether public officials should provide them in confidence with intelligence that other and equally necessitous lawyers or executives are not allowed to hear nor do they like to rely on the obvious justification which is that little information of any novelty is ever imparted this sadly is the case speeches or articles on foreign policy almost never depend for their interest on their contents they almost always depend on the importance of the author naturally not much is missed by those who are not allowed to hear an authoritative exposition of the already known in his mature years worth campbell had found the council a great aid to morale at the university at the white house now in the senate and in the persons of bill o donnell joe hurd and other younger foreign serviceofficers he had found that unclarity of view about communismand the cold war which increasingly had blighted reassurance it was still dominated almost as an alumni association by the men who served with him in berlin and paris or under dulles they understood and accepted as did worth campbell the clear lessons of their own experience they mistrusted those who were not similarly qualified perhaps some younger men had doubts they did not voice them for naturally they wanted to establish the kind of confidence among their elders that produces friends or even clients in this sympathetic environment worth campbell had warned frankly about madera and ryan and the ability of mire to control them he reminded his audience of the pattern of past communist tactics and added his purely personal opinion that the two cabinet officers were biding their time this meant that puerto santos was still a trouble spot he spoke of the unwisdom of taking at face value some of the newspaper accounts now coming out of puerto santos most of those present he felt would suppose
to proceed to the village the original meeting place proposed by general ham when general mah came back to our headquarters from the american command he wanted to revise the plan and now wanted me not to contact generalalm that is he did nt want general alm to be at the rendezvous he would not explain why and he is not accustomed to having his subordinates question his motives colonel jung said then does this mean you have nt alerted colonel hwang of the airborne his paratroopers where are they now as far as general alm is concerned take place he knows that it will take place sometime tonight of course from my point of view since he will not have time to move his commandos out of seoul even if he found out about the rendezvous now and even if he did he would nt know where to have them go i thought it unnecessary to mobilize the paratroopers we have enough men out here as it is you may be sure of that said colonel jung so you are not expecting general alm i would nt be too sure of that said colonel min no you are right said colonel son you can never be sure of anything with general mah do nt forget he still has a hatful of tricks left one thing we can be sure of though is that general ahn s commandos are not going to show up anywhere tonight actually it saves much time and trouble for us now after i talk with him on radio he will arrive here let us say in ten minutes he should if he is going to appear at all when he comes he will ask to see general ham well he will know he is not here i will have to say something to him about that now then what what do we do after that you d better leave it to me from that point on said colonel min i ll do the talking all right just give us the word said colonel son i checked my watch again one minute to eleven it s time i said all right said colonel min let s get this over with we all walked over to colonel son s jeep there was no driver he had driven out himself colonel son radioed have you caught the rat have no but i have caught the fox no but i have caught the fox is that his voice said colonel jung colonel min nodded it is colonel son turned his shadowy face to colonel min colonel min whispered all right go ahead colonel son radioed back bring the fox bring the fox he waited for a few moments then switched off the radio colonel jung said i d better go and stay with my men i will be over there behind the bushes i ve piled sandbags there colonel son so if you need a cover just run for it i ll move your jeep he started the jeep good luck he drove the jeep to the northern edge of the runway in the center of it reversed the jeep so that it faced the western entrance to the airstrip turn all the lights on running toward us sorry colonel min i forgot all about the searchlights i have two searchlights set up and ready how could i have forgotten about that one is halfway up the hill beyond the western entrance and the other one is up there beyond the bush so if the searchlights go on do nt be alarmed they are ours the special agents had been gathered by colonel min he said to everyone we have a change of plan when i want you to fire i ll do what i told you before i ll clasp my hands behind my back three seconds i ll drop down to the ground we will turn off all the lights out here and colonel jung you ll have your searchlights turned on is that clear colonel jung said to the senior agent i want one of your jeeps moved to that end of the runway not the one with the caliber what do a rocket launcher sir and submachine guns good have the rocket launcher ready will you let s have three of you stay with the o caliber how many submachine guns enough for everyone here sir all right then have two of you in the other jeep and now major lee and lieutenant cho major lee will stay in the jeep said colonel min until i call him you too lieutenant cho yes sir said lieutenant cho colonel jung said to the senior agent give them the submachine guns they are in the jeep already all right good luck colonel jung went back to his position behind the bushes i do nt see the l said colonel son it s up there somewhere said colonel min it was suddenly still and hushed the see only the dim shreds of light through the clouds the air was warm and damp colonel min said quietly to me when general mah s sedan or whatever he is going to be in appears colonel son will wait till he comes close enough colonelson will then move toward general mah and at that point i want you to get off the jeep and come slowly and with a submachine gun try to walk behind colonel son in the shadow if at all possible stay close behind him and when you two get close to general mah colonel son will start talking and you will then cover him just do nt overdo it said colonel son i have a sensitive back he laughed i blurted out i ca nt see how you can be so cheerful at a time like this colonel son shrugged his shoulders what else can i do he laughed again giving me a pat on the back
s screen trying to keep cool with tumblers of iced water and palm leaf fans i squatted on the top step panting inhaling the heated tar poured yesterday to lay the dust in the road want a cold drink we got in the icebox a bottle cream soda and a bottle beer papa said sam likes better beer we got plums in the icebox i get for you the swing squeaked as mama made to rise sit i said i m not hungry by

then comes anti semitin chase him out comes here a poor man saves his neshoma nothing else with what did i come papa grumbled with two hands come to bed papa mama said you talk already foolish you compare yourself with an educated german doctor i sat on the top step smoking another cigarette sixth street had finally retired every house was dark even herman s up the street had doused its upstairs bulb a gray cat without a collar nosed my shoes an old ford rattled past spraying tarry pebbles the car was jammed with youngsters popping cap pistols they yelled ikey kikey or maybe i imagined it the courthouse clock struck ten i pulled myself up climbed the stairs in the oven of our house stripped and took a cold shower drying i caught mirror a narrow face dark nearsighted eyes that held a trace of melancholy a bristly jaw not more not less than average chinless wonder what gives walter the right to insult me a bank account a house in brookfield heights a job to offer come off it sam do nt start getting hypersensitive that s the jew disease i turned on my fan crawled naked into bed expecting hoping i could quickly fall asleep seven o clock i had to be at work barry would be snottier than usual if i came in late the morning after a holiday the room was a sweatbox our attic was nt insulated all day the sun had baked the roof my fan made a racket needed oiling or a screw was loose i got up switched it off went back to bed i smelled smoke where there s smoke usually there s fire i rolled off the mattress opened draft i sniffed the upper hall nothing was burning on our premises i crawled back to bed and tossed i counted eleven strokes of the courthouse clock i heard roman candles hissing cannon crackers sputtering cap pistols rat tat tat down to the wire grady s mills was celebrating independence day and enough already please any moment any second it will be the fifth and any minute any second the temperature will drop it must the main thing is to stop thinking tell me how you ca nt switch off a brain the way you do a fan what walter and i had talked about kept my brain spinning it could change my life and none too soon it might even change the world and in this year of change was overdue for the better i mean walter s plan made sense it might lead to bigger things a pebble tossed into a pond sends its ripples far i kept smelling smoke i got up again to sniff the hall must be the tar i m smelling or the firecrackers i switched the fan on once more the grinding racket bothered me and that smell of smoke the third time i climbed out of bed i caught an orange glow reflected on my propped up window pane and when i leaned across the sill i saw flames up the street i ran downstairs to the phone shouted to the operator fire weiss s building one oh three sixth street leaped upstairs yanked on my pajama bottoms the alarm siren was wailing while i ran without glasses barefoot tar sticking to my soles up the street toward the grocery at an upstairs window i saw a white shadow maybe herman maybe myopic distortion then gray smoke billowed past the window and all i saw was smoke and tongues of bright red flame licking the parched side walls and the porch of herman s grocery a the hill at the hydrant on the corner firemen sweated swore connecting the hose the pressure was low just a trickle ran hurry crissake hurry i begged a man s trapped in there jack jones the fire chief a brave man dashed across the burning porch and drove his axe into the staircase door splintering it open dense smoke rolling down forced him back but i d seen herman
up and she looked at him with both a child s hurt and an old woman s severity i do nt need a rest she said things are nt getting too much for me he started to protest but instead his impatience with her getting the better of him he jumped up and strode across to the small kerosene stove on its table on the other side of the room she had only just started the preparations for the coffee when he entered and he noisily completed them her and his tight shoulders shutting her out when it was done he brought a cup of the coffee over to her his face as he held it out was somber and closed and when she sought his eyes wanting to express her remorse to make apology she found them veiled distant i suspect you re thinking you were right after all and it was nt such a good idea to bring me along she spoke after a long silence he made no answer only sat frowning down into the small black pool of coffee in his cup which he held cradled between his palms as if he needed its reassuring warmth how was the house raising she spoke after another silence his head remained bent a little longer over the cup and then he said hard work but fun and very beautiful in a way the house is only one room scarcely bigger than a closet but a house nonetheless the man to whom it stinger was years accumulating the money just to buy the lumber the next thing he s planning to do now that it s up is to get married he s been going with a woman from drake hill who has a couple of kids for him and they ll be getting married now that s slightly the reverse of things is nt it she said with a cautious laugh first having your family and then getting married i guess he said but in bournehills a man does nt believe in making it legal until he can at least offer his wife a house of her own no matter how small it s their way and as valid in the final analysis as any other he paused a slow smile taking shape you should have seen cox he was so happy poor guy especially when he saw the roof going up that he drank too much and passed out on us we then the smile giving way to the subtle sadness and irony that was so much a part of him he said musing it aloud it s so little for a man to ask of life a closet of a house that ll start falling apart on him in no time yet it s the world to someone here so that things being relative cox could see himself as a man who had succeeded at his life and he did at least for the time the house was going up i saw it in his face and i m afraid i also got a little drunk as a result oh hatt he said his tone his smile setting all to rights between them again i know i shall probably fall victim again to my emotions and get too involved a defect i m known for but i m beginning to feel so at home here in bournehills it s as though i ve lived in the harriet heard this not without a twinge of resentment she was helpless to suppress and i so love you she said after having looked for weeks vere at last found the car he wanted it was a much used but fairly late model opel kapitan the car made by the general motors subsidiary in germany which combines features drawn from both countries on one hand a high powered german motor on the other a long sleek low slung american body that in motion going very fast looks like some powerful animal leaping forward to strike it was the body perhaps more than anything else that decided vere the opel had been badly damaged in an accident and with its crumpled fenders and generally battered hull looked fit only for the scrap heap but vere his head cocked thoughtfully to one side examined it with an expert s eye he tried the motor sitting tensed forward over the steering wheel listening to it as he fed it the gas nod and purchased it on the spot he brought it like a bride home to bournehills with allen behind in the ford giving him an assist on the upgrades and nudging him into motion whenever the motor failed he gently coaxed the opel over the hills to spiretown and finally down the low embankment into the yard adjoining leesy s house near wreck that it was it immediately became part of the ancient wreckage in the yard including the ragged mango and calabash trees the torn galvanized fence the wattle and daub pen that housed the sow leesy was planning to have butchered at carnival and the ramshackle cart she used for haulingpher canes to the factory it was instantly at home with the bad tempered fowls who fought each other over the scraps tossed them from the doorway and the donkey standing abject and morose near the cactus bush where the wash was hung to dry the day vere brought the opel home the donkey had slowly raised its head and its blank eyes filled with the sunlight its deep sucking groans that were like sounds uttered during some protracted and painful coitus the cry ended it had resumed its pose of profound dejection and never again acknowledged the car nor did leesy ever really acknowledge it she never went near it but would move about the yard at her chores as if unaware of its presence during the day when she came to the doorway to check the sun or
this door and tried to ambush me and i told you watch out how you talk i do nt believe a goddam word you say tuttle shouted and blew a spray of saliva in ferguson s eyes that s what i think of what you say why you little prick ferguson reached for his gun but before he could get it out of the holster tuttle brought the butt of his machine gun doubled over tuttle dropped the machine gun and jumped on ferguson and the two men toppled to the ground and rolled in the dust each trying for a firm grip on the the four enlisted men two of them with their hands full of by now exhausted chickens watched in stunned silence the spectacle of two officers fighting in the dust they had heard officers snap at each other before and make remarks behind each other s backs but they had never seen them come to blows such a thing was one of the cardinal sins of the rule book and in his wildest dreams nobody had ever expected to see it happen they watched now part fascinated and part embarrassed and finally stackpole said i suppose we ought to break it up let s see who starts to win bromley suggested if ferguson starts then we break it up if tuttle starts let him do it all right said stackpole ll take mr tuttle lamb said i think he s gone out of his mind stackpole glanced down at the grunting officers and saw that tuttle who was younger than ferguson and had kept himself in better condition had secured possession of the and was trying to bring it around into ferguson s face stackpole leaned over and said do nt shoot him mr tuttle better hit him with it on the side of the head that way you wo nt be up on a murder rap oh lordy bromley said suddenly in a high voice knock it off sirs here comes the captain when evers reached the shore after leaving pablo tied to a tree he sat down for a moment to catch his breath and to try to figure out what was happening there had been sporadic bursts of firing but he could nt tell who was doing it or where the shots came from men from the icarus or both god alone knew what was going on or who the green clad men were or what they were up to the only thing that was certain was that the day was likely to end in a free for all if something was nt done to reverse the trend when he d sent his men off to forage he had apparently pulled the stopper on a bottle containing a djinn of monumental proportions one that was still seeping out and covering the island like marsh gas everything was going wrong and the possibilities of complete disaster were multiplied by the arrival of the guerrillas if that s what they were who were on some mission of their own he tried to think what the olive green fatigues signified and all he could remember were newspaper accounts of uniformed venezuelan guerrillas who called themselves the armed forces of national liberation and who raided villages for arms and ammunition and supplies it seemed unlikely that venezuelans would be on this island and besides cuban trained troops who well the hell with it they probably tied in with grimond who himself was enough of an enigma the only thing that stood out clearly was that nothing good was likely to happen with that fact accepted he could try not to be surprised by anything and try not to panic his first surprise came as he headed toward the settlement in the grass to the side of the path ahead he saw something dark and long it looked at first like a log but then he knew it was nt a log because he saw the sole of a foot grey and dirty and wrinkled and as he got closer he saw a hand then he saw the whole body and it was the old man whose chickens had been taken his eyes were flat and muddy and there were several red holes in him and a line of ants was crawling slowly up his chin and into his mouth the gun he and evers picked it up and slung it on his shoulder alongside pablo s gun he stared dumbly at the body thinking he should bury it but not having anything to dig with and he was still staring in a state of suspended animation when he heard shots coming from the distance ahead these were not machine gun shots they were more widely spaced and first there were two followed by four more this probably meant ferguson and his but by this time evers had resigned himself to the fact that everybody was going to be shooting and he remembered his resolve not to panic all right he thought so ferguson s finally got around to using his weapon i d have figured him to have been among the first but it does nt really matter when he does it it s what he s shooting at that counts so i guess the next thing is to find out what that is we can take care of the old man later mood of resignation interested him and he wondered why he should be detached when things were going to hell so much faster than he d feared i guess it s just that i ve imposed sanity over emotion he thought i m in the enviable position of being able to look at things rationally and not get upset it s a nice trick when you can do it he slung one gun on each shoulder and feeling something like a guerrilla himself started off for the settlement the cluster of metal and tarpaper shacks
drew in deeply on a cigarette i kept my eyes off her chest there are howie i mean the doctor came in a little while and i was glad he examined all of izzie s cuts and swellings put his arm in a sling and told him to come to the office the next day for x rays when he left izzie and i went into his room together and miriam left us alone the whole time the doctor had been there izzie had seemed cocky as soon as he got into his room though he collapsed just sort of folding and dropping to the floor i lifted him to his chair and he opened his eyes halfway he was shivering and i threw a blanket over his shoulders should i call the doctor again i asked or get miriam he shook his head from side to side he seemed totally sober now and he gave me a long look as if he were trying to tell me he could nt figure out why it had turned out this way either i got covers and then i left you try to sleep i said maybe i ll stop by in a few days mr goldstein was on critical for a week and then he began to improve he did nt come back to school though i got a graduation card from him that june izzie returned to classes about a week and a half later and to my surprise nobody paid much attention to him we were all too busy worrying about the playoffs and which colleges we would be going to events passed pretty quickly in those days izzie got a state scholarship and was supposed to go to columbia the next fall but when i was home for thanksgiving during my first year at college my mother told me that he d dropped out of school and was living at home the next time i saw him was at the end of my first year of college i d driven home with some guys who were on the freshman team with me to show them around i d improved during my first year of college and i did nt have much trouble with the erasmus players there were some other guys at the schoolyard who played college ball and i could hold my own with them too i d developed a good outside shot and it surprised a lot of the guys who d known me at erasmus my friends and i played a few games and then we started to leave hey howie you see your friend izzie lately one of the erasmus players asked no there he is did nt you notice he s a real star now the guy laughed and i looked where he d pointed on the other side of the wire fence at the far end of the playground i could see a bunch of grade school kids playing basketball i had to squint at first then i recognized him he was playing with a group of little kids some of them were one thing you got ta admit he s got the best set shot of all of em everybody laughed the child had not been wanted he said they could nt afford it yet she said they had nt done all the things they had planned to do they thought during the second month of giving up the child but decided against it they agreed that she would continue to teach until the seventh month and they told each other that they would love the child anyway that somehow things would work out as the months went by and the child began to grow inside her helen changed not only did she begin to forget about the many things they had hoped to do while still not burdened with children but she found that she was beginning to look forward to becoming a mother maybe it was best this way honey gary would say at night when they lay in bed together maybe we were only years slip by inventing excuses if this had nt happened to us after spending an evening with their friends they would take pleasure almost secretly it seemed from comparing themselves to those married couples who were still without children from noting how the child was drawing them closer to one another she wrote to her family and to his and they received long letters of congratulations and sizable checks from both sets of parents they were amazed they told each other at how easily they could accept the gifts without feelings of guilt of obligation helen delighted in her third grade children as she had never done before and he became more optimistic about their financial situation several times a week he would sit down on the living room couch with her and he would go over the figures showing her with pencil and paper that even if she did nt return to teaching for three years everything would be all right she praised him for his ability to arrange things what pleased them most though was feeling the baby listening to it he would lie with his ear pressed gently to her stomach and every time he heard a sound they would experience a thrill which seemed magical i think i m falling in love with you all over again she said to him it s so strange she had never seemed more beautiful to him and he had never loved her more they had never he felt been this close still as the months went by he became increasingly uneasy in particular he was afraid of what would happen to her were something to go wrong he called her doctor and the doctor told him not to worry he did anyway helen did nt he saw and this worried him even more while she was making supper one evening he leafed through

made me very concerned but of course it is the nature of my work i am at one place for a while and then as edith would say something happens and my services are no longer required it s a rootless existence and it has been brought home to me since i came to langmouth first when i had to leave anna and now at far the secret womantoo fond of this castle i like its thick walls and the fact that it s a fake endears me to it in a way i think i should have liked sir edward what a pity he died before i came i have seen his son rex several times we seem to meet frequently more frequently than could be put down to chance i am enormously interested in him and long to know about his childhood when valerie stretton was his nurse and what he thought of his half brother redvers i wish the captain would come home i am sure my poor patient would be happier if he did and it would be interesting to see how they all get on together may th last night i was with my patient when she was coming out of her sedation tier name is monique such a dignified name does not really suit her i picture her lying on sandy beaches under palm trees gazing out at the coral reefs about the island i picture her meeting the captain who would have perhaps gone to this coralle to pick up copra and fish or something like that to take back to sydney i imagined her with exotic red flowers in her hair he was captivated surely and foolishly for he married her without thinking how she would fit into castle crediton society but this was pure imagination it probably happened quite differently as i sat beside her she started to mutter i heard her say red why red you do nt love me quite revealing for it shows that he is constantly in her thoughts suddenly she said are you there nurse yes i soothed try to rest it s what the doctor wants she closed her eyes obediently she was really beautiful rather like a doll with her thick black hair and long dark lashes her skin looked honey yellow against the white of her nightdress her brow was low could nt have been more than twenty five now she was murmuring to herself and i bent over to listen he does not want to come back she said he wishes it had not happened he wishes to be free the castle well madam i thought i do nt wonder at it if you get into tempers like you did a short while ago she was wild passionate and uncontrolled what would lady crediton think of such a creature one thing she would be pleased about if one of the brothers had to make such a faux pas at least it was nt her precious son i could imagine her fury if the important rex made a mesalliance what would she do had she the power to do anything no doubt she had an interest in the company she would most certainly be a very important shareholder there were so many interesting things to be learned in the castle more interesting in fact than the matrimonial troubles of this pretty little fish out of water whom i had come to nurse may th i heard today that the captain is on his way home and should arrive in four weeks time it was edward who told me we have become friends i must say i find him a bright little fellow and i pity him left to the care of the prim miss beddoes she is the most unimaginative woman imaginable and edward is really rather a naughty little boy where she is concerned the other day she brought him in from his walk in the grounds dripping with water he had decided to take a bath fully dressed in the fountain he said she was quite distracted and he only laughed when she scolded him it is her own fault in a way she is so lacking in confidencethat the shrewd child senses this and makes the most of it he knows that he has to do what i tell him or go but i suppose it is easy for me as i am not in control of him he quite clearly charge of his mamma in the same way as poor miss beddoes is in charge of him and to be in authority over a grown up person makes me very important in his eyes he comes into his mother s room and watches me give her medicine i have a little kitchen where i prepare her food and he watches me do that he likes to have what he calls tasters from mamma s plate miss beddoes frowns on this she says it is eating between his meals and spoils his appetite and as in the case of most young people the more this is forbidden the more it is to his taste he is a lonely little boy in some respects he is so the secret woman small the castle is so big and his mother has no idea how to treat a child sometimes she spoils him and wants to fondle him at others she loses her temper with him and has no time for him he is not fond of her i can see of lady crediton but he is fond of grandmamma stretton and goes to see her every day but jane wo nt let him stay long because she said he tires her mistress it s small wonder that he has become attached to me i am i suppose predictable my attitude is unchanging i never fuss over him in fact i take little notice of him but we like each other so he
john punctuated by an electrified voice crackling into our sylvan aerie get out of the bushes what who is it john wheeled petrified from my ashbury pad i hear the command two and three times a day emanating from a police car winding up through the park rousting the faggots i explained this to john as the cruiser rolled slowly into the parking lot red cyclops eye revolving winking the hippies scurried into the undergrowth both cops what are you doing john cleared his throat i thought so that s what a death rattle sounds like and mumbled he must have been really terrified for he rarely employs the hip argot and this was a most inopportune time to do so just digging the moon man the younger and slenderer of the two cops walked gingerly around the scope and tripod as if it were a red chinese artillery piece the electric cotillion you re what just dig we re members of the san francisco amateur astronomersassociation officer we often use this park as an observationpoint in tuxedos there was an association dinner tonight i never tell a cop i m a musician not in this town the inference is unemployed itinerant dope fiend the paunchy older cop nudged the six pack with his toe stars re gon na look pretty fuzzy tonight two unemployed musicians john warneke police late last night atop buena vista park in a virtually insensate condition surrounded by a litter of empty beer cans whisky bottles and what were alleged to be marijuana butts or roaches also found on the person of davey were several empty plastic vials the two men with no known addresses were taken to san francisco general hospital for examination just trying to keep the chill out of our bones i said lightly inadvisedly with cold beer let s see your identification we produced driver s licenses i could tell they were being cautious because of our tuxes the wrinkles probably did nt show but our immaculate white shirts positively glowed in the winking rose light possibly they were envisioning castigation by chief cahill in the morning you prize goddam clowns all you did was roust the assistant provost and vice president of stanford university drinking s not allowed in the park the younger cop said returning our licenses then i think i said both officers expressed accord with the decision i helped john dismantle the scope and we went our separate ways as i descended the narrow winding macadam the electric cotillion noting bemused the yellow flower the hippies had affixed to my aerial i thought jesus what s this town coming to purportedly the last bastion of civilization in america and you ca nt even dig the moon in peace rousted like a couple of garden variety faggots following behind me like a vilifying reflection of my fall from grace the renewed stentorian voice of officialdom get out of the bushes i got home at quarter to three a i s plus concentration of booze in my veins inexplicably sober but feeling sixty years old the accumulated fatigue of two decades of abuse and struggle and bad pianos and malodorous dives and chop suey tunes weighting my bones tiptoed along my vestibule past pope s bedroom door silence within no crack of light gingerly checking the old man and moments later came bolt upright as a volcanic eruption of rock crashed the walls i ca nt get no oh satisfaction chapter late saturday morning i ran into dick dodo on mailbox row an infrequent concurrence good morning morning my wife and i enjoy your playing i should think an hour or two of scales would drive you up the wall odd he did nt look like a bircher sandy haired mild blue eyes thirty fivish a small sharp nose and generally weak features the smile shy and boyish but then i suppose neither do i look like a rhode island jew not at all the piece you were working on this morning we thought most interesting this morning i was nt playing this morning i m certain it was you something quite modern marjorie even remarked that it sounded distinctly he cleared his throat to dislodge the sticky alien phrase avant garde had a weird concept of the avant garde or shriveled cochlear cells that was my neighbor miss jarman cleaning the keys with a damp cloth i blurted grinning freely at him straining to keep from busting up completely and immediately was seized with remorse as i saw the color deepen on his narrow face and neck down to the collar of his kelly green sport shirt but why do people try to put labels on something they know nothing about it s getting harder and harder to tell these the electric cotillion days i eased him off the hook lifting a hefty package for pope from utah is nt that strange we thought it sounded of course that sort of music is nt our for god s sake do nt say bag the poor cluck finally trailed off still flushed to the ears and swiftly changed tack getting rather unpleasant down below he nodded in the direction of haight i shifted the utah parcel to i feel somewhat vulner able why vulnerable he was smiling again searching my face for some evidence that he was nt addressing a cretin the darkies and others they re moving up the hill i defy you to find me a dark hippie the sunny smile clouded fleetingly a beat s sweep of shadow as he doubled back gears grinding audibly the new young girl plays her phonograph rather loudly that she does and i m in the process of putting a stop to it i smiled reassuringly and waved off a familiar dulcet sound emanating from the rear of my pad as i came back in pope had put fantasy li on the phono she knew i had recorded but i
s like a jail without walls but with peepholes in it or one giant peephole the voice had gone weak again at the end it was remindful of a sigh over forgotten regrets are you sure you re all right mrs ross mrs ross might not have heard i she went on it marches you know always marches or charges you can hear it before it arrives it gathers strength on the far butte from the ranch house and then howls along like an invader like a troop of them it s good you ve decided to pay no attention more coffee if it is nt men marching it s horses charging they re all of them stallions it seemed to may hearing and watching this thin troubled woman this woman too soon grown old that the wind had dried up all her juices leaving a dead reed of a body a papery voice and an erratic mind stallions she said without purpose always stallions jay likes to watch them you know when she did nt finish having come as close to the fact as any lady should come it occurred to may of a sudden that perhaps it was nt altogether the wind and be dried and men did nt invade or stallions charge unless fear or distaste populated the winds poor woman she thought and yes even poor jay who by her guess and by whispered report had more than enough appetite poor both of them we had a name in upper new york mrs ross was saying we still have my family why you have a name here mrs ross was a long time in answering yes she said finally yes jay has she got up with her frail dry dignity i must go now thank you for the coffee carefully she put on the hat and veil may brought her care fully her gloves at the door she said good bye mrs collingsworth god bless you good bye i m leaving tomorrow leaving for good mrs ross turned away as if not wanting for home the girls will join me i m so sorry oh mrs ross i ll miss you good bye with nice old precision without looking back mrs ross went down the walk phere at the mouth of the canyon the breast river washed gravel already shining it ran from bend to bend and at the bends tarried green blue and inviting in the late afternoon light its surface caught the colors of sunset collingsworth hitched the home fashioned creel on his shoulder and walked on toward a turn casting his artificial lure idly in the shallows where no trout were likely to lie one more hole he thought and he would have plenty of fish not alone for himself but for old charlie blackman and his companion he had met charlie upstream on the shore standing gawky as a blue heron he held an open topped five gallon kerosene can with a haywire handle how perfessor he had said grinning hello me and my pardner is gophering up there on the ridge he thumbed back toward the place with his free hand might get jackass lucky gold s where you find it ai nt that the sayin gold for heaven s sake yep but it s dry work for wettin our whistles we got to come to the crick how s fishin perfessor good so far i ll bring you a mess if you want it blackman pushed his can in the creek filled it and lifted it with an ease surprising in so old a man any day but friday which today ai nt blackman grinned again showing some teeth i got scruples against fish on friday collingsworth had said good bye and walked on when he looked back he saw blackman lugging the full can up the hill there was no hurry he sat down on a dead log and over it the shapes and colors of sundown plain then distortedby the fancies of water like men water had to go somewhere yet the stream would remain new water introducing itself to old rocks old driftwood old twists and turns and quarreling and chuckling to itself at discovery old discoveries could nt be reported upstream he saw the old horse again stirred to the thought of it he realized by one of those frail and distracting connections that too often made thinking random it had trotted out sway backed and big headed from the shade of old sorenson s deserted homesteader shack as he was about to pass in his buggy the shack was of tarpaper now mostly blown off its two windows were blank glass and frames taken by someone with use for them whatever there had been in the way of a barn had been torn down for firewood or planking the old horse remained collingsworth imagined he knew what had happened the sorensons had packed up and moved taking the few animals still of use or of value but there was old buck or old blue or old bess too old for service too dear for death and so they had left it the horse had followed along for a mile its heavy feet lifting slower and slower and then had stopped and turned back and plodded home from somewhere now crows were yelling against the turn of the day a nutcracker scratched the air and close at hand a water ouzel fresh as creation tried current and stone and seemed pleased with both as well as itself out of water from fish to bird elephant ear butte was shaded save at its very top where the sun said good bye to it or promised return it stood lonely and eternal itself a promise of constancy sunrise or not storm time and tide or not a man felt drawn to it felt embraced by a flowing foreverness felt mortal and reassured dying he would know down toward the
rain leading and tugging the horse through mud on a road that seemed to have vanished and indeed did so before far after nightfall he sneaked up the village street and beyond it to a house where he waited rain or no rain a long time to knock and wake the servants feeling without having to see his wet ruff and cuffs limp and sad his hat shapeless as an oyster muddy as a pig farmer all soaked to the bone one last lost survivor of the armada ready finally to rap on the a tallow candle yellow in its horn lantern unblinkingin spite of the gasps which greeted him i should have been here in time for supper but i was set upon by a half dozen idle rogues armed with cudgels lord god are you hurt a few bruises no matter no matter one of these gypsies had a pistol and he pointed it straight at my heart but rain had ruined the fellow s powder he could nt make flash or fire so i skewered him clean with my sword danced him like a chunk of mutton on a spit and left him to feed kites if a man points pistol at me and aims to kill he must pay the price and the others well now when they saw this gypsy go to god they dropped sticks and took off like a flock of bleating sheep haloo says i i may be late for supper but damn ran them for miles clean out of the county and i doubt they ve caught their wind yet laughs and laughs until the old servant chuckles too a pause well are you finished sir what do you mean by that only sir if it pleases you i was thinking if you had done with your tale you might like to come in out of the rain no not that man who changed with the times without ever changing ask him and he ll define mutability without hesitation why t is the wiggling of fingers and wagging of hands whereby the deaf and dumb make chatter with each other take instead the other the ageless young man take him as young and unlined save when he raises an eyebrow or the laughing edges of his eyes the corners of his lips forever unchanging and unfading he is the child of him all that the changing world and court could ever know burning with change his nature like the nature of flame restless ever swaying and dancing dying down to flare up again with least encouragement of air if he is one man he is also many as all the cards together make a deck and in that bunch every card s a one eyed knave voice of our disgruntled discarded country gentleman still outraged listen he calls out i know the fellow well or else his twin brother i sat at table playing cards with him played at spanish primero and honest english trump played gleek and maw post and pair and pope july and never won so much as a clipped coin oft him those young peacocks had rings upon their fingers with mirrors set amongst the jewels console yourself sir the young man replies think far from court far from care think in restored country wisdom to a cloister who wishes to go from thence to heaven damn you sir the other voice fading answering from safety of distance an ape is still an ape though he be clad in purple to which sir in the same spirit permit me to reply you can not make a whistle out of a pig s tail be content and remember before you spurn that well fed village widow there is a virtue which poverty can not destroy go to and be content you are out of the rain you are eating bread and cheese and drinking the widow s cider from a stout wooden cup and if the woman will believe half your tales why you may yet be named the best liar in england there is no further answer from the other the young man turns to best advantage to the light to speak for himself a poor country bumpkin with little money and less charm though perhaps with a some godforsaken village in a distant county where none of us knows anyone or wishes to some fellow whose grandfather was knighted by a dead king in a moment of drunkenness or fever and on that alone came bouncing into court to make his fortune to play the bright angel who tripped over the ledge of heaven and fell ass over joint stool down to common earth pity is wasted on the man he is a sheep fit for an age of sheep and sheep are single minded animals solemn and stupid beyond believing the last frisk of life goes out of them when they cease to he called lambs their happiest destiny is to be a joint of cold mutton in an alehouse believe mc i have no compassion for those fellows the worst are insufferable impudent rogues the best are bodies to fill a chamber or swell a progress and each and every one is a clown of course the more the merrier we plucked them feathers and all home without them one might have been sore pressed at times for money and amusement i recall one solemn fellow fat as a pig and not half so fastidious who besought us with most touching simplicity to teach him the ways and manners of the court and how to advance himself we laughed and were about to begin his education with the art of throwing dice when harrington sir john the queen s godson and a most amusing fellow really harrington stopped us before we had begun no no quoth harrington you idle ignorant lascivious negligent parasitical popinjays have forgotten the first principle of the gospel according to
in the telephone booth at the rear of the nearly deserted out of the darkness of a movie house flashing out of the confused splotches of color and light that made up the screen s images like the underside of a dream forcing its way to the surface of the mind pafter the movie was over he took carla for a walk she liked to walk through the university jesse took her out washtenaw for several blocks to the apartment building where cady lived carla was in a good mood she had enjoyed the movie she looked so small so docile that she could have been jesse s own daughter in spite of her thin strained face he was proud of being with her someone might mistake him for her father a father of a child a father carla chattered about the movie but jesse remembered only looming men expressionless men vast colored skies and horizons the promise of eternal desert mountains that looked like perfunctorylimitations of the earth the earth as it is imagined needing an end he monumental thud of stampeding cattle forces pounding in one direction and then back in the other back and forth a tornado of the mind a spiral dipping out of the sky it was the old testament all that activity and he was absurdly abruptly grateful for the movies which he saw so rarely for their progress in patches and spurts not as a coherent story but as the jagged bits of a story that never quite added itself up to anything believable years ago his freshman english instructor at the university had told him there was something odd about his understanding of literature he was unable to follow a plot he was unable to see the careful evolution of a story the necessary pattern the rhythm that demanded completion the internal heat the gravity that forced everything to a suitable conclusion what did all these things mean he had not understood though he had tried but in the end he did not know what a what people thought were stories were fragments from shattered wholes the patterns the brain waves of a certain man at a certain time in his life the record of his controlled and uncontrolled inner life therefore all writing was autobiography was nt it his instructor an earnest young new yorker had tried to explain what was wrong with jesse s ideas or his temperament maybe he did nt have a literary temperament but jesse still believed that all writing was factual and true as part of a shattered whole that could not be put back together again but must be experienced only in parts and yet was not believable in the way his medical texts were believable you lived it but you could not believe it he was struck by a sense of shyness as he entered the cadys apartment building it was fairly small four stories high made of stone that was weathered and stained covered partly with ivy with the appearance of a still moist air that had the quality of secrecy sternness an elevator with an elaborate iron grillwork that put jesse dizzily in mind of a fortress there was a stern secretive spirit here and a variety of styles the curlicues of the grillwork brass knobs small heraldic beasts at the molding nearly lost in shadow and dust an aged but very respectable wallpaper that showed silvery leaflife designs absolutely flat motionless unlike the turbulent screen of the movie house jesse had just been in carla tugged at his arm and whined about going home was nt it time to go home what were they doing here the cadys apartment was on the first floor so he did not have to take the elevator carla would probably have refused to get into it he found the door without any trouble bent to spruce up carla hid his own nervousness he rang the doorbell and cady s daughter answered the door almost immediately it happened so quickly dr cady he is nt home right now oh he is nt home she did not reply looking from him to carla and back again when do you think he ll be home i do nt know jesse smiled nervously i wanted to say good by before he left i wanted this is a little friend of mine carla spewak you probably do nt remember me my name is jesse vogel she nodded but so quickly and vaguely that jesse could not tell if she had remembered his face went hot with disappointment yes i ll tell father you stopped by i m sorry to disturb you it s all right was i disturbing you are you busy i wonder if i could talk to you for a minute jesse said she hesitated i do nt want to take up your time but i d like to talk to you for a minute jesse said cady s daughter did not quite meet his eye the skin of her forehead seemed to tighten as if with dread or expectation jesse found himself staring at the dead white part in the center of her head her black hair had been brushed back on either side of this part starkly and smoothly but in front of her ears there were filmy tendrils of hair not thick enough to be curls her face was pale and clear no make up no lipstick a face denuded of guile no tricks there no bright false surges of enthusiasm of the kind he got from other girls and that had disturbed him so in anne marie he wanted only the truth from women he wanted their true faces he did not care about beauty jesse told himself as he stared at this young woman who was not beautiful but who seemed to and possessed instead that stern doubtful face she smiled suddenly a courteous smile exactly like her father s yes please come
was an exquisite miniature ballroom the walls lined with mirrors and when handworthy wound up the movement and released the catch two groups of tiny dancers began to waltz toward each other their images were caught up and multiplied a hundredfold in the mirrors of a harp were plucked below in the gray enameled case before manny could comment he was whisked over to a superbly crafted wooden figure of a charming child a painted smile wreathing the gently carved mouth the child was seated on a mahogany stool and when the latching hook had been lowered it leaned forward and after dipping a feathered pen into an inkwell began to write in smooth cursive flow when she leaned back her motions apparently brought to a close manny bent forward and found to his intense amazement a beautifully crafted letter of some fifty words written to the mother of the child there were other amazing sights an android that fingered and breathed wind into a flute that played sweetly a reclining cleopatra that rose bowed gravely at the waist and then lay down once more upon her feathered couch since each of the treasured machines was in perfect functioning order manny rapidly lost interest and merely followed handworthy about nodding politely his mind distant upon he was jarred back to reality when with the reverence that one would use to lay bare a sleeping nymph handworthy removed the sheet from the huge centerpiece of the room it was a small segment of a vestern street complete with hitching post before which stood an uncannily life like figure of a town marshal complete with vest and badge chaps and holstered gun the painted face was scowling and from closer scrutiny it was apparent that the figure was capable of complex motion the others said amos handworthy are marvelous antiques that i ve collected but this fellow was made to my own specifications in switzerland his clothing is quite authentic and he really works watch this he stepped forward and took a loosely draped gun belt off the hitching post to the right of the marshal and buckled it about his waist the device is electrically operated he continued the instant i draw the marshal draws too and the trick is to hit light that flashes out of my gun before he can get off his shot i can adjust the speed of his draw within fairly wide limits and i ve been moving him up to faster and faster speeds but i ve gotten pretty damn fast with a drawing motion that was almost a blur he whipped out his gun and pulled the trigger the marshal was fast but apparently not as fast for suddenly a recorded voice bellowed in pain and gasped you got me you dirty varmint a little touch of my own said amos handworthy that s what happens when i hit him he looked down at his gun almost proudly and manny had the eerie feeling that it was only with restraint that he did not blow the imaginary smoke away from the gun barrel that s a highly imaginative device said manny he is said amos handworthy but he s still not quite idea that you can make him the kind of opponent i need what do you want said manny all of his ennui was beginning to evaporate and the familiar exultant response to challenge had begun to grow in him i want him to be able to hit me too figuratively speaking said amos handworthy as things stand now this shootout is entirely one sided i d like to know for instance if he s been able to hit me i can do it said manny you ll have to get me off my regular project but i can do it i ll call your division chief in the morning said amos handworthy you ll stay here with me and you can have all the time you need manny did not sleep well in his spacious overly comfortable bed he was up early the following morning poring over the construction plans for the marshal and typical thoroughness had included in the neatly packed maintenance kit he caught the guiding concept of the design at once and made his plans to modify the marshal along lines that incorporated control techniques that were basically electronic he phoned the plant and requisitioned integrated circuits transistors metal film resistors capacitors and various other components necessary for his task handworthy did not approach him as he worked and his meals were served to him either in his own room or the great room where all the automata were located he made all the changes himself snipping leads soldering forming tight mechanical joints with deft fingers that almost seemed alive and apart from his body ten days later he called in amos handworthy and demonstrated what he had done i ve modified both guns so that you and the marshal will now shoot at each other with ultraviolet light you ll both wear vests that are sensitive to this light i monitor the hits electrically by measuring the resistance of those areas will occur unless you or the marshal are hit in such an area furthermore you can both continue to shoot for an indefinite length of time however i ve altered the marshal s aiming mechanism so that if he s hit in a vital spot he wo nt shoot as accurately similarly if you are hit a defocusing mechanism operates on your light bulb so that your gun is no longer as accurate and instead of the recorded

up at the house on a sunday when the parents were away visiting relatives it was december there was snow in the avenue and crusted onto the garden path other people were pale and pinched and francois looked tanned and fit he asked if he could speak to mademoiselle jacqueline she said c est moi meme and what did he want he replied he commanded the platoon in which one jean claude dumas private soldier had been killed and he bore a letter she asked him in the letter had been written some weeks before jean claude died and he had kept it in his inside pocket during the patrol in the djebel looking for a band of fellagha who had wiped out a settler family they had not found the guerrillas but had run into a battalion of the aln the trained troops of the algerian national movement the fln there had been a bitter skirmish in the half light of dawn and jean claude had taken a bullet through the lungs he jacqueline read the letter and cried a little it said nothing of the last weeks just chatter about the barracks at constantine the assault courses and the discipline the rest she learned from francois the pull back through the scrub for four miles while the outflanking aln closed in the repeated calls on the radio for air support and at eight o clock the arrival of the fighter bombers with their screaming engines and thundering rockets and how her brother who had volunteered for one of the toughest regiments to prove he was a man had died like one coughing blood over the knees of a corporal in the lee of a rock francois had been very gentle with her as a man he was hard as the earth of the colonial province in whose four years of war he had been forged as a professional soldier but he was very gentle with the sister of one of his platoon she liked him for that and accepted his offer to dine in paris besides she did not want them to hear how jean claude had died for both had managed to numb themselves to the loss in the intervening two months and somehow carry on as usual over dinner she swore the lieutenant to silence and he agreed but for her the curiosity became insatiable to know about the algerian war what really happened what it really stood for what the politicians were really playing at general de gaulle had come to the presidency from the premiership the previous january swept into the elysee on a tide of patriotic fervour as the man who would finish the war and still keep algeria french it was from francois that she first heard the man her father adored referred to as a traitor to france they spent francois s leave together she meeting him every evening after work in the salon to which she had gone in january o from the training school he told her of the betrayal of the french army of the paris government s secret negotiations with the imprisoned ahmed ben bella algeria to the melons he had returned to his war in the second half of january and she had snatched a brief time alone with him when he managed to get a week s leave in august in marseilles the day o f the j a c k a l anatomy of a plot she had waited for him building him in her private thoughts into the symbol of all that was good and clean and virile in french young manhood she had waited throughout the autumn and winter of with his picture on her bedside table throughout the day and evening pushed down her nightdress and clasped to her belly while she slept in his last leave of the spring of he had come again to paris and when they walked down the boulevards he in uniform she in her prettiest dress she thought he was the strongest broadest handsomest man in the city one of the other girls at work had seen them and the next day the salon was a buzz she was not there she had taken her annual holiday to be with him all the time francois was excited there was something in the wind the news of the talks with the fln was public knowledge the army the real army would not stand for it much longer he promised that algeria should remain french was for both of them the combat hardened twenty seven year old officer and the adoring twenty three year old mother to be an article of faith francois never knew about the baby he returned to algeria in march and on april several units of the french army mutinied against the metropolitan government the first colonial paras were in the mutiny almost to a man only a handful of conscripts scuttled out of barracks and made rendezvous at the prefet s office the professionals let them go fighting broke out between the mutineers and the loyal regiments within a week early in may francois was shot in a skirmish with a loyalist army unit jacqueline who had expected no letters from april july she quietly took a flat in a cheap suburb of paris and tried to gas herself she failed because the room had too many gas leaks but lost the baby her parents took her away with them for their august annual holidays and she seemed to have recovered by the time they returned in december she became an active underground worker for the oas her motives were simple francois and after him jean claude they should be avenged no matter by what means no matter what the cost to herself or anyone else apart from this passion she was without an ambition in the world her only complaint was that she could not do more than run errands carry messages occasionally a slab of
a baseball fan all right i lied the indians will win by two touchdowns that s not so good harlie we re the huns oh well then the huns by two touchdowns i just rechecked my figures auberson shook his head in confusion i think i ve just been out non sequitured probably you want to tell me what we re talking about the upcoming board meeting how about giving me a printout of the annual report the other with the real in fact let me have a printout of the books themselves both sets i might be able to find something in them that i can use in front of the board next week i m sure you can said harlie in fact i ll even point out some goodies for you good this is going to be a battle harlie no a confrontation we ca n t cop out do you want the psychiatric reports on the board members as well i have access to their confidential files auberson jerked to a stop huh he typed into the machine i wish you had n t told me that the temptation to look is irresistible there are some things i think you should see and there are one or two items which would be of great help in influencing certain recalcitrant individuals harlie i do n t like what you re suggesting i m sorry auberson but it s my g o d remember i am still a temporary project i must be aware of every weapon available to me in order to protect my existence harlie this is one weapon we must not use auberson thought hard remembered an editorial he had read once it had referred to another incident one that had occurred far away but it was applicable in every situation where a man was forced to consider the use of an immoral weapon he had thought the arguments cogent and valid then he still thought so now he typed the end does not justify the means the end shapes the means and if we resort to any kind of manipulation of persons instead of presenting our arguments logically and rationally and carrying on a rational discussion then we will have failed in our purpose to be more than just a naked ape he added thoughtfully if we use this weapon then we are voluntarily giving up the one thing that makes us better than them forget one thing harlie typed i am not human your arguments do not apply to me auberson stared at the words he swallowed hard and forced himself to the keyboard again harlie they do apply to you especially if you wish to function in a human society the machine hesitated i have no choice i am limited to this environment but i have every reason to try to change this environment into one that suits me better would you be happier in a world where logic is discounted in favor of manipulation i am already in such a world i am trying to improve upon it if i must use its weapons i will harlie auberson was thinking fast we must never never allow ourselves to be less than what we wish to be harlie was silent a moment at last he clattered out the information is there if you need it auberson it could provide an edge if a fight is worth fighting was backing off i do not want to see this information harlie yes man friend i understand but it is there if you need it harlie auberson said patiently i think it will be enough if we just rape loot pillage burn and kill we do n t have to kick them in the nuts too by friday auberson was beginning to think he had things under control again he had given up completely the idea of trying to explain the g o d machine to the board of directors and instead had decided to tell them only that harlie says it will work or it s in the specs you can check them yourself an unpromising plan to be sure and one that undoubtedly would not be successful on its own before a hostile board but auberson was well prepared to back up that claim with a variety of confirmations from the department heads of the corporation s four affected divisions only one minor matter it was a phone call from krofft early in the morning the physicist wanted to know if it would be possible to speak with harlie again at first auberson wanted to say no with the confusion of lastminute preparations for the board meeting on tuesday krofft would only be in the way and if one of the directors were to hear of auberson s minor breach of security in letting krofft have access to the human analogue robot life input equivalents it might prove extremely embarrassing especially with the g o d proposal hanging in the balance but the physicist seemed so imperative so urgent it was as if he was on the verge of something important and needed to confer with harlie to confirm it auberson at last gave in listen dr krofft he said do you have access to a computer with an auto dial phone link of course in fact i think most of our equipment was manufactured by your company god for the interlocking directorates for once they ve proven useful listen he fumbled through the papers on his desk looking for the company phone directory he found it and thumbed it open the autodial for our memory master is uh four six three dash one two eight oh punch that through and you can talk to harlie through your master computer right harlie s wired into it oh and do nt tell anyone this is just between you and me and harlie not too many people know yet of this capability of his but how
i ll resign a look of gratitude appeared on kelly s fleshy sweat shiny face jim i want you to understand that is well look here i asked you to come in with me when your party booted you out and do nt think i did nt get my wrist slapped for it but i did nt give a damn about the consequences and there were some i wanted you in this outfit and to hell with threats but this reanimation thing is too big it s got undertones and overtones that reach into every corner of society i do nt want to get associated with it in any way the risks scare me jim i see a real danger that this firm could be wiped out if there s trouble over your process and i a lifetime building i do nt need to tell you that a partnership like ours is vulnerable in a way that a corporation is nt a couple of hefty suits a few expensive contingencies they ve got us right down to our personal possessions jim there s no escaping it and so well it seemed to portobello and klein and me sure bill harker had a sudden dizzying vision of himself standing at the rim of a bottomless abyss getting ready to jump but he heard his voice calm rock steady saying i ll draft a note informing you that i m severing my connection with the firm because of the pressure of outside activities hoarsely kelly said thanks jim and if this thing blows over if it all works out the right way we ll have a spot for you here do nt forget that i wo nt not that kelly meant it harker it was just a formal ritualistic statement part of the proper procedure for letting a partner go this implication that he could always come back in some quieter future time he was through there probably he was through with private law practice forever kelly was a brave and intelligent man but even kelly had been afraid to keep the hot potato that was james harker on his letterhead any longer no one else was likely to welcome him beller labs was the only straw to which he could cling now he stood up okay bill i m glad we got everything taken care of so smoothly i ll clear out my office next week will that be okay no hurry about it whenever it s convenient for you oh nearly forgot kelly consulted a memo slip leo winstead s office phoned here for you earlier today the governor wants you to call him back between half past one and three this afternoon said thanks bill and so long he bought a noontime edition of the star post and ate a gloomy little meal by himself in a nineteenth floor automated restaurant overlooking the east river he pushed the meal selector buttons almost at random and out of the slots came a chaotic assortment of cheap synthetics but he hardly cared he ate mechanically paying no attention to the food as he shoveled it in what held his attention was the increasingly more dismaying news the paper offered there was a new statement from senator thurman more vehemently anti reanimation than the last evidently thurman did nt mind some injudicious prehearing publicity he seemed to be bubbling over with loathing for the beller process now he said reanimation is of dubious value in mitigating human sorrow a crude and unsatisfactory business that robs life of dignity and plunders the tomb of its repose that was in response to the story about the janson suicide and speaking of that yes the body had been found of page one wayne janson unmarried occupation given as investor death listed as suicide body identified by jonathan bryant investigation now proceeding as a result of bryant s statement that janson had recently been depressed in the aftermath of a beller reanimation david klaus was back in the news too with a manifesto clearly concocted by mitchison the janson case proves conclusively that the beller reanimation technique can be a dangerous and destructive instrument in the wrong hands we can only hope that it will be placed under proper control before further such tragedies can occur at half past one harker made his way to a public phone booth sealed himself in snapped on the privacy shield and rang for the operator when the robot voice asked what he wanted harker gave his credit card number and put through his call to albany a relay of secretaries at the governor s mansion passed him along in tortuous fashion until at last he reached leo winstead the definition was poor even so harker could see the fatigue on winstead s face new york s governor looked bleary eyed and tense harker said i got your message leo what goes have you seen the latest statement from thurman about reanimation of dubious value in mitigating human sorrow yes i saw it jesus leo i never thought the old man would carry on like this the hearing has nt even started and he s practically destroyed us already he s made a surprising lot of noise yes winstead said the governor looked like a man about to explode from centrifugal tensions in a tight strung voice he said jim we held a caucus on the thurman situation last night supposedly it was the state committee meeting but we had a lot of national headquarters people on the line too and first let me tell you that the state committee is going to issue and asking for careful consideration of reanimation with the hope that it ll be given congressional blessing and placed under regulated auspices as quickly as feasible harker smiled it s about time someone said he was on our side do nt congratulate yourselves too lustily winstead warned it took all night before we could agree on
he met no one she was still standing there something she must have done to herself while he was away had made her look to him as she had in the beginning women never looked too bad when they were waiting like that her for winter locking her thumbs in the coat s lapels she hung on she knew when not to say anything did she suspect he did nt have to leave what did she think of him more or less

trough the main table had been made into bobbling at him monkey eyed ass chinned kitty smooching diminishing down the room in one of those longshots cameramen took kneeling out of some nice a rated movie that had broken its guarantee not to turn into a dream the like some other animal than our brand they all looked like they knew their own ravages and were counting on a good boy like him to be

with and this is how i do it i suppose i ve received hundreds of such bonuses usually i give them to friends or as gifts at christmas to doormen and other loosely connected personnel of the household but often i keep them of course i can afford to buy any of these things and i do i enjoy making purchases but somehow nothing brings the joy of existence home to me more than these premiums something from nothing the two suiter from chase manhattan and my own existence luggage a bonus and life a bonus too like havingpa film star next to you on your flight from the coast there are treats of high order adventure like cash in the street let s enjoy ourselves i say let s have fun lord let us live in the sand by the surf of the sea and play till cows come home we ll have a house on the vineyard

the occasion of our best possibilities and our humanness be bullish too speaking personally i am glad to be a heroic man i am pleased that i am attractive to women but grateful i m no bounder love with me as frequently they do i am rarely to blame i never encourage these fits and do my best to get them over their derangements so as not to lose the friendships of their husbands when they are known to me or the neutral friendship of the ladies themselves this happens less than you might think however for whenever i am a houseguest of a married friend i usually make it a point to bring along a girl these girls are from all walks of life models show girls starlets actresses tennis professionals singers heiresses and the daughters of the diplomats of most of the nations of the free world all walks they tend however to conform to a single physical type and are almost always tall tan slender and blond the girl from ipanemaas a wag friend of mine has it they are always sensitive and intelligent and good at sailing and the australian crawl they are never blemished in any way for of a thigh or above the shoulder blade is enough to put me off and their breaths must be as sweet at three in the morning as they are at noon i never see a woman who is dieting for diet sours the breath arm hair of course is repellent to me though a soft blond down is now and then acceptable i know i sound a prig i m not i am well classical drawn by perfection as to some magnetic platonic pole idealism and beauty s true north but if i m demanding about the type i fall in love with i do fall in love i m not don juan i try to be charming to all women the flawed as well as the unflawed i know that times have changed and that less is expected of gentlemen these days that there s more openness between the sexes and that in the main this is a healthy development still in certain respects it and not only find myself incapable of strong language in the presence of a lady i rarely use it myself at any time even a damn even a hell but become enraged when someone else uses it and immediately want to call him out i m the same if there s a child about or a man over the age of fifty seven if he is not vigorous the leopard can not change his spots i m a gentleman an opener of doors and doffer of hats and after you firster meek in the elevator and kind to the help i maintain a fund which i use for the abortions of girls other men have gotten into trouble if the young lady prefers i have a heart to heart with the young man and although i ve no sisters i have a brother s temperament all good counsel and real concern even without a sister of my own or a brother either for that matter i m an only child sisses the moral forks still there s fun in me and danger too i m this orphan now but that s recent father and mother died early this year mother first and father a few days later father too was courteous topwomen and i m afraid that when they were alive i gave my

requested such a table and his position guaranteed it trevayne ordered a drink and let his memory wander back to his days in the state department they had been challenging exciting almost as stimulating as the early years with the companies primarily because few people believed he could accomplish the major assignment given him it had been to coordinate trade agreements with each country the most favor ale conditions possible without upsetting political balances it had nt been difficult ile remembered that at the very first conference he had disarmed both sides by suggesting that the u s state department and its communist counterpart hold an international press conference in ode room categorically rejecting everything the other side stood for while in the next room the businessmen negotiated their agreements the ploy had its effect the laughter had been sincere and the but set for future meetings whenever the negotiations got heated someone would playfully suggest that his adversary belonged in that other room with the propagandists i le had enjoyed his washington days there had been the exhilaration of knowing he was close to corridors of real power that his judgments were listened to by men of great commitments and they were linen of commitment regardless of their individual political affiliations mr trevayne mr webster trevayne stood up and shook the hand of the presidential assistant he a year or two younger a pleasant looking man sorry as hell to be late there was a flap over tomorrow s schedule the president told the four of us to lock ourselves in a room and not come out till we got it in order i gather that was accomplished trevayne sat down as webster did the same damned if i know webster laughed flagging a waiter i got you cleared for eleven fifteen and let the rest of them figure out the afternoon he gave his order and collapsed back into the chair sighing audibly what s a nice ohio farmboy like me doing in a job like this i d say it was a quite a leap it was i think they got the names mixed up my wife keeps telling me there s a guy named webster wandering around the streets of akron wondering why he spent all that money for campaign contributions it s possible appointment was no mistake he had been a bright young man who hurl risen rapidly in ohio state house politics credited with keeping the governorship in the president s column franklyn baldwin had told trevayne that webster was a man to watch did you have a good flight yes thanks much smoother than your afternoon i think i m sure of that the waiter returned with webster s drink the two men remained silent until he left have you talked with anyone but baldwin no i have nt frank suggested that i do nt the danforth people have no idea there was nt any point even if frank had nt cautioned me nothing s definite yet it is as far as we re concerned the president s delighted he ll tell you that himself there s still the senate hearing they may have different ideas on only thing they might spring on you is your favorable press in soviet publications my what they like you over at tass i was nt aware of it it does nt matter they like henry ford too and you were doing a job for state i have no intention of defending myself against something like that i said it does nt matter i would hope not however there is something else from my point of view i ve got to have certain well i guess you d call them understandings they ve got to be clear what do you mean basically two things i mentioned them to baldwin cooperation and no interference both are equally important to me i ca nt do the job without them i m not even sure i can do it with them without them impossible that s a condition anyone would make easily made difficult to get remember i worked in this town once i do nt follow you how could anyone interfere let s start with the word classified then jump to restricted along with which can be found secret top secret even priority oh hell you re cleared for all that i want it spelled out up front i insist on it then ask for it you ll get it unless you ve managed to fool everyone your dossier s a study in respectability they d let you carry around the little black box no thanks it can stay right where it is it will now i wanted to brief you on tomorrow robert webster spelled out the routine for a white house audience and trevayne realized arrival time half an hour to forty five minutes before admittance to the oval room the specific entrance to be used the pass supplied by webster the suggestion that trevayne carry no metallic objets larger than a key ring the realization that the meeting was restricted to just so many minutes and might well be cut short if the chief executivc had said what he wanted to say or heard what he wanted to hear if time could be saved it should be i revayne nodded his understanding and approval i heir business nearly finished webster ordered a second and anal drink i promised you on the phone a couple of explanations i m flattered you have nt pressed me for them they were nt important and i assumed the president would gilmer the one uppermost in my mind that being why he wants to see you tomorrow yes it s all related it s why you have my private number you ll be able to reach me anytime of day or night no matter where i am here or overseas is that necessary i m not sure but it s the

out behind her brushing objects in his room as she turned although he had been thinking of her all morning this seemed to be a different mary from the one in his thoughts clearer sharper more brightly colored she changed the air in his studio stirring up the center of it and making the corners look darker and dustier the room appeared to be hers now when she stepped back to look at the statue he had the feeling that that was hers too he imagined how efficiently she would make a statue motion or a single revision relying upon some rich lode of intuition that he did not possess when she was done she would give the statue a loving smack on the rump as if it were a child sent out to play after she had tied its shoelaces very nice she said now i like it she turned and kissed him she wound her arms around his neck he said i should get back to work mary but then when she was gone the other mary returned the silent floating one of his thoughts and the image of her writing to her mother in law continued to pain him so much that he sat on his stool bent over and clutching his chest like a man suffering a heart attack by early afternoon he had completed every last detail of the statue still he did nt leave the studio and when brian came visiting he heard his voice in the entrance hall he refused to see him called jeremy did nt answer then brian s boots mounted the stairs two steps at a time his great hearty knock sounded on jeremy s door hey in there you feel like a visitor jeremy frowned at the ceiling he was lying on the couch with his hands clasped across his stomach trying off and on to think of another piece to work on he did nt feel like seeing anyone at all but while he was framing an answer brian gave up and went away again and jeremy heard his voice and mary s and then the slamming of the front door he rose and padded over to a window there was brian crossing the street weaving his way between cars stopped for a traffic light arriving on the opposite sidewalk in a sudden burst of speed as if he had just made a daring escape jeremy watched after him for as long as he was in sight it seemed to him that brian s walk was lighthearted to freedom at suppertime when mary came with another tray she said why would nt you see brian perhaps tomorrow i will you re not still angry about what happened at the gallery are you jeremy i honestly do nt think no it s just you see i m busy with a new piece he told her oh i see actually he never went straight from one piece to the next it was necessary to have a regathering period an idle space sometimes stretching into weeks but mary said i hope it s going well then and she took away his lunch dishes and left him his supper and a mug of hot coffee when she was gone he turned off the light and went back to the couch by now the studio was in twilight a linty grayness that he could almost feel on his skin in spite of the warmth him that his heart had slowed and his hands and feet were chilled he stretched out on the couch and went to sleep and the afghan made him dream of being held prisoner in some confined and airless place long before dawn he awoke with a start he spent several seconds wondering where he was the doubt was more pleasant than disturbing even after he had found the answer he kept trying to push it away again so that he could return to that floating rootless state then he rose and ate supper in the dark cold vegetables and meatloaf a bowl of some sticky thick liquid that turned out to be melted ice cream every swallow gagged him but he ate the entire meal and he finished the last of his cold bitter coffee with a feeling of accomplishment was nt that what life was all about steadfast endurance in the dark where his thoughts seemed more significant than they did in daytime he decided that this was what made the difference between him small and large while mary saw virtue in the refusal to accept she was always ready to do battle against the tiniest infringement he considered those battles now with fondness he pictured her tall energetic figure fending off door to door salesmen and overbearing teachers and grade school bullies and household germs all with the same enthusiasm it seemed to him that his acceptance and her defiance made up a perfect whole with neither more right than the other although up till now he had always assumed that one of them would be proved wrong in the end he worked through this idea with a feeling of relief he even thought of going downstairs to wake mary and tell her about it but of course she would have no idea what he meant she never wondered about the same things he did did she wonder about anything she would only smile at him with sleepy half closed eyes and open the blankets and pull him in to her her answer to all their problems he dragged sat there wrapped in his afghan watching the sky whiten over the city was it possible that once in the years before mary the house had been this still even in the daytime he had trouble remembering it he began pretending that this silence was permanent that mary and the children had gone away for some reason and left the house echoing behind them then he considered his
past him like he was joshing me that s good wages for a boy he says and that burro wo nt spend nothing on whiskey i am referring to the carcasses and corpses and entrails and skins hanging on your wall millie says well miz bender we re out here in country where the corn do nt grow zack says i tried eating rocks but it did nt work i want to go outside a minute i says to staggs calls of nature out back he says could nt you at least hang the corpses outdoors somewhere millie says the bears and injuns would love that zack says but it would nt do us much good at suppertime i finally had to shove staggs out of the way being as polite as i could without giving ground and i ducked out the door knocking my hat sideways and i and when i run to the side of the house there was badger fifty foot up the slope carrying my whipsaw over his big fat shoulder and the crockful of quicksilver in his other hand i grabbed the ax off of my wheelbarrow not wanting to go empty handed and lit off after him and i says mr badger not yelling so s to keep everybody else from getting worked up it being my belief that the fewer folks involved in a fight the shorter it s likely to be he stopped looking surprised and shifty eyed and mad holding the little crock behind his deerskin leggings in case i had nt seen it and then he put on as good a face as he could since he did nt have but two choices run or talk and running s hard work i believe you ve got something of mine there i says stopped two steps off there was a little pine grove a few yards up ahead them and lost our elbow room he grinned on one side of his face and says just going to saw me a couple planks boy long as you was nt using it i seen a stack of rough cut six foot long sluice boxes the kind i d seen tore out of the miner s own book and nailed up at the generalstore back home and a couple of sawhorses but badger had nt been heading for them but off slantways into the woods and i says you did nt ask my leave people do nt have time to go through all that neighborly talk way out here he says and no sheriff to learn them how he looked at my ax you fixing to chop some wood i felt ashamed about that ax he was a whole lot fatter than me but no taller and after all that walking and hauling i was as strong as i was ever going to be you was a mind to but the whipsaw was a mean looking chunk of steel with teeth as big as a bobcat s and five foot long from handle to handle and i did nt fancy being mistook for no pine tree so i just hefted the ax to show him i knew which end was which and says yes sir i was and i reckon i ll need that whipsaw to go with it and my quicksilver too if you do nt mind he looked down at that heavy little crock as if he d forgot all about it i just borried a taste of this jam to sweeten up the sawing ai nt had a taste of jam in eight months badger i heard old zack s voice yelling from back by the hut but i did nt let my eyes stray off here you can have it back badger says holding the crock out a short ways if you want i could see i was going to have to get too close to him and though that meant be could nt swing the saw good i did nt fancy rassling with nobody that fat i says i d be much obliged if you d just bring both them things back to my wheelbarrow and put them the way they was well who was your slave last year boy he says flexing the saw by one handle and making it sing goddamn it leave me alone zack yells back behind me but i did nt turn to look you re mean just like your brother badger says grinning i reckon i ll make you fight me for this trash here just to teach you how we do things on slab crick mr bender millie says loud and high which leg do you reckon you can best do without i says hefting the ax tossed the crock off to one side and i heard it thud and roll but kept my eyes off it hoping it had nt broke badger took a half a step backwards and had both hands on one of the saw handles which of them heads of yours would you like to have lopped off from near behind staggs s voice says you raise that ax on my pardner boy and i ll shoot you right in the spine half out of breath millie says is there anything i can do mr bender yes stay clear i says now what in the hell is going on zack says what you doing with that boy s saw zack you dumb bastard why do nt you go take a walk and practiceup lying staggs says no sense to quarreling among our selves mr badger walked off with my whipsaw and my quicksilver i says go on give him his saw you damn tub of lard zack says quicksilver staggs says where at out of the corner of my eye i seen millie scampering and stoopingand picking up the crock and i kept my ax ready for all the bad things that could happen any second now hoping
she might mention that nobody said anything i still keep thinking they will i did nt get my dime s worth what became of her nothing she is still a dull plain child in my archives that s the way she stops the branches of my family have grown apart i can kick myself for fumbling all those pricelesschances i had with virginia at the office for more than half a year and with a couple of girl scout sisters i knew from high school earlier i thought they were only kidding in their giggling insinuations and they were having genuine sex parties with older boys from tougher neighborhoods who would crash parties in our neighborhood they had not been invited to and break them up it was rumored they raped girls seeing my big brother with his fly open on the floor of that shadowy coal shed beside our brick apartment house with a kid named billy foster s skinny kid sister who was in my own class in grade school but not as smart my big brother was nt even that big then had nipples you could notice but no breasts but was doing was in geography history or math but was going all the way already with guys as old and big as my big brother while i was nt even jerking off yet abusing and browbeating my children i have seen them turn dumbfounded and aghast when they thought i was annoyed ob served how insurmountable their plight in trying to talk normally their heart clogs their mouth i see them trembling in such debilitating anxiety and want to hit them for being so weak later i condemn myself and am even angrier at them dishonoring my wife i no longer want to tyrannize her and i try not to make passes at anyone who knows her capitulating in craven weakness and camouflaged shame so often in the past to my possessive domineering mother in law who bossed me around a lot in the beginning while i had to make believe she did nt and my shrewish domineering sister in law who is pinched and nasty now and whose face is drying up peach pit for surrendering so totally despairingly fatalistically to broad and overbearing unforgettable mrs yerger in the automobile casualty insurance company who towered over me then it seemed and comes to mind always now when i m fuming over derek s nurse i do nt know why we call her a nurse she does no nursing she s a caretaker she takes care of my mentally retarded son when she hove into view like a smirking battleship moving out of one indistinct department of the company to take command of the file room i knew on sight with a chill in my blood and bones and a feeling of frost on my fingertips that she would fire me soon if i did nt quit sooner and again and again for fumbling it so thoroughly with luscious busty virginia back there in the office i worked in as a dumb shy frightened and idiotically ingenuous virgin little boy who felt like a waif and sometimes worse what a dope i was do one i know in this whole world who will have an inkling of what i am talking about virginia might understand but virginia will not be in earshot when i lose control of my reason in senility or delirium and begin pressing upon strangers such puzzles of ancient germinal importance to me as do you remember mrs yerger i remember mrs yerger and i remember virginia is dead too now and would be a peeling water bag of emphysema and phlebitis if she were not what a feeble minded idiot i could have had her then she was hot i was petrified what in hell was inhibiting me so long strangulating me no wonder when i finally tore free it was with a vengeance the company is still there she is nt it has nt grown nobody ever hears of it everybody hears of this one and life has pretty much been one damned sterile office desk after another for me ever since apart from the army what a deal i blew i was a moron i have laid my wife on the desk of my study more than once and on the desk in my office in the city one sunday afternoon while the kids were off on their own watching the holiday show at the radio city music hall they thought that was corny what good tits i could have been nibbling on all those months instead of those soggy canned salmon and tomato or baloney and mustard sandwiches my mother made for me to take to the city for lunch to save money i enjoyed those sandwiches too i d lick her lips and large breasts now with my salmon and tomato tongue no i would nt everything would be the same if i had her now and i was the one who was older i would probably be calculating my ass off trying to keep free of her squirm loose unscarred with a fairly clear conscience as i find myself doing habitually with all my pattys and even with my slim smiling tall supple very young jane a kid my refreshing new temptation in the art department who would be putty in my hands but how long can you remain entranced with putty i break dates with girls with the same proud feelings of accomplishment enjoy when i make them it is easier to break dates than keep them and takes up less time all we really have is time what we do nt have is what to do with it so i make dates most of my girls have been very good to me that s what i feel girls are for but i do nt want to see any of them frequently and ca nt bear
jadi asked him to come to their hogan her cool attitude toward him to be the lack of proper introductions and his face burned with shame at his forwardness jadi s father was a squat man broad in the shoulders and jovial in appearance he was definitely henpecked by his more aggressive wife who despised his lighthearted attitude but reveled in the wealth he had so easily accumulated when younger he had been called slim by the white men and the name stuck added to slim was a second name of his choice joe chief knew the heavy man thereafter as joe slim the dominant ruler of the large family was like a sleeping dog ready to growl in its sleep at any disturbance quick to snap when awakened chief decided she must have been on her best behavior at the squaw dance the social activity mellowing her menacing snarl he forgot her given name soon after he learned it and referred to her in his mind thereafter as sally jane she so reminded him of hatch s quarrelsome wives was aware of the mother s scrutinizing glances in his direction joe slim was content to inquire after his health but not so his wife she knew why he had come but she was not ready to relinquish her daughter to just anyone the girl was worth many fine presents the greedy mother calculated chief s presence intently the memory of the silver and turquoise belt impressed on her mind joe slim his curiosity aroused allowed his wife her rude questioning but visibly showing his approval of this young man he admitted this to chief freely jadi having been sent away as soon as she introduced chief s presence the woman pried into his background chief being cautious to answer as he thought she would like why are not your parents here to make proper arrangements instead of you i have no parents or relatives that are close where are your parents and people living chief knew this woman would scorn his mixed blood my father lived on navajo mountain my mother came from elk mountain north of the river a heavy silence fell as the woman considered this new development perhaps if he were wealthy this parentage would not be so important no one else need know do you have other line horses like the one you ride chief knew he was defeated he did not have anything to give in return for the girl he wanted to take as his wife though he felt she was worth the world it would take him many long months maybe years to accumulate enough fortune to buy her still unashamed at his poverty he answered the woman my riches are in my heart and mind joe slim looked at the prospective groom with approval mixed with sadness chief would make a fine husband for his favorite daughter but it was not his place to give the couple their right to marry and his wife would never allow it i have ventured joe as he looked sideways at his wife would you accept the palomino chief asked hope mixed with despair at the thought of parting with his golden companion just one snorted the woman is that all you consider my daughter worth suddenly this bargaining took on a new meaning to chief it was much more than a means of obtaining a wife it also placed the man s opinion of her worth i ll give you ten horses equal to lightning if you will allow me one year chief stated the woman s eyes gleamed at the prospect never had she heard of such an offer but on second thought how did this youth propose to acquire that many horses in so short a time what could she lose by agreeing if he did nt someone else might agreed one year chief left the hogan unaware of his surroundings he was not worthy willing to give everything he could ever possess for her even ten horses was not enough jadi was again with the sheep as chief looked at her in the distance he felt a deep longing and despair at being so utterly incapable of having what he desired most if only he could ride over and take her away with him they could live forever in happiness but it would not he happiness until he could prove his love as he had promised he must leave knowing he might never see her again unless he could find a job better than any he had ever had thus far lie had never felt so alone since his mother died that deep hurt would never heal and chief was determined not to add any more pain to his already heavy heart as he directed lightning toward bluff chief was thinking about tomorrow and where to find a job in over six thousand head of cattle grazed the eastern slopes of the blue mountains and the quaking aspen and clumped oaks sheltered cool mountain streams bordered by abundant grazing providing a fat and comfortable life for the animals comparable to the variety in size and shape of the cattle were their colorful owners mavericks in their own right they had come to the safety of remote blue mountain country exulting in the wealthy land that received them one of the more successful ranchers was an englishman named harold carlisle rumored to be a lord the bull headed man managed the herds of the sprawling carlisle ranch with the aid of his brother ted capitalizing on the promises each situation offered carlisle had overcome any thought of hardship or poverty in this new land and was living grandly on the toil of others he offered various renegades outlaws and a few honest men employment at a reduced wage in exchange for the security isolation provided from the lawmen and starvation low as the pay was it was better than the haphazard jobs
he had stolen he was carted away by the constable pierce dusted himself off looked around the wreckage of the office and apologized to the clerks and the dispatcher then the other gentleman who had joined in the pursuit said i fear sir that you have missed your train by god i have and the two gentlemen departed the one thanking the other for helping corner the thief and the other saying it was nothing leaving the clerks to clean up the mess it was pierce later reflected a nearly perfect jolly gaff hykey doings when clean willy williams the snakesman arrived at pierce s house late in the afternoon of january he found himself confronted by a very strange spectacle in the drawing room pierce wearing a red velvet smoking jacket lounged in an easy chair smoking a cigar utterly relaxed a stopwatch in his hands in contrast agar in shirtsleeves stood in the center of thei the keysroom agar was bent into a kind of half crouch he was watching pierce and panting slightly are you ready pierce said agar nodded go pierce said and flicked the stopwatch to clean willy s amazement agar dashed across the room to the fireplace where he began to moving in a low whisper seven eight nine that s it pierce said door door agar said and in pantomime turned the handle on an unseen door he then took three steps to the right and reached up to shoulder height touching something in the air cabinet pierce said cabinet now agar fished two wax flats out of his pocket and pretended to make an impression of a key time he asked thirty one pierce said agar proceeded to make a second impression on a second set of flats all the while counting to himself thirty three thirty four thirty five again he reached into the air with both hands as if closing something cabinet shut he said and took three paces back across the room door agar said and ran in place once more and then sprinted across the room to halt beside pierce s chair done he cried pierce looked at the watch and shook his head sixtynine he puffed on his cigar well agar said in a wounded tone it s better than it was what was the last time your last time was seventy three well it s better but not good enough maybe if you do nt close thehykey doings cabinet and do nt hang up the keys either willy can do that do what willy said watching open and close the cabinet pierce said agar went back to his starting position ready pierce said ready agar said once again this odd charade was repeated with agar sprinting across the room jogging in place pretending to wax impressions taking three steps closing a door jogging in place and then running across the room time pierce smiled sixty three he said agar grinned gasping for breath once more pierce said just to be certain later in the afternoon clean willy was given the lay it ll be tonight pierce said once it s dark you ll go up to london bridge and get onto the roof of the station that a problem clean willy shook his head what then when you re on the roof cross to a window that is broken you ll see it it s the window to the dispatcher s office little window barely a foot square what then get into the office through the window yes what then then you will see a cabinet pierce looked at the little snakesman you ll have to stand on a chair to reach it be very quiet there s a jack posted outside the office on the steps clean willy frowned unlock the cabinet pierce said with this key he nodded to agar who gave willy the first of the picklocks unlock the cabinet and open it up and wait what for around ten thirty there ll be a bit of a shindy a soak will be coming into the station to chat up the jack what then then you unlock the main door to the office using this key here agar gave him the second key and then you wait what for for eleven thirty or thereabouts when the jack goes to the w c then agar comes up the steps through the door you ve unlocked and he makes first door right away by now the jack is back from the loo you lock the cabinets put the chair back and go out the window quiet like that s the lay clean willy said doubtfully that s the lay you popped me out of newgate for this clean willy said this is no shakes to knock over a deadlurk it s a deadlurk with a jack posted at the door and it s quiet you ll have to be quiet like all the time clean willy grinned those keys mean a sharp vamp you ve planned just do the lay pierce said and quiet piece of cake clean willy said keep those dubs handy agar said pointing to the keys and have the doors ready and open when i come in or it s nommus for all of us do nt want to be nibbed willy said then look sharp and be ready clean willy nodded what s for dinner he said chapter breaking the drumon the evening of january th a characteristic london pea soup fog heavily mixed with soot blanketed the town clean willy williams easing down tooley street one eye to the facade of london bridge station was not sure he liked the fog it made his movements on the ground less noticeable but it was so dense that he could not see the second story of the terminus building and he was worried about access to the roof it would nt do to make the climb halfway only to discover it
not drive on without pay ment of twenty five dollars or by presenting a pass indicating that he was a resident of the city this is a public thoroughfare walker said i ve traveled it dozens of times and no one has ever said anything about a toll he got up behind the wheel tell the chief one of the men said to another walker decided to put the ford into reverse gear back up to the corner and go another way he turned in his seat at this moment two of the firemen carrying a twenty foot ladder between them came into the street behind the car two others followed with an other ladder and others came out with carts of coiled hose buckets axes hooks and other fire fighting equipment all of which was deposited in the street the company having chosen this particular moment to sweep out its quarters the chief of wore at a cocky angle he was also somewhat older than the rest he was courteous to coalhouse and ex plained that while the toll had never before been collected from him it was nevertheless in force and that if coalhouse did not pay up he would not pass with his two hands he lifted his hat from his head and reset it so that the visor covered his eyes this caused him to tilt his chin upwards in order to see giving him a pugnacious look he was a heavyset man with thick arms many of the volunteers were grinning we need the money for a firetruck the chief explained so we can drive to fires just like you drive to whorehouses the negro calmly considered the courses of action available to him the emerald isle firehouse looked across the street to an open field that sloped down to a pond conceivably he might drive off the road turn in the field and circumnavigate the ladders and hose cart but he was wedged wheel hard enough to clear the horses the severe angle of the turn might tilt the car over on the downhill slope apparently it did not occur to him to ingratiate himself in the fashion of his race playing down at the edge of the pond were a couple of negro boys ten or twelve years old hey coalhouse walker called to them come on up here the boys came running they stared at coalhouse as he switched off the engine set the brake and stepped down to the road i want you to watch this car he told them when i come back you tell me if anyone touched it the musician quickly strode back to the corner and headed toward the business district after ten minutes he found a policeman operating a stop and go traffic signal the policeman listened to his complaint and shook his head and spent some time removing his handkerchief from under his frock coat and blowing his nose those boys do nt mean no harm he finally said i re probably tired of the sport walker may have realized this was probably the maximum support he could expect from a policeman at the same time he may have wondered if he d been oversensitive to what was intended as no more than a prank so he went back to firehouse lane the fire engine and horses were withdrawn the road was empty of volunteers and his car stood off the road in the field ile made his way to the car it was spattered with mud theree l doctorow was a six inch tear in the custom pantasote top and deposited in the back seat was a mound of fresh human excrement he went across the street to the firehouse door standing there with his arms folded was the chief in his white military cap and green bohemian tie the police department advises me there is no toll road anywhere in this city coalhouse walker said that s right said the chief anyone is free to come and go on this road anytime he the electric lights were on inside the firehouse through the glass panels in the door the negro could see the three matching grays in their stalls the great nickel plated pumper with its brass fittings backed up to the rear wall i want my car cleaned and the damage paid for he said the chief began to laugh and a couple of his men came out to join the fun at this moment a police van drove up it carried two officers one of them the traffic policeman to whom coalhouse walker had appealed he went into the field looked at the car and came back to the firehouse willie the policeman said to the fire chief did you or your boys do

thought this signified something of had drawn the best lodging in town drawn he knew was not the right word there was no lottery no choosing by means of long and short straws he had been offered by the widow culligan the loft room in her pendleton home she had ignored the general ignored patrick conroy originally like herself from the old sod given noah beazley the very picture of a dark and handsome city lawyer the go by she had offered the room to charlie because she told him you look like my late son charlie reminded them of their late husbands reminding a widow of her late son was more to his liking he moved into the widow s loft room at once without wasting time or pity on his fellow lawyers they the general among them were piled two in a bed in less commodious lodgings the feathers of the ticking and comforters he slept between smelled sweet and fresh some heat spilled into the room from the fireplace chimney that took up one end of the loft he had that frontier luxury a looking glass spotted to be sure like a pond with lily pads but between the spots he could see his own face he doubted he looked like the late son charles fort he had been told you re an oddity not a mud fence ugly oddity kisses had told him that but no one else s spit and image for sure he was dish faced with a head of fine black hair that a brisk big round and set shal low in his head were the color of water in a rain barrel neither blue nor gray his nose did nt have much of a bridge but it made up for the lack at the top by flaring out into race horse nostrils at the bottom he bared his teeth to the glass nothing lacking there he could bite with a beaver he was longheaded and a trifle lanternjawed but his long head was set on a stud horse neck a neck broad as his face at the cheekbones the looking glass did nt show him below the adam s apple but he knew what was there a body wideshouldered spare in the short ribs and waist and supported by thighs heavy and meaty like his neck i m no adonis charlie admitted to himself but who needed looks when he had luck he got good horses at livery stables helpings from the first serving at boardinghouses and whiskey from taverns the secretary of war himself or at least the general had asked that he come to pendleton on this historic case the widow offered him her spare room because he with a face like no one else s looked like her son when his family had been killed by indians as they were moving from kentucky to ohio he the sole survivor age two had been found carried into cincinnati and adopted there by the man he thought of as father enoch leverett leverett had sent him east to harvard where the bright yankee boys went planning for him to take over the leverett newspaper the western spy when he graduated in spite of himself charlie turned out to be a lawyer a newspaper writer has to tone things down charlie had watched leverett do this for years a lawyer could tear the rag off the bush could tell the jury facts that would lose an editor every subscriber he had charlie s mouth that and so made use of what charlie could do send him facts that he could cut dress up water down add to until they were fit for print beneath the spotted looking glass when charlie had moved into the room was a deal table holding washbowl pitcher soap dish and drinking glass the room had no washstand the chamberpot was under the bed charlie took all this paraphernalia from the table moved the table under the loft s one window and had himself a desk he brought a rush bottomed chair upstairs put his paper newly sharpened quill and newly mixed ink on the table and sat down to write enoch leverett what he had promised a report of this outlandish place and of this outrageous trial he knew the western spy was nt interested in how charlie fort was making out amongst the woodsies and redskins he did nt begin his writing with dear pa that would lead him into a redheaded girl he had seen who had made him want to follow her into the green gloom of the unending stands of trees the way men run after fox fire in a swamp he wrote in what he considered a newspaper style but for a newspaper whose sole reader was enoch leverett he said pendleton had a population of two hundred souls not people that was newspaper lingo but he could nt bring himself to substitute we for i we saw what other pair of eyes saw what he saw no he was nt that much of a reporter extracts from a letter by charles fort to enoch leverett pendleton is a town of two hundred souls i made the mistake when i first arrived here of calling pendleton a settlement the pendletonians wasted no time setting me right on that score a settlement is a place like fall creek twenty miles upriver no stores streets or taverns there pendleton is a town my idea three thousand books in our library board walks street lights i doubt if half a dozen books could be scared up in this entire settlement excuse me i mean town excluding of course the good book they own that even if they do nt always follow it as the recent murders prove on my first day here i was told that i was expected at midday to take dinner with judge giddings three judges sit here a presiding judge appointed
place chantry suddenly changed his tone this is land bought legally from the indians when the time is right i ll transfer title to it long after they had me inside and in bed i heard the murmur of her voice out there with them she was nt blonde with golden curls and all but she was pretty she was almighty beautiful and twenty be seventeen and i was a man growed and she even said i had nerve later some time later i heard pa say if there s nothin there an you know it why do nt you just tell em i tried to they believe too hard kernohan men will give up anything rather than what they want to believe and hate you for telling them there s nothing to believe and even if you prove it to them they ll continue to believe and hate you for proving them foolish sometimes they give up but they ll like you no more i ve seen men come to a ground where treasure was said to be buried and with holes all over the hills they ll dig another one and then another one thing i know my brother was here for some time if there was anything of value here he would have found it would leave some clue chantry paused moreover knowing him he would probably leave such a clue as only i would be apt to discover what kinda clue could that be chantry shrugged i will have to remember what passed between us and which of my tastes he knew best clive was a fine man a much better man than i in every moral way but he had a complicated mind and so have i and any clue he left would be useful to no one else well said pa for the life of me i ca nt figger out what kinda clue or how you d ever guess it i i ve got to go back marny said chantry turned toward her do nt stay here no i ve got to go back at least one more time i have things there well i will they know you ve been to the cabin no i do nt think so but they ll go there now mac mowatt will be certain he can find what there is they ll tear the place apart maybe not owen chantry said maybe i ll be there alone against them all i wo nt be inside i ll keep some freedom of action i heard chantry walk across the room yes i think i must do that i must be there when they come i want to keep that cabin it s lonely pa said it s a mighty lonely place of a wintertime a man could be snowed in that house must be nine thousand feet up i ve been up high before i never seen her go she just taken off and was gone when i waked up with only the but i was scared for her scared i had a bad feeling about her going back i tried to sit up and got such a stab of pain in my side that i laid down quick gasping for breath she was gone there was nothin i could do if i just had my old rifle and was up in them rocks well maybe i could nt do nothin but could surely try suddenly chantry stood over me you all right doby i heard you cry out did nt mean to yeah i m all right but i wish you d bring her back that s a bad outfit i wish you d fetch her owen chantry i ll be at the cabin she knows that if she ever gets there mr chantry i m scared i m plumb scared for her she do nt think they knew she knowed there chantry looked grim and he had a face for it he was a right handsome man but there was a coldness in him sometimes that would frighten a man i ll just go see doby i ll ride up there right now today he wasted no time he got on the big black and taken his packhorse and headed for the hills and seein him ride out i wondered what would happen when him and the mowatts come together maybe he was only one man and they was many but she sure would nt be no one sided fight not with him being the other side no matter how many they had there was soinethin about that man that made you believe even me who up til then had nt wanted to believe much of anything bout owen chantry somehow busted ribs and all i had to be there i had to be up on that mountain when man without illusions nothing in his experience had given him the idea that he was protected by any special dispensation from providence he had seen good men die when the evil lived on and he was aware that he was as vulnerable as any other man yet a man does nt command a cavalry outfit scout for the army against the indians drive a stage and ride shotgun without acquiring a feeling for the possibilities chantry s life was due to his own skill and to a certain amount of sheer coincidence for if he was a foot past the spot where bullets struck it was only circumstance and the fact that he was moving faster or slower than the men the bullets found owen chantry had asked no favors of destiny he put himself in the hands of his own skills a good horse and a good gun crossing the canyon at a place where another canyon joined it from the east he climbed a rough but not too difficult trail it aspens which were favored by beavers and elks he took his time at

do nt believe this the kid and i are staring at each other he is large and black i go back to eyes winterneet and pavlovenka seem to be scrapping i tell my students she s saying to write what they feel to experiment to throw off the tyrannical old forms hear hear i think and impose on the poor young people the tyranny of freedom says winterneet hear hear i think again pavlovenka worries she does nt like people saying unkind things about freedom how d you mean tyranny i mean it s hard having to invent a free verse form for every new occasion it is nt hard for my students to write free verse pavlovenka says but may nt it be hard says winterneet his pale nose pinched eyes gummed by his recent illness he turns his famous bald old head with a weary sweetness in pavlovenka s direction might it not be hard forgive me on their readers even the often toward maurie seem to be choosing to be opaque and boring maurie who seemed to be dozing in his chair rouses himself to say which brings me to my subject why publish what nobody will read the reading public not to speak of the publishing community is a bunch of gertrudes poor gertrude she s so horrified to see the prince familiarly in conversation with what looks to her exactly like the empty air she must conclude he s mad or at best a put on artist remember the little man who slashed the early picasso canvases one concluded he was mad why this passion why not stay quietly at home but how could he ignore what must be proved to be nothing or prove him blind and deaf and dumb that s very very terrible no wonder these gertrudes plant the letter for our execution in our pockets and put us out to sea and while you says the real world burns the speakers along the table stir newman overwrought and intense leans toward maurie who leans back in his chair like some fat farouk of the intellect and says yes his smile is warm and his eyes are spunky but newman will not let maurie be charming he bends his neck into a u and forces maurie to face what he is about to say and says i m talking about hunger that s true i think dazzled by the enormity he means i publish poetry the world starves maurie gives the word its fullest and slowest weight neither causes nor prevents the other and that s true too i think what you publish says newman is an elitist magazine hear hear says pavlovenka written says newman by a couple of dozen literati read not even by each other says newman i never read it pavlovenka assures him i publish literature says maurie literature is elitist newman says right on from the stage manager in the wings oh but pavlovenka says what winterneet and meyers cry is that true i wonder are nt you begins betterwheatling errant crap says maurie and you know it newman while winterneet says newman is embalming the sonnet and the villanelle the stage manager laughs you do nt take my meaning says winterneet with irritable eagerness zeus puts his mouth close to my ear and whispers you ll have to pay admission if you re going to enjoy yourself it s true my head is turning from one to the other how beautifully each is says newman i jump writes for her private prophylaxis she says the way she cleans her teeth you know what i meant i cry shocked i thought i was on his side he s righter surely than the rest of us i only meant that writing has grown as deep as habit are nt you betterwheatling tries again what i meant winterneet leans toward newman is that to refuse forms perfected by the past is like having to invent the bed each time you want to go to sleep your forms says newman were created on the backs of blacks and women cries pavlovenka are nt you confusing betterwheatling says i m talking says winterneet about the mastery of technique technique is racist says newman its purpose is to master slaves promises are nt you confusing the realms of poetry and politics says betterwheatling bending his neck into a u to force newman s attention poetry is politics says newman oh yes from the wings meyers leans forward intently io god s silent searching flight when my lord s head was filled with dew he says but newman sits back in his chair and laughs into the audience and says not my lord and all his locks are wet with the clear drops of night his still soft call sings meyers reaching across maurie to touch newmanon the arm to make him listen newman trumpets into his handkerchief his knocking time the soul s dumb watch when spirits their fair kindred catch what about their dark kindred shouts newman and sticks his middle finger into the air by technique do nt you see says winterneet he looks exhausted i mean what has become as the techniques of grammar grammar is racist cries newman laughing and sexist i yell i m getting into the spirit except you need it to deny it shouts maurie the hell you say newman cries we will invent our own absolutely newman i agree with you calls pavlovenka that s your problem says newman without looking at her straight or butchered betterwheatling says it will be english english pronounces newman with an excruciating clarity is an imperialist language its grammar and vocabulary so perverted in the service of oppression and obfuscation it has lost its capacity for truth english is no longer capable of poetry pavlovenka splutters meyers howls betterwheatling maurie and winterneet have risen to their feet shouting what newman can not hear in the uproar i m
was yesterday bogas that i said it today i am of cynaetha for two from one city breed plotting and ill luck luck spoil already lachas said bogas four it is luck and of hermes five it is of no luck he turned upon me a look of malice the rest grew grave and one began i too have heard but the captain breaking in blustered them clown you have heard yea you have heard many lies and believed them will you quote me the cant of priests and choose me a holy number for a gang like ours then to bogas let no barbarian make talk of hermes for the god will be vexed i tell you the luck is not of numbers bring luck but if you will have it that five is luckless he who grumbles shall be fifth so he silenced them but i still fearful of bogas held up my bare hands saying see lachas i alone of this pack am toothless is it well he frowned then laughed and said tomorrow you shall be fanged tonight i will growl beside my cub and none shall molest him he spread a pallet beside his own and there he bade me lie and make no more talk then going back to the wine he drank and howled impious songs and jests with the rest till the sputtering torch had burned low in its cleft of stone at last unable to bear more they reeled to their beds where they fell and lay face upward with a snorting as of crocodiles on mud banks of nile i had laid myself down on my left side for the better guarding against my ribs i rejoiced in it moreover it helped to keep me awake and even so i had almost lost myself many times how i had dared to plan what i now ventured is still an amazement to me in after years in the full strength of manhood ripened with perils i would have hesitated but the danger of lingering among them was scarcely less and to lead a life like theirs seemed worse than present death the silver too incited me it was mine i would not give it up i would have the spending of it at whatever risk i rose on my elbow then to my knees the giant beside me trumpeted through his nose like that great beast of indus ridden by porus though of that i had then no thought i reached out with my hand with the tender stealth of a mother who would not wake her child i drew a knife from his girdle and the joy of a weapon filled i felt the edge it was keener than that with which i had slit the cobbler s leather and such a new boldness possessed me that seeing an amulet hanging awry from his neck i gently cut its thong and took it leaning close to his face but i would not harm him unless at utmost need brute though he was he had been kinder to me than my uncle or my city toward bogas who lay a little aloof from the rest dim in the gloom i cast a look but turned away hastily i presumed no further but stole out softly from that evil place and as the fresh wind of the mountain smote in my face i had a longing to shout for very gladness but i fled in silence under the brightening sky through dusky ravines and down slopes of some hazard till with the rising sun i stood on the edge of tilled land and the wide boeotian plain lay before me so richer only in the wit that breeds so quickly from danger for as i view it now i had left my boyhood in that den of thieves in which is related how i entered the service of a tyrant and how i helped to deliver a city of the years that followed until that great adventure in which i first saw doria when also i learned the might of apollo and what his favor may mean to men i am not so proud as to make a long tale of it yet within this time i grew to the full four cubits of manhood of all statures the best for endurance and active strength so that my eyes now looked downward into the faces of most and while i thus outgrew my comrades and my sinews toughened until my javelin cast at full stretch with a thong was upward of a hundred paces i learned in the hard school of service such lessons of craft and skill that when i offered my spear none was chosen was less easy and once in thessaly for unasked counsel to daiphantus concerning the order of battle i received on my shoulders such an acknowledgment from his staff that even today my back aches at the thought of it that the counsel i gave was sound i will still maintain for the event showed it yet so i was taught that in war one voice alone must be heard hence i mastered the gift of silence and of speech that tells even less b t will of apollo and learned at last to trust none wholly and living thus my heart grew hard with my body all this came slowly like a soldier s pay and though my adventures were many they were not altogether such as one would care to recount in later days i shall therefore deal with these years of my schooling in arms quite curtly as ptolemy treats of the time before alexander crossed the hellespont yet some part i will tell when after my flight and made known my name i expected to be made much of because of my father but in this i was sorely disappointed i was indeed as a matter of no consequence allowed to enter
and attention moved over to the door opened it part way and peered out carefully when he was satisfied he opened it all the way and stood to one side the uniformed men stepped out one at a time like paratroopers from a plane first leaning then whooshing quickly to their right as if into a slipstream sonnenleitner stood at the door and watched them kruse drew a mauser automatic the magazine examined it then clicked it back into place when he looked up it was at charity and with a smile that did nothing for the narrow eyes we are ready sonnenleitner said when she turned she noticed that he too had an automatic pistol in his hand a walther model pp they walked quickly and quietly down the carpeted corridor charity in between turning the corner with almost comical parade like precision all the uniformed men were in place all held their shotguns up against their chests in the position of present arms when they were abreast of ruter s door sonnenleitner and kruse noiselessly joined the men pressed up against the wall and she stood there and waited until they were ready when the detective inspector nodded she stepped several paces forward and knocked at first there was no answer then a muffled wer ist da came from the other side of the door kurt love it s me door i ca nt find my watch and i think i left it somewhere in the room she did nt look at the men flattened against the wall the key turned in the lock and the door opened first a crack and then a little more darling she said smiling looking straight into his eyes they rushed in then from both sides sonnenleitner pushing her out of the way as he passed so hard that she stumbled back against the far wall she did nt wait to see how it turned out her job was finished but she could nt help thinking as she began walking back down the corridor that there was surprisingly little noise coming from ruter s room much less than she would have guessed there d be when she came into view the manager stopped his pacing in front of the bank of elevators and stared at her she smiled to indicate that everything was over your rooms are too hot she was sehr heiss and she pointed at one of the doors too hot you give too much heat it is very uncomfortable he continued staring at her as if she was somehow mocking him never mind she said walking to the room for her bag leaning into the thick smoke just enough to pluck it out would you please get an elevator for me it s safe now it s all over ach yes he said i am so sorry and he rushed to take her bag which he then carried to the house telephone where he barked a brisk command it took only a few seconds for the elevator to arrive and when it did he stood to one side to let her walk in then handed the bag to the operator who looked to be about fourteen merry christmas she said just before the doors closed yes yes merry christmas to you too miss bay but he did nt put his heart in it the airport in hamburg was hot too and all but empty on christmas day and the first thing she did once inside was to take off her coat and drape it over her arm there was only one agent on duty at the lufthansa counter a handsome blond north german type with every gene in place he watched her approach with connoisseur like scrutiny first her legs then her breasts and finally the face when she stopped before him he rewarded her with a perfect smile obviously he approved but the smile waned somewhat when in addition to the passport and ticket for the flight she also removed a derringer from her purse broke it open to show that both chambers were empty and placed it on the counter regulations forbid the carrying of firearms on board airplanes they must be surrendered at the check in counters where they are registered dismantled and the airline or customs at the end of the flight you are much too beautiful to have to carry a gun the handsome agent said his guttural accent had a slight british flavoring to it may i please have the american customs form for this she said ignoring him i am certain that all a girl like you has to do is smile to have the men come running he insisted playfully teutonically but a gun rich that is so barbaric so violent why do nt you stop the nonsense and just hand me the form she said wearily the magnificent face blushed and the perfect eyes blinked in disbelief pardon i just said stop the nonsense and get on with your job for one thing i am not a girl and i do nt like being referred to as one for another i do nt want to carry on any kind of are not my type and if there is any objection on your part any whatsoever just cancel my ticket and i ll travel with pan am or twa the agent s face was beet red by then ein moment bitte he said standing to his full height and then retreating through a small door in the wall he returned a few seconds later with another perfect type only one who was older and seemed to have faded as a result of being laundered more miss bay the superior said barely glancing at her breasts i

life goes on sarah voskovek a m it was about a quarter to nine when i went to the elevator and punched the up button i doubted that the hotel chief of security would be at his desk yet and in any case i did nt know where his desk was i did know where sarah was so i went up to the sixth floor undoubtedly she was nt in yet but i would wait a reasonable length of time i was wrong she was in the girl at the outer desk still was nt there but i could see sarah in the inner room i knocked on the doorjamb and said hello she turned saw me and said come in she did nt smile somehow i felt smiling did nt come easy to her but she did nt frown either she was wearing a dark green outfit in which the collar stood up behind to try to learn them it was cut narrow and low in front just low enough to show a pleasant cleavage between breasts of light cream it was a pleasant sight for the morning she said how are you darius you look a little worn bad day followed by bad night it s all right she changed her cool expression into one of quiet sympathy it s mr devore s death of course yes if i had not come to see you at the luncheon what s the difference i was about due to remember and something else would have kicked it off if you had nt she said you know the medical examiner came at about seven thirty last night and took the body away i assumed he did it at some time in the evening what happened to eunice i mean mrs devore that i do not like me to get you coffee no i ve just had some what i d really like to do is to get say six hours of rest in which my brain was turned on to nothing but rest preferably in your arms why i said it i do nt know because she did nt appeal to me but when you reach middle age and have as checkered a career with women as i have had these things come out without real planning like slicing bread even as i heard myself say it i expected her to turn icy but she did nt rather shockingly she smiled and sat back in her chair well she said do nt do anything that will get me fired she caught me by surprise and the moment passed her muscles tightened and she was sitting up in her chair once more her posture excellent but is there anything in the business said when does the chief of security come in his name is even harder than yours or i d call him by that she looked at her watch it is marsogliani she pronounced it mahr soh lyah nee which is how i tried to say it afterward he s usually quite early but i do nt know if he s arrived and if he has arrived he may not be at his desk is it that you want to see him she asked lapsing into non english word order which just made her sound cuter quite a lot i said she shrugged i ll call him for you but you know he was a little annoyed with you yesterday did he tell you why he said you were a busybody no details i am a busybody i said at least right now i am for instance depends is there a drug problem at the hotel drug problem i mean is the hotel involved in some way in the sale or distribution of drugs dope heroin certainly not all right not the hotel but is it taking place here without the hotel s connivance that s what i mean she stared at me thoughtfully why are you asking this i said i m a busybody you are indeed it s not your business to ask a question like that nor is it mine to answer if you must ask you will have to ask mr marsogliani but i do nt see why he should answer you either would you call him she did he answered at least i suppose he answered since she talked as though he were on the phone she explained that i wanted to voice he only wishes to see you for a moment she had to guess that for it was not derived from anything i had said i got the impression he would nt have agreed to see me if i had nt been working through sarah chalk up one good decision for me in seeing her first and one good turn from the little woman thanks sarah i said i would nt want to do anything to make you lose your job but it requires restraint on my part she smiled a little just as i was walking out the receptionist walked in she moved behind the desk in the outer office put down her purse and looked at me and then at sarah with a kind of wise tolerance in her eyes she was a good looking black woman about thirty i should say i lifted both hands as though surrendering business i said strictly business she if it werent anthony marsogliani p m marsogliani was nt smiling when i reached his office which was also on the sixth floor he made me wait while he went over some papers leisurely making it perfectly clear he was nt rushing i sat there my mind detached prepared to show no signs of impatience but letting my eyes follow him in all his movements he was nt smoking a cigar but he smelled of stale cigar smoke just the same i guess he always did and he looked about the way he smelled sour and uninviting
new information with you made norton uneasy we have a witness kifner continued who claims to have seen someone leaving the house on volta place around midnight on the night miss hendricks was murdered who is your witness norton asked i m not going to identify the witness kifner said but i am going to tell you who he claims to have seen leaving the house that night okay who was it you ben gabe was stretched out full length on norton s sofa with a tumbler of scotch balanced on his belly as he talked he was alternately running his hand through his dandruff filled hair and scratching dead skin from his mottled forearms we re getting close he said fervently my rash is starting getting close norton said glumly gabe i got close to being blown to bits the other morning it was pure dumb luck that i was s safe for me to go out on the street any more nobody s gon na kill you in washington gabe said flicking his stubby fingers so that scraps of dead skin fluttered to the floor it s just out in the field that they pull stunts like that some guy bucking for a promotion trying to impress the home office just think if you d got blown up some up and coming spook would have made gs back here in washington the boys are more sophisticated they do nt plant bombs they plant ideas that s the way to really work a guy over you re right about that norton said my old pal frank kifner planted some ideas with me the other morning that have just about driven me up the wall like what well he might have a perjury count against me which i knew already and then he claimed to have a witness who saw was killed gabe laughed so explosively that his drink spilled onto his pants leg he cursed and grabbed the glass managing in the process to knock his ashtray onto the floor by the time he rearranged himself his smile had vanished and he stared at norton with narrowed eyes did you he said sharply did i what did you come out of the house that night you dummy norton groaned with disbelief no i did nt come out of the house that night i did nt kill her if that s what you re thinking the reporter shrugged and pulled at his wet pants leg stranger things have happened he muttered the thing is norton continued that kifner would nt tell me who his witness is if there really is one i mean he could be bluffing he s not bluffing gabe said he lit a lucky and he d spilled onto the floor how do you know he s not bluffing because i know who his witness is who for christ s sake joey smallwood the crazy kid in the liquor store that s him he s a professional window peeper always prowling around georgetown at night and they ve got him claiming he was across the street and saw you coming out some witness norton said bitterly you d think they d do better than that they do nt have to gabe said sure joey s too nutty for his testimony to hold up in court but they can ruin you just with the scandal or maybe they do bring a perjury charge and maybe they make it stick you get disbarred maybe do a year or two in the slammer and by that time nobody s gon na listen to what you say about you pal norton got up and poured them both another drink gabe stretched out on the sofa again blowing smoke rings toward the ceiling and scratching his arms his left wrist had begun to bleed and he licked the blood away occasionally i ve got a theory about this case gabe said after a while i have nt got all the details pinned down yet but it s coming let s hear it to start with you have to assume whitmore or murphy or somebody else in their inner circle zapped donna otherwise all this cover up does nt make any sense so what they need is a fall guy and it looks like you ve been elected why me why not you it makes sense the jilted lover and all that that s what that phone call to you telling you donna was dead was all about to make you do exactly what you did you who do you think called me my guess would be riddle he s up to his ears in this thing but and here s where things get complicated then joey comes along the nutty kid who waited on her in the liquor store and maybe followed her home or something joey not having a law degree or even much sense figures to be an even better fall guy than you so i figure they change strategies in midstream frame joey then why have they now got joey saying i did it because one he s got an all american mom who swears he was home that night and two you re such a pain in the ass they figure they ll shut you up okay gabe but if they re trying to frame me for the murder why did they try to blow me up the other day or does nt your theory extend that gabe admitted somebody might have figured that it d be easier to frame you if you were dead in absentia so to speak gabe took a swallow of his drink and then chewed at a hangnail for a minute or he said finally it could be that there s one bunch trying to frame you and another bunch trying to kill you you never want to underestimate the fuck up factor when you re dealing with the government they sat in
not a one woman show not yet but in new york i had some of my work in a group show what kind of group show she smiled i am almost afraid to tell you why it was a women s collective she said you mean women s lib feminists yes she glanced at him quickly taking in his reaction some men if you say that they yell and scream it does nt bother me he said there s something to it i guess so you re a feminist in a way she thought for a moment not truly they had come no one ahead of them he looked over his shoulder and saw that no one was behind them either his left arm remained curled easily around hers but his right arm tensed his right hand flexed readying itself no he told himself not yet there would be an opportunity later on maybe in another five minutes in the meantime he might as well learn more about her while he had the chance here isabella said i am a feminist i am thought of as a wild woman she laughed it is not hard to be thought of as a wild woman in italy to people who think of a woman as a domestic animal bed and kitchen and nothing elsei am a very bad person i am bad because i choose to be free but she went on i am not like some of the women i met in new york for instance she looked at him out of not hate men the path turned and ended they came out into a large opening that surrounded a lake it was fairly crowded and even though it was a weekday there was a holiday spirit in the air people lounged by the water or walked along the grassy banks or glided on the surface of the lake in small rowboats professional boatmen steered larger canopied boats with noisy children bouncing on them fat brown and white ducks were mooching crusts of bread from the generous hearted isabella stopped suddenly all it was a little gasp of excitement i burattini what puppets she pointed see a small crowd had gathered near a tall umbrella pine a miniature stage had been set up by the trunk of a tree and on it two puppets were jerking about come on she took his hand and with childlike eagerness dragged him after her they one puppet a grotesque little fellow wearing a black mask a peaked white hat and what seemed to be a white nightgown was singing off key in a loud squeaky voice the other one a handsome mustachioed puppet in a guardsman s jacket was yelling at him cursing him it seemed isabella was already laughing what s going on lacey asked this one does not like the way that one sings and he is she broke off and with a helpless wave of her hand said it does not translate white hat had stopped singing and now the two puppets were yelling at each other at the same time mustache disappeared beneath the stage then popped up again carrying a stick he beat white hat with it white hat got very agitated snatched away the stick and beat mustache in return it did nt seem very funny to lacey but he chuckled any way isabella took pleased that he saw the humor of it too he looked down at her she was no longer watching the puppets but was gazing up at him smiling he bent his head to kiss her it was an impulse he did nt pause to question it but as his lips were about to make contact with hers he stopped out of the corner of his eye he had caught sight of a figure that had emerged from behind the trunk of the umbrella pine had stepped clear of the puppet stage and was now standing facing them he straightened up and looked rather casually not so obviously that isabella would notice it was renato aziz s helper the young man was standing his hands on his hips staring at them with blatant interest let s go lacey said now isabella looked totally baffled i just remembered i ve got some work to do he took her nt look back at renato they said very little on the way back through the park or in the taxi no cars were allowed in the trevi fountain neighborhood so the driver let them out on the via del tritone two blocks from the rinaldis apartment they walked from there down the middle of the traffic free street isabella was obviously distressed she imagined she had done something wrong and of course she could nt guess what it was from time to time she would cast a nervous sidelong glance at him but lacey kept his eyes before him and said nothing they turned into the via delle muratte he went with her as far as the door of the rinaldis building then he took her hand and said it s been a beautiful afternoon isabella thank you i enjoyed it too alan she hesitated still uncompre bending then asked but what happened what is the matter he walked away when he turned the corner at the end of the block they were there waiting for him renato and another man a tall husky arab in a black sweater and black pants buon giorno signor martin renato said pleasantly i hope you boys are nt too tired from following me around lacey said renato smiled and shrugged it is nice day he knew a few words of english after all lacey walked with them back to the via del tritone they led him to a small gray fiat parked near the intersection renato gestured for him to get in the front lacey did so the arab got in behind the wheel renato sat in the back directly
herself unable to leave the house to see anyone i look hideous you do nt at all i do and with that she returns to bed for the day donald garland she tells me now is the kindest man she has ever known i was taken to lunch at his house mypfirst week in hong kong and we were the best of friends from then on we just adored each other the center of the table was strewn with orchids he d picked from his garden in my honor he said and the patio where we ate looked out over the crescent of repulse bay i was eighteen years old he must have been about fifty five my god donald is probably seventy i could never believe he was over so thrilled with everything he lived with the most easygoingand good natured american boy chips must have been about twenty six or seven then on the phone this afternoon donald told the most terrible news one morningtwo months ago chips died of an aneurysm at breakfast just keeled over dead donald took the body back to wilmington delaware and buried it and then he could nt leave he kept booking plane tickets and canceling now finally he s on his way home chips donald edgar brian colin i have no response to make no interrogations or cross examination nothing faintly resembling sympathy curiosity or interest or patience i had long ago heard all i could stand about the doings of the wealthy hong kong circle of english homosexuals who had adored her i exhibit only a churlish sort of surprise to find that i am to be a party to this very special reunion she shuts her eyes tightly as though to survive do nt talk to me like that do nt take that terrible tone he was my dearest friend he saved my life a hundred times and why did you risk it a hundred times but the interrogatory accusation and the terrible tone that goes with it i manage to squelch for by now even i know that i am being diminished far more by my anger at everything she does and did than by those ways of hers i ought to have learned to disregard or to have accepted with a certain grace long long ago only as the evening wears on and garland becomes increasingly spirited in his reminiscences do i wonder if she has invited him to the apartment so that i might learn at first hand just how very far from the apex she has fallen by insanely joining her fate to this fogy s whether or not that is her intention it is something like the result in their company i am no easygoing good natured chips to the crack of the whip and the swish of the cane in a vain attempt to force this pious sour censorious little prig out of my skin i try hard to believe that helen is simply showing this man who has meant so much to her and been so kind to her and who has himself just suffered a terrible blow that all is well in her life that she and her husband live comfortably and amicably and that her protector has nt to worry about her any longer yes helen is only acting as would any devoted daughter who wished to spare a doting father some harsh truth in short simple as the explanation for garland s presence might have seemed to someone else it is wholly beyond my grasp as though now that living with helen has ceased to make the least bit of sense i can not discover the truth about anything at seventy delicate small boned garland still does have a youthful sort of charm and a way is so fragile looking it seems it could be cracked with the tap of a spoon and his cheeks are the small round glazed cheeks of an alabaster cupid above the open shirt a pale silk scarf is tied around his neck almost completely hiding from view the throat whose creases are the only sign of his age in that strangely youthful face all there is to speak of sorrow are the eyes soft brown and awash with feeling even while his crisp accent refuses to betray the faintest hint of grief poor derek was killed you know helen did not know she puts her hand to her mouth but how derek she says turning to me was an associate in donald s firm a very silly man sometimes very muddled and so on but such a good heart really my dead expression sends her quickly back to garland yes he says he was a very kind person he could talk and go on but then you just had to tell him derek that s enough now and he d shut up well two chinese boys thought that he had nt given them enough money so they kicked him down a flight of stairs broke derek s neck how terrible how awful poor poor man and what asks helen has happened to all his animals the birds are gone some sort of virus wiped them out the week after he was killed the rest madge adopted madge adopted them and patricia looks after them otherwise those two wo nt have anything to do with each other again oh yes she can be a good bitch that madge when she wants to be chips did her house over for her a year ago she nearly drove the poor boy crazy with her upstairs bath helen tries yet again to explains that madge and patricia who own houses down along the bay from donald were stars of the british cinema in the forties donald rattles off the names of the movies they made i nod and nod just like an agreeable person but the smile i make apstab at presenting him does not begin to
enough kings said gamaliel drily he took me by the elbow but excuse me for being a negligent host let us go to the study where we can sip of persian wine and sit privately and talk he led me from the flowered atrium to a small room with windows overlooking the splendid palace of caiaphas and the palace of herod you have fine neighbors i said he smiled your father s house is but a short distance he coughed which reminds me that your mother is back i think you should call on her i looked up eagerly did she ask after me no but her coming back suggests that she would mend the wounds you but she is my mother my sense of grievance asserted itself he smiled even so does not your master preach that to forgive is to be forgiven i looked at him closely you have been following him his head inclined slowly since he was twelve it would appear but go to your mother promise me that i promised we reclined comfortably facing each other over a table laden with wines from many countries i would prefer a judean wine i said always the patriot judah well that is one request i can readily fulfill he looked up slowly the decanter poised over my cup is there any other request why i asked does the sanhedrin concern itself with so slight a matter as a healing at a healing pool he frowned it is not slight when you consider how sacred the pharisees hold the sabbath it was like restoring a life according to the law he had no right on the holy sabbath even to pick a plum from a tree but it was god s work the temple decides what is god s work and his eyes twinkled the sanhedrin decides the temple s work annas family runs the temple and the sanhedrin i had spoken too quickly and his red face reminded me soon enough of his position he went on quickly before i could apologize the sanhedrin is evenly divided between the sadducees and the pharisees and they are not quick to do annas bidding in all things they have convened at his request to question the blind man and his parents he held out a long finger but they have not called your jesus my curiosity was piqued and why is that because he has friends even in the sanhedrin of david and would know more about him before they pass judgment my eyes studied that shrewd jovial face not for naught did they call him the owl and they fear the thousands that follow him like the messiah i finished his thought who would if he gave the word take over the temple and the fortress antonia he chuckled in his beard he will never give the word for he thinks too much of israel i looked at him questioningly from all i hear he is a very wise man and wise men know there is a time and place for everything there was no point in discussing roman arms and roman might may any but the blind attend this hearing of josiah bartimaeus i asked he did not laugh with your credentials that should not be difficult my credentials are my secret true so observe as gamaliel s guest as one good then jesus will not be summoned not if the healing is deemed valid for it would be foolhardy to make an issue of the sabbath at this time against a popular hero he must be discredited first and that has not happened i was chilled by his cold logic so calculating it seemed evil i am just looking at the situation through annas eyes judah to achieve success one must concern himself not so much with what people say or do but with what they want now ask yourself what the old high priest wants to stay in power everybody knows that exactly so ask yourself what would undermine this power a rival power precisely and what else trouble with the romans he gave me an embrace you are indeed your father s son judah i had only mentioned the obvious but it is the approach to your master i am sure it would be illuminating but of course you are too close to him to be dispassionate and too influenced by wishful thinking he waved aside my objections i shall see you in the morning remember he cautioned you are but an observer as i left i realized that i had not touched my wine the court of the hewn stone where the sanhedrin met was nearly filled only a quorum of twenty three was necessary in lesser trials whereas in capital cases a majority of the seventy was usually required sessions were customarily held on two successive days to assure the accused the fullest opportunity to reverse the outcome of the first hearing as always the law was more merciful than man i saw many familiar faces in the chamber annas sat on a raised platform facing the tribunal and slightly below sat the nasi the reb gamaliel i took a seat in a back row of the by the nasi near the prisoner s dock i noticed nicodemus and joseph of arimathea quietly waiting for the proceedings to begin the charges were brought by the rabbi ezra but as the accuser he could not be a witness caiaphas the prosecutor took his place at the head of a long table two witnesses were necessary and since the accused was hardly a bona fide witness against himself i wondered who the others might be with a start i recognized the disciple cestus who i remembered now had been in the company t hat day he was my responsibility since i had named him and dysmas and joshua bar abbas as well after they had shown some interest in using this cloak to cover
the sound of another door opening and shutting and then a low mumble of voices the familiar sound of one of those voices caused a sinister expression to cross his dark face without hesitation he glided down the passage and crouched like a stalking panther beside the door it was not locked and manipulating it delicately he pushed it open a crack with a reckless disregard for possible consequences that only he could have explained or defended it was masked on the other side by tapestries but through a thin slit in the velvet he looked into a chamber lit by a candle on an ebony table there were two men in that chamber one was a scarred sinister looking ruffian in leather breeks and ragged cloak the other was tarascus king of nemedia tarascus seemed ill at ease he was slightly pale and he kept starting and glancing about him as if expecting and fearing to hear some he was saying he is deep in drugged slumber but i know not when he may awaken strange to hear words of fear issuing from the lips of tarascus rumbled the other in a harsh deep voice the king frowned i fear no common man as you well know but when i saw the cliffs fall at valkia i knew that this devil we had resurrected was no charlatan i fear his powers because i do not know the full extent of them but i know that somehow they are connected with this accursed thing which i have stolen from him it brought him back to life so it must be the source of his sorcery he had it hidden well but following my secret order a slave spied on him and saw him place it in a golden chest and saw where he hid the chest even so i would not have dared steal it had xaltotun himself not been sunk in lotus his power with it orastes brought him back to life with it he will make us all slaves if we are not wary so take it and cast it into the sea as i have bidden you and be sure you are so far from land that neither tide nor storm can wash it up on the beach you have been paid so i have grunted the ruffian and i owe more than gold to you king i owe you a debt of gratitude even thieves can be grateful whatever debt you may feel you owe me answered tarascus will be paid when you have hurled this thing into the sea i ll ride for zingara and take ship from kordava promised the other i dare not show my head in argos because of the matter of a murder or so i care not so it is done here it is a horse awaits something passed between them something that flamed like livingfire conan had only a brief glimpse of it and then the ruffian pulled a slouch hat over his eyes drew his cloak about his shoulder and hurried from the chamber and as the door closed behind him conan moved with the devastating fury of unchained blood lust he had held himself in check as long as he could the sight of his enemy so near him set his wild blood seething and swept away all caution and restraint tarascus was turning toward an inner door when conan tore aside the hangings and leaped like a blood mad panther into the room tarascus wheeled but even before he could recognize his attacker conan s poniard ripped into him but the blow was not mortal as conan knew the instant he struck his foot had caught in a fold of the curtains and tripped him as he leaped the point fleshed itself in tarascus s shoulder and plowed down along his ribs and the king of nemedia screamed body hurled him back against the table and it toppled and the candle went out they were both carried to the floor by the violence of conan s rush and the foot of the tapestry hampered them both in its folds conan was stabbing blindly in the dark tarascus screaming in a frenzy of panicky terror as if fear lent him superhuman energy tarascus tore free and blundered away in the darkness shrieking help guards arideus orastes orastes conan rose kicking himself free of the tangling tapestries and the broken table cursing with the bitterness of his blood thirsty disappointment he was confused and ignorant of the plan of the palace the yells of tarascus were still resounding in the distance and a wild outcry was bursting forth in answer the nemedian had escaped him in the darkness and conan did not know which way he had gone the cimmerian s rash stroke for vengeance had failed and there remained only the task of saving his own back down the passage and into the alcove glaring out into the lighted corridor just as zenobia came running up it her dark eyes dilated with terror oh what has happened she cried the palace is roused i swear i have not betrayed you no it was i who stirred up the hornet s nest he grunted i tried to pay off a score what s the shortest way out of this she caught his wrist and ran fleetly down the corridor but before they reached the heavy door at the other end muffled shouts arose from behind it and the portals began to shake under an assault from the other side zenobia wrung her hands and whimpered we are cut off i locked that door as i returned through it but they will burst it in in a moment the way to the postern gate lies through it conan wheeled up the corridor though still out of sight foes were behind as well as before him quick into this door the girl cried desperately running across the corridor and throwing
bless you we talked movie business for a time he sat listening staring down at his glas swilling the ice cubes round unnaturally deferential as if he would rather be chatting up the stewardess then he began to talk again about television its ephemerality the stupefying quantity of horse shit his own programmes involved it was a trauma or ordeal i had long been through myself the tyranny of the mass audience the need to suppress instinct education subtlety and a dozen other things in favour of the bedrock truth of the human condition tha the majority is ignorant and wants or at least pays money to be treated as a moron audiences are shmucks as a celebrated oh hollywood director once put it succinctly to me and shmucks hat brains then barney went on about the horrors of now bein recognized everywhere he went but no one walks into that blind all art from the finest poetry to the sleaziest strip show has the same clause written in you will henceforth entails still i felt some sympathy fon him and a certain wry amusement at finding myself in jenny s role now perhaps he sensed it we had a couple more whiskies and lx raised his glass well here s to caroline anyway he drank then said she seems to have survived the divorce pretty well by some miracle it s been nice getting to know her this last couple of years you probably did nt miss much speaking from bitter personal experience ii ve forgotten three boys the oldest wo nt speak to me the middle one ca nt and the youngest does he s the one i hate i ie d said that before no doubt in el vino s and beyond the epigram margaret s problem really i ve opted out i felt pretty much the me about my own old man they do nt bother to hide s progress i tried to remember margaret a small woman with a smile that i led too hard and who said nothing unless spoken to never seemed quite to want to be where she was she had nt been at oxford and i knew very little about her barney stared again down the cabin roll on the republic let some other poor bastard bring the little horrors up i m sorry my fault never enough time or the patience he took a breath and another mouthful of whisky then changed the subject you re coming back here as soon as no i ll finish the script at home he gave me one of his old smiles knowing and searching is it really home for you now england good lord yes i ve got a small farm down in devon caroline told me sounds nice we drifted then to the i shared doubts and disillusions grasped for apples turned to wax dreams become ashes but i would never have come out with that to him you can practise self deprecation and get away with it with those you love but not with those you despise i decided he was anxious that i should nt say too much about the past to caro he too wanted a favourable report he had problems he did nt take himself too seriously they started bringing round the meal and i used that my not having slept and not feeling hungry to break off the conversation ile was very anxious we should have lunch one day soon if i was in london i made the right noises then i lay down sleep came deep and dreamless like all slumbers of the damned tarquinia they had one golden period anthony heard of an empty flat in rome and the four of them spent six weeks in it during the high summer of the year that followed their last as the academic sense anthony was now teaching at worcester and dan was stage managing at the playhouse on a pittance and really living on the eight hundred a year he had inherited anthony and jane had married in december she was four months pregnant by the time they went to rome their wedding had been formal and formidable with a full panoply of relatives dan was best man jane had been officially received into the church a month previously in the new year they moved into a cottage at wytham dan and nell had had a much simpler registry office ceremony as soon as nell had taken her finals and rome was their token honeymoon a year before dan would not have believed it possible that he could go through with such an arrangement but much had changed in the interval he would have liked not to see jane for weeks after their acte gratuit but that very next afternoon he was working in his room when she appeared with anthony it happened so fast no time to dread the meeting their names as the discoverers of the corpse whose murderer was never found were already in the morning newspapers anthony seemed wrily amused wanted to hear dan s side of it he had to be treated normally as nell already that day had had to be treated normally she knew he was cramming and had arrived just after breakfast on her bicycle on her way to her first lecture she had been easy to deceive she showed no suspicion merely a shocked excitement so ghastly so extraordinary their idyllic little cut he found he could look at jane without embarrassment he even felt a belated pity for anthony and discovered how easy it was to pull wool over trusting eyes and began to condone himself it had been a comedy a ten minutes madness he felt himself running away already devaluing the reality even comparing jane physically to nell telling himself he really preferred nell he was nt to go to the bathroom and they were left alone it was a warm day she was
i m already married he snapped his fingers it completely slipped my mind she put her knife and fork down and playfully lunged at him pushing his shoulders to the grass and pinning them there michelle smiled i do nt know i have nt thought that far ahead well i have he kissed her tasting the pella on her breath and reached for the zipper at the back of her blouse let me help she said he nodded and she rolled to the side they undressed in silence the light from the fire creating shadows that danced among the trees the night air felt warm against their naked bodies hans lay on his back with her head on his chest but for some reason his thoughts were elsewhere shattered specks of light pierced the heavens he stared into the sky made out the constellation orion and tried to distinguish the colors of its four perimeter stars failing he closed his eyes and listened to the interminable silence of the dark hunter who seemed somehow to be trying to tell him something what s the matter michelle asked nothing are you shoulder and silently ran her nails along his spine she really did nt care if he told her what was on his mind or not her assignment was not to understand him not to extract information from him but to keep him occupied away from his apartment in the heart of cyprus away from his radio transmitter away from the message he should have been receiving pressure built in hans s ears and he felt the landing gear lock into position preparing for arrival he took the white plastic coffee cup off the tray in front of him and handed it to a passing stewardess how soon are we due in frankfurt he asked her we ll be landing at rein main field in seven minutes he thought about the ever punctilious germans it would not do for a lufthansa stewardess to say five minutes or ten minutes when the precise figure was seven three weeks had passed since hans was ordered to liquidate his if he was to be reassigned immediately he supposed he was agents simply were not presented with vacations or sabbatical leaves not that he minded he could nt think of anything he would want to do with time off there was a ping above his head he fastened his seatbelt and sank deeper into the cushion he lacked any feeling of well being now that the cyprus operation was over he thought only of the next mission karl richtman met hans at the terminal quickly ush ered him into a small beige mercedes c then sped out of the airport accelerating rapidly onto the autobahn hans knew the route well it was a short six miles along the main river to the city where are you taking me hans asked as they raced through the wooded german countryside nowhere i m just going to drive long enough to make sure you were nt followed then i ll head back to the airport you have a flight hesitated before asking the next question where am i going richtman looked sideways at him you re going home hans s face bore no expression of the emotion he felt for how long i have nt been told he paused for a moment would you like it to be permanent hans looked out at the tree lined highway tall cypresses bent and straightened in the breeze i do nt know i have nt given the idea much thought there is a limit to how long one can stay out there i ve been in germany for two years and i can hardly wait to get home you must he tired not too tired hans snapped i did nt mean that richtman said apologetically hans sensed that he did we just heard there was some trouble on cyprus is anyone following us richtman looked into the rear view mirror the all clear signal good richtman swung the mercedes off the autobahn and proceeded to the airport via a secondary highway a strained silence separated the two men as the car darted through the traffic finally hans turned and placed his hand on karl s shoulder i m sorry if i was short with you but you hit me with quite a surprise it s been awhile since i was home richtman smiled i understand it must be a long time since you ve seen your wife three years and then it was only for a month it s rough you know i missed my son s graduation from the university richtman paused for a moment maybe men like us have no right to marry hans did nt respond as they parked in front of the departure terminal richtman reached into his coat pocket give me your hans hoffmann papers and i ll give you your own passport richtman extended across the seat holding it in his hand he fingered the gold embossed letters on the vinyl cover you have nt forgotten who you are richtman said jokingly no major ari ben sion of the mossad haelion lemodiin ubitachon his country s supreme intelligence agency slipped his israeli passport into his coat pocket and headed for the el al departure lounge as the boeing inched its way over the aegean sea ari took a final sip of his j b then lay back and closed his eyes there was so much to think about so many loose ends to tie up in israel but he preferred not to deal with any of that before he landed he would sort out his life later now he would sleep he was jarred awake as the tires locked into position below the wings banged down on the concrete runway the plane surged forward in the air bounced and began to slow with out the window ari saw that the lettering over the terminal read
could live in his place and make good a few clay promises after all i feel almost religious about going back up there and seeing what i can make of it ah in that be it from me to tamper with any more creative spirits much less a religious impulse no violet i m not making fun of you i really hope you make it for several years after ambrose left and you and i had that polite luncheon at schrafft s i would check the gallery ads every sunday in the times every week i d steel myself for the sight of your name in one of those little squares i had mixed feelings i wanted you to make it but i was bitter because i would no longer have a share in your happiness i had hoped the three of us would be a sort of family well let me tell you something if and when the day comes that i do see your name my feelings wo nt be mixed anymore both of us buried something up there today i buried my resentment there was a lot of it but she put her hand on mine i really think her touched by her candor i was half tempted to say i had changed my mind about the lobster salad and wine but just then we entered the lincoln tunnel and as the tiled walls yellowish in the underground light sped monotonously past i felt the old inertia lurking even now in the edges of my resolve i did nt trust myself in carol s territory with a full stomachunquickening my blood and a good wine displacing gravity with effervescence in my head i would sit there in her well appointedspace the relics of her family s solidity and what her own industry had added grouped round us like testimonials and i might begin to doubt the solidity of that little cabin shimmering as i had first seen it in its equal mixture of sun and shadow it represented my vision of what might still be done but it waspa frail and fledgling vision balanced precariously between the practical and the ideal the least tipping of my attitude toward skepticism or sloth could render it into her gucci bag here s my card so you wo nt have the excuse of not knowing where to reach me i d like it so much if you d just call every now and then i ll write i wo nt have a phone up there you really are going are nt you well i wish you luck will you keep in touch i have a genuine curiosity about what will happen to you i ll write then promise i promise she leaned over and laid her cool cheek against mine she still wore such nice perfume oh and do nt forget your times arriving in plommet falls this morning she had presentedit to me folded open to ambrose s obituary as modestly as if it had been her own gift it s placed well people can see it she said now studying it possessively of course day even when compressed into two paragraphs he manages to come out looking glamorous does nt he between friendsit was late friday afternoon exactly one week since ambrose s suicide had put the finishing touch on my day of lost options as i d come to think of it i was sitting in milo s garden sketch ing his brilliant array of late summer flowers with my new set of marvy markers their forty eight colors listed on the inside of the box in four languages i had gone a bit wild at the art supplyshop the day before following my success at having sublet my apartment to three members of a mime troupe i do nt much like the idea of three grumbled the landlord oh but they ll be as quiet as one i d assured him that s their profession three young hopefuls full of enthusiasm for everything to do with new york they had padded on tensed dancers legs from a girl with thick flowing hair to her waist and two boys a couple and their friend the couple bought the double bed jake and i had occupied i hoped our old animosities would not haunt them the boy would make his bedroom in my old studio to him i sold a table a chair and the studio couch from the living room they bought the dishes and rugs as well they wrote me out checks still drawn on a bank in urbana illinois we ll take any work we can get till we get established they explained the girl was excited because she was pretty sure she had got a job doing a shampoo commercial i had mailed myselfthree boxes of art supplies care of minerva means and managed to compress nine years worth of accumulations into two portable bulks my stereo and record collection as well as a dozen or so paintings not bad enough to throw away but not good enough to live in a one room cabin with with me on the morning bus to plommet falls milo was watering his flowers his form hovered so gracefully over a cluster of brilliant dahlias that i had half a mind to include him in the composition in the late afternoon light he looked like some serene gold dappled ascetic in a pisanello but if i remained true to the hard hot hued flowers i would render him pale and insubstantial on the other hand if i set my mind to capturing his ethereal grace the flowers would appear gaudy in contrast no milo was more of a watercolor than a marvy marker composition and having decided i put a rich splotch of magenta right where the loose flowing line of his creamy shirted rib cage would otherwise have gone ha i said consulting the multilingual color chart
the broad shore s back the rocks like the knobs of its spine it was turning into one of those days on which the sun not hot showed itself through clenched openings in the clouds winter was over madeline led the way up the ledge to a gaunt outcropping of earth she climbed it and then faced back briefly to wave at brady he was having trouble making the climb his shoes kept slipping on the stone by the time he achieved the pinnacle she was gone a path led into a thicket of brambles and the low scrub pine that thrives in the sandy soil by the ocean in new england he followed it the fog had entirely lifted and the last mist was burned away there were little globules of moisture on the branches and small leaves of the undergrowth but one could almost see them evaporating had to have gone this way he thought and so continued along the path it wound past a high chicken wire fence that was nearly grown over brady stopped to examine it and discerned in the brambles and shrubs the ruins of a tennis court i used to play here he heard her voice before he saw her she was standing inside the viny fence in the middle of the overgrown court the baseline would have been here she toed the dirt and the net she looked wistfully around whose place is it phillipses the sanford phillipses friends of my parents i d forgottentheir place was here it seems ancient like the ruins of pompeii but a tennis court can return to the wild in a matter of years it is ancient that was years ago i feel very old suddenly she made her way toward him drew very close mortality of playgrounds colman said absently colman i need some reassurance they stared at each other through the fence not moving then as if on cue they began going along the opposite sides of the fence gaining momentum as they went slapping brush and branches out of the way soon they were practically running side by side the wire between them they embraced in the gate madeline was weeping as brady looked over her shoulder onto the old tennis court he suddenlysaw the scene as it had been twenty five years before young people beautiful tan perfect in their whites the two boys in flannel trousers the two girls in pleats they were playing a vigorous match madeline gardner was serving thwapp her racquet drove the ball deep into the service box forcing the young man to skip backward and flick weakly at the ball which arched back across the net graceful lunge she smashed it back at him he never had a chance game one hollered set great madeline approached the net she kissed her opponent on the mouth her lips were wet let s go get loaded her partner threw his arm around her shoulders as they headed off the court toweling themselves madeline let her right hand rest casually on his buttocks her thumb hooked in his trousers pocket brady felt her hand on his own buttocks she was pressing kneading exciting him immeasurably i know a place she said brady nodded and let her take him by the hand they walked in silence along an overgrown path there madeline thomson said pointing to a great stone mansion on a spit of land the ocean crashed around it on two sides the phillips house just for us the mansion struck no roots in the sand great rock ledges that guarded against the breakers a precarious place colman thought all too exposed perhaps there s someone there he cautioned no not yet she set out across the high grass still pulling him it was the simplicity of her stride he envied she had no thought that she trespassed he watched the windows on the second and third floors expecting curtains to be parted but there was no movement the windows on the first floor were covered with cracked rectangles of wood the color of seaweed the building itself was a compound of stones and beams they entered a modest courtyard formed on one side by a row of garages on another by a detached cottage and on the third by the house itself brady s initial impression of the fragility of the place held despite its massive stateliness little mortar was discernible between the large random shaped rocks and the mansion seemed to be an achievement more of balance than construction nodding at the cottage but otherwise ignoring it she fixed her attention on the main entrance which she approached confidently she tried to open it damn locked of course it s locked should the proprietor have left the place open all winter for the sake of their early spring tryst my parents never locked their house at vineyard haven times were different then dearie and vineyard haven is nt gloucester madeline slammed her fist against the door which solid oak barely registered the blow oh damn she turned and slumped against the lintel and looked at brady she seemed a petulant defied child her mouth fixed in a showy pout brady leaned both his hands on the wood by her ears you give the appearance of being a very competent person she gave him a look of such unfettered trust that he felt a pang as if he were misreading it or unworthy said i m not he kissed her brushing her teeth with his tongue let s see what we can do he said he took her hand and led the way back to the courtyard he approached the servants cottage now the determined self assurance was in his stride not hers the cottage window was not boarded over brady cupped his free hand and peered in there was a chaos of furniture which seemed to have been brought in from some porch wicker chairs a chaise
void zero gee could only be tolerated for so long in a stretch then weight became essential to health under continuous boost reaction mass would presently give out so it would be necessary to put a spin on the ship with a large radius in order to minimize centrifugal variations and coriolis effect foreseeing that need as a possibility designers had included provisions against it when they worked out their modifications of the reina class the hull could be split in two its forward and after halves separated that involved a lot of work only part of which could be done by explosive seams but the capability was there a cable of whisker filaments for the tensile strength would connect them still under the impetus of the lateral jets they d motors would set them rotating earth normal pseudogravity would thereafter prevail inboard the cable would carry power from the reactor to the living quarters and another wheel would go whirling off through space another prison brodersen grimaced not for the first time at the prospect of carrying out such a job with his inadequate crew it was a sizzling hell of a lot more complicated than it sounded merely balancing masses in the hemispheres let alone scrambling around outside in spacesuits we ll do it though somehow if we must he vowed and junk that rattlebrain word prison huh pegeen will be here to die at last he made a gesture of thrusting away and hauled his attention outward the cylinder gleamed near he wondered how it felt to joelle and fidelio perceiving directly through the instruments while they piloted the vessel through forces that negated space time he d never know that experience lay beyond words it was mystical maybe transmystical he d better they themselves had no idea what they would emerge into what they might instantly have to understand and do and here comes the beacon hard off our port bow the siren whooped warning the hull swung about and plunged chinook passed through first he stared wildly around after a t machine the heart drummed in his breast he saw it afar a staff laid across blackness and the breath gusted from him in a shout next he grew aware of how much blackness there was no stars shone behind that rod well nigh every line of sight was empty of all but night inpone burned a lurid blue white spark at the middle of a pearly haze which spread out on either side like wings elsewhere well apart he discerned faint points of light and a few small cloudy glows motors off the ship fell silent through the dark my god brodersen mumbled where are we action snapped to life in him report by stations shaken voices told him nobody had come to harm yet joelle spoke last as if in dreams fidelio and i think we know already what s happened it is very strange abruptly machine like we need more data accelerate at about forty five degrees to our present radius vector around that sun you see inward commence the planned observational programs and be prepared for further instructions aye aye brodersen said a small part of him wondered why his obedience was so automatic the joelle he recalled who liked him and indulged his wish for her company even for what little of her knowledge he could comprehend but always remained at heart aloof she was no more what he had embraced a few nightwatches ago was an oldish woman yes spinsterish pathetically eager for him at first then wistful in her stiff fashion and helpless looking after she fell asleep since she d busied herself discussing most of her spare time in her cabin and been short spoken at mess embarrassed he speculated though he could nt figure out why she should be however her brain is still good and right now it s enhanced beyond my poor imagining weight returned brodersen knew at least a trio of grounds for building up speed doppler measurements improved sampling of ambient conditions such as solar wind cameras detecting planets as streaks across the background of the stars but where are the stars this system holds nothing for us until sure that everything was okay he ought to stay put in the command center however unless an emergency came up he was supernumerary he fiddled with controls and peered at meters trying to learn what he might the blue white fierceness which joelle had called a sun was really brilliant the optics stopped its radiance way down it was giving chinook illumination comparable to what sol gives earth but even at high magnification the disc showed tiny selective scanning and amplification he managed to find a lesser companion yellow nearly lost in the glare the fuzzy patches scattered around heaven turned out to contain points of light enmeshed in luminous mist and intricate filaments they must be orion type nebulae close by where new suns were forming out of dust and gas as he watched for the most part what had appeared to be individual stars were in fact star clusters widely separated reports from the astrolab started arriving beyond range of ordinary viewscreens but plentiful within the reach of the observatory equipment were more nebulae in a particular direction was a huge region invisible to the eye violently radiating in the infra red and radio wavelengths throughout the entire sky was no trace of the familiar external galaxies though it held sources of similar radiation more and more of these results as the hours wore on were reached under fidelio s management he told the humans what to look for and they found it he place chinook had gotten into brodersen puffed his pipe he believed he could guess the answer himself it boomed through him like the toning of a great bell su being co opted to do scutwork for the researchers caitlin was preparing dinner solo hitherto no one had
it he probably thought that women gave birth as easily as ewes she decided he was oblivious to the pain of contractions and that awful impossible stretching and the soreness afterward and the bossy know it all nurses who did nt want you to touch your baby because you were nt brisk and efficient and trained and sterile like they were he just saw you go away pregnant and come back with a beautiful white wrapped call him jonathan they added alfred for david s father and malcolm for lucy s and thomas for old tom but they called the boy jo because he was too tiny for jonathan let alone jonathan alfred malcolm thomas rose david learned to give him his bottle and burp him and change his diaper and he even dangled him in his lap occasionally but his interest seemed distant uninvolved he had a problem solving approach like the nurses it was not for him as it was for lucy tom was closer to the baby than david lucy would not let him smoke in the room where the baby was and the old boy would put his great briar pipe with the lid in his pocket for hours and gurgle at little jo or watch him kick his feet or help lucy bathe him lucy suggested mildly that he might be neglecting the sheep tom said they did not need him to watch them feed he would rather watch jo feed it with small round pebbles and was overjoyed when jo grabbed it and shook it first time without having to be shown how david and lucy still did not make love first there had been his injuries and then she had been pregnant and then she had been recovering from childbirth but now the reasons had run out one night she said i m back to normal now how do you mean after the baby my body is normal i ve healed oh i see that s good eye of the needle she made sure to go to bed with him so that he could watch her undress but he always turned his back as they lay there dozing off she would move so that her hand or her thigh or her breast brushed against him a casual but unmistakable invitation there was no response she believed firmly that there was nothing wrong with her simply want sex she wanted sex with david she was sure that even if there had been another man under seventy on the island she would not have been tempted she was nt a sex starved tart she was a love starved wife the crunch came on one of those nights when they lay on their backs side by side both wide awake listening to the wind outside and the small sounds of jo from the next room it seemed to lucy that it was time he either did it or came right out and said why not and that he was going to avoid the issue until she forced it and that she might as well force it now so she brushed her arm across his thighs and opened her mouth to speak and almost cried out with shock to discover that he had an erection so he could do it and he wanted to or why else and her hand closed triumphantly around the evidence of his desire and she shifted closer he said oh for god s sake and gripped her wrist and pushed her hand away from him and turned onto his side but this time she was not going to accept his rebuff in modest silence david why not jesus christ he threw the blankets off swung himself to the floor grabbed the eiderdown with one hand and dragged himself to the door lucy sat up in bed and screamed at him why not jo began to cry david pulled up the empty legs of his cut off pajama trousers pointed to the pursed white skin of his stumps and said that s why not that s why not he slithered downstairs to sleep on the sofa and lucy went into the next bedroom to comfort jo it took a long time to lull him back to sleep probably because she herself was so much in need of comfort the baby tasted the tears on her cheeks inkling of their meaning would nt tears be one of the first things a baby came to understand she could not bring herself to sing to him or murmur that everything was all right so she held him tight and rocked him and when he had soothed her with his warmth and his clinging he went to sleep in her arms she put him back in the cot and stood looking at him for a while there was no point in going back to bed she could hear david s deep sleep snoring from the living room he had to take powerful pills otherwise the old pain kept him awake lucy needed to get away from him where she could neither see nor hear him where he could nt find her for a few hours even if he wanted to she put on trou sers and a sweater a heavy coat and boots and crept down stairs and out there was a swirling mist damp and bitterly cold the kind the island coat thought about going back inside for a scarf and de cided not to she squelched along the muddy path welcom ing the bite of the fog in her throat the small discomfort of the weather taking her mind off the larger hurt inside her she reached the cliff top and walked gingerly down the steep narrow ramp placing her feet carefully on the slip pery boards at the bottom she jumped off on to the sand and walked to the edge of the sea the wind and the water were carrying on their perpetual
anyway i want you to check her out eban everything start back at the supermarket did she see much of jordon while she was still working there was there gossip was there someone she confided in understand how about this stanley guy asked mclure now he threatened him according to gore we ve got to pick him up of course and no we do nt hugh said jennings we ve got him something else a little while ago and they told me they found him on fairbanks street fast asleep in his car drunk as a skunk one of the residents notified the police and they took him in he s sleeping it off in a cell right now good so that leaves only the young fellow billy put out an all points on him let s see if we can get it on the early evening news make it plain that he s not a suspect just that we re interested in information that he might give jennings wrote in his notebook and then looked up inquiringly anything else hugh yeah go on home and get yourself a decent meal i ll see you at the stationhouse afterward since rabbi small did not turn on either the radio or on the sabbath it was not until he arrived at the temple for the evening service that he heard about the murder the dozen lot less observant of the sabbath than the rabbi and hence knew all about it most of them were listening to julius rottenberg who was a maven that is an expert in matters criminological by virtue of operating a coffee shop just outside the law courts in the neighboring city of lynn and who therefore was on intimate terms with the district attorney coffee and a cruller and heavy on the cream the assistant d a s all the cops and even the presiding judge tea with lemon and a little extra hot water julius it s the kid of course he was saying when the rabbi entered the chapel where they were waiting to begin the service fat and bald and normally with a perpetual eager smile julius now showed a fine high scorn for someone who had suggested that it could be some stranger from his past who had shot ellsworth jordon nah he said with an impatient sweep it gives them an out see but it was the kid that did it he s crazy about guns all kids are what do you expect with all these westerns on the tube and the gang pictures too he pinches the gun out of the bank where he works to hold up somebody or even to fire it in the woods nah just to fondle it to practice a quick draw maybe or twirling it around his finger like the gunmen do in the westerns so the old man catches him with it and makes him put it down and sends him to his room then everybody leaves there was some sort of dinner party and the old man sits down in his easy chair to grab himself forty winks so they re all alone and the old man is asleep so the kid leaves his room to get another look at the gun to hold it and wave it around and it goes sure so he figures he might as well get hanged for a sheep as for a lamb so he fires away until the gun is empty and when he s finished jordon is dead yeah but why did nt jordon jump up and stop him julius julius nodded with pompous solemnity good question my theory is that the old man panicked and froze a new arrival announced hey guys i just heard that the cops arrested stanley stanley our stanley what for i do nt know all i heard was he was arrested did you see him around today he was nt here last night either look in the vestry and you ll see all the stuff from the collation the dirty dishes they re still on the table you think we ought to clean up that s the house committee s business throughout the service the he performed perfunctorily even the havdala ceremony that divided the sabbath from the rest of the week what kept running through his head was that if jordon was dead and if henry maltzman had been right about him then the temple might now be able to buy the adjoining land for the religious school a little ashamed of his thoughts and his inability to concentrate on the prayers the rabbi did not stand around and talk with the members of the minyan at the conclusion of the service as he usually did but excused himself and went right home he had no sooner entered the house when the phone rang rabbi small he announced from the other end came a hoarse chuckle i figured you d be getting home right about now rabbi stanley that s right i m down at the stationhouse and they said i could make a phone call you mean you ve been arrested what for what s the little drunk all right i ll be down and talk with them the desk sergeant looked at rabbi small doubtfully and said gee i do nt know rabbi you re not a lawyer are you i mean you do nt have a law degree do you no because he s got a right to see his lawyer of course but i do nt know about anybody else i guess it would be all right if you were his spiritual advisor but stanley not being jewish his spiritual advisor would have to be a minister or a priest depending on if he was catholic or protestant see what i mean i mean just because he works at your temple would nt make you his spiritual advisor and your not being a lawyer

a little bit like peddling you re showing excellent judgment what about ambassador to the u n do nt make me laugh what do you think about secretary of the treasury gold pricked up his ears what what would i have to do i think i could find out harris rosenblatt would know most of them are very rich and seem to care about money i care about money but they know about it gold declined with regret i m not sure i d be comfortable i msupposed to be something of a pacifist and a radical reformer but a conservative radical reformer bruce ralph reminded that s true imagine what a blessing it might be to have you in the department of defense gold had an inspiration how about secretary of defense that s good bruce especially for a pacifist but i m only a pacifist in times of peace we ll put it clown ralph added to his list and then there s head of the fbi or ia to consider would i believe so and wrote those down too these are all good bruce someone with your flair for publicity could probably get your name in the newspapers almost as often as the secretary of state what about secretary of state asked gold that s a thought said ralph would nt i have to know anything absolutely not ralph answered and appeared astounded that gold even should ask in government bruce experience does nt count and knowledge is nt important if there s one lesson of value to be learned from the past bruce it s to grab what you want when the chance comes to get it gold asked with distress is that good for the world nothing s good for the world bruce i thought you knew that you ve more or less said the same in that last piece of yours now bruce ralph continued awkwardly i have better wife than belle gold was elated i m sorry ralph was solemn belle would be okay for labor or agriculture but not for secretary of state or defense belle and i have not been close gold confided in that case i m happy said ralph try someone tall this time bruce you re rather short you know it would add to your stature if you had a tall wife would nt a tall wife make me look smaller inquired gold no said ralph you would make her look taller and that would add more to your stature and make her look smaller andrea conover would be perfect i m seeing her tonight is she tall enough oh easily and her father is a dying career diplomat with tons of money and the best connections propose tonight nt seen her for seven years so what ralph laughed back in encouragement you can always get a divorce andrea s doing a great job with the oversight committee on government expenditures she s the reason wepca nt make personal phone calls any more you know bruce gold rose when ralph did these are really our golden years that period when men like us are appealing to all classes of women between sixteen and sixty five i hope you re making the most of them a lot of them go for your kind my kind whatever currents of euphoria had been coursing through gold s veins congealed yes said ralph what do you mean by my kind gold asked ralph the kind of person you are bruce why as opposed to what other kinds ralph the kinds of person you are nt bruce why do you ask and then decided to take the inky plunge lieberman thinks you re anti semitic ralph was stunned me his voice was hurt and astonished bruce i would feel just awful if i thought i ever did or said a single thing to give you that impression ralph was sincere and gold was contrite you have nt ralph i m sorry i brought it up thank you bruce ralph was placated and his handsome face fairly shone with grace when he grinned why i copied your papers at columbia you practically put me through graduate school it s just that i really do nt feel lieberman is an especially nice person he is nt gold laughed and i ve known him all my life the strain gone ralph said let me take these notes to dusty and have her type them up we ve really covered a lot of ground today but never in his lifetime had he felt more sanguine about his prospects he glanced out the window at official washington and caught a glimpse of heaven through the doorway the view of the open office space was a soothing pastoral with vistas of modular desks dozing tranquilly under indirect fluorescentlighting that never flickered there were shoulder high partitions of translucent glass other offices across the way as imposingas ralph s and the dreamlike stirrings of contented

of the egyptians and the hebrews jeremiah ezekiel elijah deborah spiritual jewels were often sent and raiment of silk and velvet wine and fruit homely items such as brooms and wreaths of bright flowers gifts of love and humility came down and golden chains and trumpets and silver swords all of these were received through certain sisters and so today sister phebe waited in the ministers apartment next to the meeting hall and those without waited too for their christmas gift from the world beyond at into the shape of a heart and covered with fine script as if she were walking in her sleep she passed unseeing into the center of the room in a high clear voice she began to read beloved i send you this day my best love and my choicest gifts a basket of cakes of love a silver chalice filled with the water of life raiment of strength and comfort a flock of white doves to bring you peace as she read the family listened with rapt attention like well trained actors in a play they followed the cues which sister phebe read to them pantomiming they passed around the basket and each took her or his portion of the love they drank from the silver chalice they adorned themselves with the silken shawls and golden crowns how generous was mother ann how deeply solicitous of their welfare an onlooking gentile might see nothing might mock their credulity but they believed they ate and as if it had been palpable in their hands as perhaps it was finally sister phebe paused as if for dramatic effect they understood that she had something more to tell them they waited all expectant muted excitement filled the room with an almost palpable tension tell us they begged although not a word was heard what is your message mother ann in little more than three years time said sister phebe will come a revolution it will be a political revolution and therefore none of your affair but mark it well for it will be the signal for the millennium far away across the sea men will fight each other you will hear of it for some of the defeated will find their way to you welcome them and remember what i have said they strained to hear to understand what had revolution to do with them the millennium she had promised such prophecies often weeks before the news arrivedfrom france and they had heard of that wonderful new invention the telegraph long before anyone in the world save morse himself had dreamed of such a thing so now they listened to this latest revelation with perfect confidence that it would come true sister phebe stood silent before them her head bowed her hands clasping the fine scrawled paper then her rigid form swayed slightly like a sapling in a gust of wind her knees gave way and she coiled gracefully to the floor three brothers gently lifted her and carried her to the retiring room the meeting ended with a hymn of thanks to mother ann and then elder james opened a barrel of choice apples each took one as the companymarched out to the dining hall for christmas dinner sabra bit into the sweet crisp flesh of the fruit she felt the cold air on her face the bright landscape hurting her eyes these things were real the hardpacked snow beneath her feet the tears in were what she knew what she understood she had not understood what had passed in meeting she had prayed with the others but she had been unable in good conscience to pantomime the receiving of the spiritual gifts she had not known that such things happened in the united society messages from the spirit world had not been part of the bargain i can accept it all she thought the work the isolation from the world the prayers and dances and hymns but mesmerism and the belief in spirits no that i can not christmas dinner was a bounteous feast sister ruth and her helpers might have been accused of the sin of pride had anyone been mean enough to carp but all were gratefully hungry and as each new dish appeared from the kitchen it as quickly disappeared into the mouths of the faithful they ate oyster cream soup and stuffed turkey and chestnut pudding ginger beets and pumpkin bread and white bread and herb bread applesauce rose hip jam apple pie mincemeat pie cranberry pie plum jelly turnovers fruitcake and gingerbread afterward they knelt and gave special thanks this day for all their blessings that evening there were union meetings in the dormitories sabra came in late from her visit to clara as she slipped into her chair she felt the comfortable atmosphere in the room the quiet talk the easy chuckles the warm and friendly interest of brothers and sisters each for all she saw brother william but philornena although she had been recovered some days since was not among the sisters but of course not they would not be permitted to attend a union meeting together for a long time months even years brother william spoke easily to a sister opposite him sabra did not know her name his face was unsmiling but he seemed calm and self possessed she remembered philomena s torture pher agonized words of confession had brother william undergone a similar torment him words suddenly came into her mind she could not remember where she had read them he for god and she for god in him but it was so there was always that impediment even shaker women seeking god had first to put men out of their hearts welcome the stranger said mother ann for he will be your friend they obeyed her in this as in all else and the more visitors who came to inspect them the more they saw the wisdom of her words for strangers who came
had intensified and different growing things had pushed forward their warm scents something within her had begun to throb his hand hunting under her gown had found the throbbing place the protecting thong around her thighs seemingly had loosened and she had twisted about as if refusing this personal invasion but the earth had sided with the man pressing as hard against her back as pesla now on top had pressed against her front she had blinked open her eyes the next instant he had flung up her gown half her body exposed to his gaze and then she had learned the strength of his arms he had pulled her on top himself up to his mouth where he had tasted her for sweetness rolling her back on the ground he had spread her legs and so she had discovered the strength of his hands and then she had known hardness and push and pain all in the same moment she had seemed floating away unknowing where and so she had shed a tear stars had drifted past each tiny bright sun beyond her reach she had tried once and again to touch even one and when they all had disappeared she had laughed a crazy little laugh the air had seemed filled with a strange new fragrance something more than flower smell more than creature smell and gazing up at the dark heads of the tree people she had touched her own face and hair she had seen where pesla lay as if asleep she had reached out her hand and touched him touched something wet and sticky that now belonged to her the man feeling her touch had smiled not opening his eyes he had reached over his hand and touched where his hardness had visited her touched something wet and warm that now belonged to him and so the warrior had made lowansa his wife these two had not returned at once to the encampment instead they had gone visiting among the sicangu the woman s relatives welcoming the pair in their lodges gifting this man and wife with robes and hides and meat and a horse and drag for carrying back these gifts to the titonwan hoop everywhere they went pesla had appeared eager to keep his wife within sight lowansa seventeen had worn a colorful tie around her gown something to show off her pleasingly wide hips below a small waist and fully ripe breasts her shape and pretty face certain to attract glances even so custom permitted crude joking between pesla and certain ones among his new affinal relatives jokes that had led to much teasing laughing the son of ogle had displayed a remarkably good nature and lowansa seeing none of the frightful temper he had turned on the horse had begun to wish that pesla stay with the sicangu that they raise a lodge here on the earth smoke then suddenly pesla had spoken the warrior saying that they shall start back they had lived away from the mahto camp from round moon to round moon and so the next day the two had begun traveling north the ihoka lodge had given a feast for pegla and his wife upon their return and the pair had received a tipi cover along with many different gifts and so lowansa had everything she had wanted for a lodge from backrests even a bone backrest for pesla to painted containers perhaps enough meat folders and robe holders for the next two three winters joyfully the young parents then waited for pala to bring his little girl the daughter of his dead wife into her lodge but he had not brought the child when she had asked for a reason he had answered saying you will give me a son and perhaps a daughter let the girl stay in my mother s lodge he had mentioned his mother s apparent pleasure in her grandchild and he had told of the many ways this little one resembled the small daughter who had died choking lowansa had not dared say more soon the young woman had discovered that her husband stayed easy to live with only when things went entirely his way but let him lose his meat during the chase or hear someone dispute one of his schemes and then his anger boiled as on the day he had whipped the horse a glare in his eyes and a growl in his throat certainly she had endeavored to please him her grandmother and mother had taught her that a wife shall accept the husband s man asks that a certain woman becomes his wife custom gives that woman the privilege of refusing for her own reasons but once she accepts a man she accepts his nature and without intent of making change neither in the man nor in the child who shall bear a piece if not the whole of his nature lowansa had noticed also that pesla s most disagreeable moods came after he attended a meeting in the ihoka lodge in some mysterious way these clubmen had a way of arousing his surliness the woman had made a true observation the man returned from each gathering of the ihoka in a temper that invariably upset the tipi they had not promoted him to the rank he desired rattle carrier club owner lance bearer he had held those ranks in the tokala and he intended to hold a more impressive place among the ihoka they used his wife as one of their singers and they had honored him with many gifts yet at the feasts he sat alongside the ordinary members and they had refused agreeable to painting exactly as he painted to walk in the ihoka procession he needed to find one person willing to imitate him this rule and one more rule the ihoka emphasized the members shall live as brothers none quarreling nor giving reason for a quarrel they had hinted more than once that pella especially
he s just done find him report your progress hourly to this office congdon sat down angrily replacing the phone with such force that it jarred the bell he stared at the instrument picked it up and dialed again overseas communications miss andros said the woman s voice miss cipher specialist to my office immediately classification code a maximum security and priority an emergency sir yes miss andros an emergency the cable will be sent in thirty minutes clear all traffic to amsterdam marseilles and prague scofield heard the footsteps in the hallway and got out of the chair he walked to the door and peered through the tiny disk in the center the figure of a man passed by he did not stop at the door across the way the entrance to the suite of rooms used by taleniekov s courier bray went back to the chair and sat down he leaned his head against the rim staring at the ceiling it had been three days since the race in the streets three nights since he d taken the messenger from taleniekov messenger three nights ago killer on the unter den linden ten years before it had been a strange night an odd race a finish that might have been otherwise kill him had gradually lost its urgency for bray as so much had lost urgency the courier had brought it upon himself the soviet had gone into panic and pulled out a four inch razor sharp blade from the recesses of the hotel chair and attacked his death was due to scofield s reaction it was not the premeditated murder planned in the street nothing ever changed much the kgb courier had been used by taleniekov the man was convinced that beowulf agate was coming over and the russian who brought him in would be given the brassiest medal in moscow you ve been tricked bray had told the courier impossible the soviet had yelled it s taleniekov it certainly is and he chooses a man from the unter den linden to make contact a man whose face he knows i ll never forget the odds were that i d lose control and kill you in washington i m exposed vulnerable re wrong it s a white contact so was east berlin you son of a bitch what are you going to do earn some of my severance pay you re coming in no yes the man had lunged at scofield three days had passed since that moment of violence three mornings since scofield had deposited the package at the embassy and sent the cipher to sevastopol still no one had come to the door across the hall and that was not normal the suite was leased by a brokerage house in bern switzerland to be available for its executives standard procedure for international businessmen and also a transparent cover for a soviet drop bray had forced the issue the cipher and the courier s dead body had to provoke someone into checking the suite of rooms yet no one had it did not make sense unless part of taleniekov s cable was true he was acting alone one explanation the soviet killer had been terminated and before retiring to an isolated life somewhere in the vicinity of grasnov he had decided to settle an outstanding debt he had sworn to do so after prague the message had been clear you re mine beowulf agate someday somewhere i ii see you take your last breath a brother for a wife the husband for the brother it was vengeance rooted in loathing and that loathing never left there d be no peace for either of them until the end came for one it was better to know that now thought the bray rather than find out on a crowded street or a deserted stretch of beach with a knife in the side or a bullet in the head the courier s death was an accident taleniekov s would not be there would be no peace until they met and then death would come one way or the other it was a question now of drawing the russian was the stalker the role established the strategy was classic tracks clearly defined for the stalker to follow and at the chosen moment least expected thetracks would not be there the stalker bewildered exposed the trap sprung like bray taleniekov could travel anywhere he wished with or without official sanction over the years both had learned too many methods a plethora of false papers were out there for purchase hundreds of men everywhere ready to provide concealment or transportation cover or weapons any and all there were only two basic requirements identities and money neither he nor taleniekov lacked either both came with the profession the identities quite naturally the moneyless so more often than not the result of having been hung by bureaucratic delays in the forwarding of payments demanded every specialist worth his rank had his own personal sources of funds payments exaggerated monies diverted and deposited in stable territories the objective was neither theft nor wealth merely survival burned once or twice to learn the necessity of economic back ups bray had accounts under various names in paris munich london geneva and lisbon one avoided rome and the communist bloc the italian treasury was madness and banking in the eastern satellites too corrupt scofield rarely thought about the money that was his for the spending in the back of his mind he supposed he would give it back one day had the predatory congdon not flirted with his own temptations and made the official termination so complicated bray might have walked in the next morning and handed him the bankbooks not now the undersecretary s actions ruled it out one did not hand over several hundred thousand dollars to a man who tried to orchestrate one s elimination while remaining outside the act itself it was a very professional concept scofield
shouts exploding shells machine he can see the image of the teevee screen reflected like some strange low moon in the left bottom corner of the living room s picture window the battle raging across its ghostly surface captain carefully forks another waffle from the platter and butters it slowly the movements of his huge hands precise jimbo is fascinated as always by the strange grace the delicate touch of captain s powerful frightening hands jimbo thinks of captain s hobby his miniature armies of tiny toy soldiers with all the small features of the faces all the details of the uniforms so exact all the bright colors so cleanly painted so painstakingly perfect those huge hands jimbo thinks big dicks big dicks the candlelight glistens like liquid on the butter knife its motions and on captain s wide gold wedding band small moons of candle flame are gathered in the thick centers of captain s glasses and jimbo worries he always worries when lie ca nt see captain the liquid spreading thickly evenly to the waffle s edges stopping there a perfect puddle captain is srniling faintly he is smiling his tightly grim smile the most dangerous of all jimbo s stomach knots with fear he has a sudden urge to swirl from the table and run run for his life fie remembers suddenly that long ago day he failed at fishing tfiat fearful day he could not touch the silvery form flopping to death in the deep grass you have to snap its neck captain had told him so it wo nt suffer too much so it wo nt have to drown in the air could not could not meet the eyes the fish eyes captain s captain had had nothing but contempt for him had even hated him at that moment jimbo had more tli in suspected as he watched captain pick up the still twitching trout and walk grimly toward him it ca nt hurt you captain had said it s just i said do it goddamn girl jimbo swirled to run but captain caught him by the back of his shirt captain cupped the back of jimbo s head and neck in one of his huge hands and with the other slowly rubbed the t rout over jimbo s face until at last the fish hung limp and dripping jimbo is being held up like a fish his mouth feels torn a tliumb stuffs a gill fingers burn scales perhaps he is dreaming should he be frightened actually he is numb and more wes these things than feels them no he only sees them he does not feel them at all it is a dream it is the old fish dream a dream he has had often since that day he failed at fishing the pressure is gentle a gentle squeezing but this is not the dah dream it is his foot his right foot but is he asleep his right foot is being held is warm in a huge hand jimbo blinks his eyes in the darkness the dark form sitting on the bed beside him is framed in the hall light coming through the open door soldierboy the dark form whispers jimbo can smell whiskey the warm hand holding his foot is damp soldierboy you awake yes sir jimbo nods in the darkness you want to camp out tonight soldierboy the form whispers yes yes sir jimbo says and sits up jimbo rubs his eyes in the bright hall light as he follows the slightly weaving captain toward the kitchen camping out hot dog it had been a long time since captain had asked him to camp out maybe everything was all right now maybe it did nt matter that he had failed again failed today at the dreamland swimming pool failed this time at swimming maybe it was all right now captain had gotten him up right and captain had asked him to have to go to summer camp after all maybe swimming would not matter now uncle boomer is sitting at the kitchen table his face is very pale in the bright overhead light and there are deep shadows under his eyes and in the hollows of his cheeks he is wearing his old battered gray fedora tilted back on his head as always and as always a cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth with his fedora and his thin black mustache boomer looks to jimbo like that teevee detective boston blackie jimbo wishes he had a fedora and a thin black mustache jimbo wishes he was a teevee detective he will be someday all right someday anyway boomer sure does nt look like an undertaker which is what he is worm pies boomer always says that s my business worm pies hello squirt boomer says to jimbo in his deep froggy voice the source of his nickname jimbo grins at him uncle the kitchen table jimbo blinks then rubs his eyes jimbo stares at the snow piled tabletop no it s not snow jimbo realizes squinting his eyes no it s sugar he realizes spotting the opened sugar canister at the table s edge sugar two maybe three pounds of sugar white and sparkling in the bright light spread out over the tabletop shaped into little rolling hills with finger tracks traced like small roads through them damn captain says jimbo glances up at captain s looming weaving form at the end of the table i went to wake up my soldierboy and i clean forgot to relieve myself captain says you forgot to go potty boomer says and pours a water glass dearly full from a bottle in a paper bag yes yes i did i clean forgot to drain my hog captain says and walks unsteadily back toward the hallway boomer chuckles and takes a long drink from the water then puts his finger iii his mouth how does it taste squirt boomer asks and winks
the ceiling as he staggered backward it was a costly stagger before he could get off another round pedestrian was off the couch and the toe of his right shoe was connecting sharply with the underpart of zarubkin s nose the russian stood suddenly erect pistol still in hand shut his eyes then collapsed to the floor like an empty sack he did not stir knight knelt over him uncurled his fingers and tossed the tokarev onto the couch he s dead pedestrian said without emotion from across shit knight sat on the floor and hugged his knees a dark green mercury glided to a halt in front of a neatly manicured lawn its motor died but the driver did not get out he continued to sit with both hands on the wheel staring at the rearview mirror the street like any in the suburbs at this time of morning was deserted except for a squat mail truck making its rounds as the truck lumbered around a corner and disappeared from sight in the mirror he saw the familiar buick approaching from behind it pulled over just in back of him he stepped out of his car walked around it to the pavement and entered the buick the man in the hat sat in the driver s seat well he said zarubkin is dead except for little lines of pain that appeared briefly in the corners of his eyes the man in the hat remained impassive he did said how do you know one of our people was stationed in front of rainbow s apartment house he saw the body removed in the middle of the night could he be mistaken it was zarubkin rainbow and pedestrian were seen later there was perspiration in the creases of the speaker s palms he waited feeling a headache coming on did zarubkin talk we do nt know the man in the hat did not move he blinked several times then said very quietly i want to make something very clear and i will say it only once are you listening yes i do nt care how you do it he began in the same even voice then shouted as he smashed a fist down on the dashboard but get rid of rainbow and pedestrian get rid of them both the other man bumped his head on his it s coming in carl barnes said consulting a pocket size notebook we ll be ready to go by the twenty fifth at the outside matter of fact i d like each of you to take a few liters home next week the lab fridge is getting crowded he sat hunched over in a leather chair near the fireplace anticipating durst s pleasure a log crackled sending a morse code of sparks flying as it settled in the grate you re sure of the date absolutely frank it s simple arithmetic and a double shipment just arrived is that safe dr glover asked except for the anderson broad i m the biology department and she does nt seem to notice or care i think she s being serviced by some stud from tremont which is a lucky break for us miles trumbull guffawed louella anderson that cow s got herself a boyfriend than she is gawd trumbull chuckled i guess it s better than dipping it into a can of oil but not much he slapped the arm of his chair carl barnes and the doctor joined in the laughter all right durst said the anderson woman has a lover and presents no danger may we proceed he turned to dr glover who immediately grew sober have we identified all the families glover nodded four hundred and twelve of them all steady customers of miles very well let s shoot for the twenty fifth he raised inquiring eyebrows at trumbull everything set at the dairy trumbull nodded yep come d day carl and i will be handling the zeta at the bottling plant it s a go frank durst stared into space as if unreeling a familiar movie in his mind then stood up and reached four glasses of scotch dropping two ice cubes into one of them on the rocks if i remember correctly doctor glover winked and accepted the drink along with the others one reminder durst said except for miles and the doctor s necessary visits to the hospital no one leaves dalton understood he looked about saw no disagreement and broke into an uncharacteristic smile which soon faded he raised his glass as the rest shuffled to their feet gentlemen he said i give you operation crucible operation crucible they intoned the director pushed a pile of papers aside and from behind his surprisingly messy desk decorated with the memorabilia of three wars and six administrations assessed harcourt you look distraught bad news i m afraid waved to a chair he sat ramrod stiff across the desk from his superior hands in lap buttoned what is it the beshlenkov affair we ve failed not only that but beshlenkov is dead for the first time in the twenty six years they had worked together harcourt extracted a marked reaction from the director the granite face went ashen tell me about it do not omit a single detail twenty minutes later he looked across the desk is that all of it yes sir let me say now that rainbow is beyond argument our finest agent and pedestrian is not far behind considering his age i consider them faultless in the entire affair the director waved his hand as if chasing away a bothersome insect yes yes of course he thought a moment then murmured an experiment in an american city that s it then they have zeta and i have no doubt that it will be a success he leaned forward my god harcourt my god we re years behind them on this harcourt waited a respectable length of time before raising the

stomach until his eyes were covered there was no way to see dr battle except to sign a clipboard and wait her turn as a patient she had to wait two hours she liked him though he was too busy and groggy from overwork and thought she was in a fond dazed rush not listening

ask them here the weekend passed so slowly it did nt so much pass as chafe along it ground to a stop and started up again it rasped on morgan s nerves actually this was not entirely the merediths fault it was more the fault of brindle who faded into tears a dozen times a day or bonny who overdid kate who was arrested in ocean city on charges of possessing half an ounce of marijuana but morgan blamed the merediths anyhow he could nt help but feel that leon s sulkiness had cast some kind of evil spell and he was irritated by the way emily hung around bonny all the time who had befriended emily first after all who had first discovered her she had changed just wearing different shoes on her feet had somehow altered her he began to avoid her he devoted himself to gina a sad sprouty child at an awkward age just the age to tear at his heart he made her a kite from a hefty bag and she thanked him earnestly but when he looked into her face he saw that she was really watching her parents who were arguing in low voices at the other end of the porch he began reflecting on joshua bennett a new neighbor back in baltimore this bennett was an antique dealer like henry the eighth and he lived a gentlemanly life eating small expensive suppers then reading leatherbound history books while twirlinga snifter of brandy early last spring when bennett first moved in morgan had paid a call on him and found him in a maroon velvet smoking jacket with quilted satin lapels where would one go to buy a smoking jacket bennett had somehow received the impression that morgan had descended from an ancient baltimore shipping family and owned an atticful of antique bronzes and he had been most cordial offering morgan some of his brandy and an ivory tipped cigar morgan wondered if bennett would have accepted an invitation to the beach he began plotting his return to baltimore the friendship he would strike up the conversations they would have he could hardly wait to get back meanwhile the weekend dragged on kate had disgraced the family bonny said now she was on the police files marked for life bonny seemed to take this very seriously her because the cottage had no telephone the ocean city police had had to call the bethany police and have them notify the gowers naturally therefore the news would be everywhere now saturday at breakfast bonny laid a blazing hand on louisa s arm and asked kate how do you think your grandma feels her late husband s name which up till now has been unbesmirched morgan had never heard her use the word unbesmirched before and he was nt even sure that it existed he took some time thinking it over louisa meanwhile went on calmly spooning grapefruit what do you say mother bonny asked her louisa peered out of her sunken eyes and said well i do nt know what all the fuss is about we used to give little babies marijuana any old time it soothed their teething no no mother that was belladonna bonny said kate merely looked in a row and watched like members of a jury and on the beach where the ocean curled and flattened beneath a deep blue bowl of sky and gulls floated overhead as slow as sails this group was a motley scramble of blankets thermoses sandy towels an umbrella that bared half its spokes every time the wind flapped past a squawking radio and scattered leaves of newspaper kate who had been grounded for the rest of her vacation flipped angrily through seventeen bonny sweated and shivered in layers of protective garments the white zinc oxide on her nose and lower lip along with her huge black sunglasses gave her the look of some insect creature from a science fiction movie gina dug a hole in the sand and climbed into it billy and priscilla made a spectacle of themselves lying too close together on their blanket and emily in an unbecoming pale blue swimsuit that exposedher thin limp legs took pictures that were going to turn out poorly she worried that he would snap her she said morgan swore he would nt she was already pasted in his mind as he would like her to be forever wearing her liquid black skirt and ballet slippers he would surely not choose to record this other self she had become all i want to do he told her is photograph some groups some action do nt you see he could nt bear her finicky delays
ca nt patrick leaned toward him and his face was one jason had never seen before it was tight and knowing and not too kind laddie you know that not all of our guests are nice virtuous married folk you ve known that for years but we do nt blatantly advertise that illicit couples are particularlyinvited we do nt imply we re running a brothel if we have to shut our eyes to some things well as you once said mr mulligan that s business jason s voice had become bitter i m not a seminarian mr mulligan i do know something of the world i know we ca nt demand that every couple who comes to ipswich house show us a marriage certificate dammit but we do try to run a decent place and that spwhy we have a good guest list of respectable people mainly but literally to advertise you mean implying not advertising jason said daniel not even schofield would be so blatant jason gave him a scathing glance he is nt actually going to advertise what the place will be in the newspapers he ll just spread the word i accused him and he never denied it word of mouth is almost as good as advertising outright who knows said daniel and shrugged and looked at his uncle patrick said you re not as white as snow yourself jase you visited mrs lindon s establishment before you married my daughter now now let me finish i know that patricia s delicate always was i know it would kill her to have more children i do nt condemn you laddie not at all men are men and women are women but you re not one to sit in judgment either jason had become very pale i d rather see you in some nice clean place like mrs lindon s than killing my daughter making her have more children i know you love my colleen and you re sparing her it s glad i am you are jason you re a considerate husband not a bad one and how many men do you think are like you if you blame anyone i m thinking you should blame nature who did it all it s not of our choosing jason said and it s nature that makes us shit too but we do it privately not publicly with music patrick smiled it s not the same kind of pleasure jase jason s fists clenched again he was still pale have you given a thought mr mulligan to the young girls who will be involved in all this jase said patrick no one forces any girl into what is called a life of sin never mind the tales of white slavers that s very rare a girl chooses her life i doubt that schofield s hotel will be filled with streetwalkers and sluts and cheap whores men who go there will be rich enough to afford the best naughty ladies no doubt but beautiful and stylish ones like many who come to the inn tavern and ipswich house his eyes narrowed on jason pand they were not too friendly and jason felt something quite close to despair ladies such as uncle pat mentions usually retire on rich estates said daniel smiling they re do nt break your heart over them jason many are well paid actresses and chorus girls the florodorasextet did very richly for themselves i ve seen many of them in splendid cadillacs on fifth avenue they also live in little mansions with servants and travel abroad after their retirement some have famous shops exclusive restaurants or own jewelry stores some even married wealthy men i see i m getting nowhere said jason what i am interested in said patrick is has he any idea who owns my thousand acres jason felt very tired after all he had not slept all night i do nt think so he said in a dull voice but he ll find out and that s why i wanted to see you sir to ask you not to sell to him if he offers he wo nt find out said patrick he paused no jason saw a deep look being exchanged between uncle and nephew and felt sicker than ever think patrick mused to daniel a thousand dollars an acre he pulled a paper toward him and a pencil he figured then he whistled damn he said we could ask more he probably wants it badly enough said daniel we could pay off the mortgage on ipswich house and finish the new hotel and more jason said have you thought what will happen if he wo nt buy at your price mr mulligan we could nt build a respectable hotel next to his he ll buy said daniel i say at least fifteen hundred dollars an acre it s choice property i ll look into it at once jason stood up his eyes were sore with sleeplessness he turned slowly defeated he saw molly near been there unnoticed her eyes encountered his and her face was both compassionate and understanding he wanted to go to her and hold her the longing was like a terrible hunger in him it was a desire for a refuge in a strange and alien land a desire for love and companionship and surcease but as he went toward the door she moved aside though she did not look away from him he left the office the two men and molly watched him go then daniel said coldly i knew it was wrong of you uncle pat to put him on the deed he ll never agree there are ways said patrick and thought of his daughter who loved money even more than she did her children patricia was a sensible girl for a considerable time now patrick had been aware of patricia s shrewdness a trait he had not known earlier in her life he was quite

here s molly s picture on the mantel is nt she beautiful it s from her school play they say she has a talent for acting i ca nt imagine where she got it there s never been an actor in our family what do you think of her bonny do nt we still have jeannie s wedding album there was something feverish about him emily thought ile darted around the room rummaging through various overloaded shelves emily and bonny stood in the doorway watching him once they happened to glance at each other but when emily saw bonny s expression oddly hooded she looked away again please she told morgan i ought to be going i but you have nt met my mother he said stopping short and i wanted bonny to get to know you i wanted you two to bonny emily was in the paper today was she bonny said where s the paper did you throw it out i think it s in the kitchen come to the kitchen let s all go let s all have some coffee he said he raced away bonny straightened from the door frame to follow him and emily trailed behind she wished she could just vanish she thought of ducking out soundlessly slipping away before they noticed she dodged a mobile of homemade paper sailing ships and stepped into the kitchen the counters in the kitchen were stacked with dirty dishes and several animals feeding bowls cluttered the floor one wall was shingled with yellow cartoons and news clippings and hockey schedules recipes calendars dental appointment cards invitations even someone s high school diploma emily felt surrounded flooded over by the back door morgan was plowing through a stack of newspapers where is it where is it did it come he asked aha he held up a paper he laid it flat on the floor licked his thumb and started turning pages news editorials crafts revival in baltimore peering over his shoulder emily saw leon s sober face he seemed to be staring at her out of another world bonny here s leon emily s husband morgan said and here s her daughter gina see very nice said bonny setting out coffee cups you know morgan said thoughtfully i once looked a little like leon bonny glanced at the photo like that man there never she said well yes he said but there s something about the eyes maybe i do nt know or something around the mouth or maybe it s the forehead i do nt know he stood up abandoning the paper and pulled out a chair from the table sit down sit down he told emily he took a seat opposite as if demonstrating and fixed her with an urgent focused look till she sat too she felt trapped the dishes on the counters towered so far above her that she imagined they might teeter and topple swamping her a typewriter stood in a puddle of orange juice on the table with a sheet of paper in the carriage resolution was passed by a show of hands she read and matilda grayson requested that bonny placed a carton of cream in front of her and a crumpled sack of pantry pride sugar were you working on something yes bonny said she handed emily a cup of coffee and sat down next to her um what do you do for a living mrs gower i m morgan s wife for a living oh i see yes bonny said but do you see that it s a full time fob it keeps me busy every minute i tell you oh from outside he seems so comic and light hearted such a character so quaint but imagine dealing with him i mean the details of it the coping stuck at home while he s off somewhere wondering who he thinks he is now do you suppose we could nt all act like that go swooping around in a velvet cape with a red satin lining and a feathered hat that part s the easy part imagine being his wife finding a cleaner who does ostrich plumes keeping his dinner one of his cronies that i have never net salvation army burns or astrologists or whatever other awestruck smitten people he digs up emily set her cup down you think i do nt appreciate him you wonder why he married me bonny said no no said emily she looked across at morgan who seemed unperturbed he was tipping contentedly in his chair like a child who is confident he s the center of attention and puffing on a cigarette twisted ropes of smoke hung around his head emily bonny said emily turned to her emily morgan is the manager of a hardware store emily waited but that was the end of it bonny seemed to be expecting her to speak yes emily said after a minute cullen hardware bonny said she knows that bonny morgan said she does bonny stared do nt think he s a rabbi or a greek shipping magnate no emily said she decided not to mention how they d met bonny pressed her fingers to her lips there were freckles emily saw dusting the back of her hand after all she was a pleasant woman she gave a little laugh you must think i ve lost my mind she said crazy bonny right morgan s crazy wife bonny oh no it s just that i worried you might have been misled morgan s such a well prankster in a way yes i know about that you do bonny said she glanced over at morgan morgan smiled seraphically and blew out a whoosh of smoke but i think he s trying to give it up said emily oh i hope takes so much ingenuity to manage some of that foolishness think what he could accomplish if he used that brain for sensible things if he straightened out
the incredibly soiled feeling as one by one those men no she would not dwell on it she closed her eyes and breathed deeply failing to notice the letter slip out of her lap as she changed position the moment of strain passed the details of that harrowing night successfully pushed out of her mind she opened her eyes noticed the letter on the floor and quickly recovered it the letter was from papa s brother uncle matt the man who had first encouraged eleanor to try a professional stage career matt kent had served as a genial and expert guide when she and leo had honeymooned in paris among the theaters they d visited was the comediefrangaise where eleanor s toolong marie charboneau had performed for a few real news concerned tom the son uncle matt had never seen before the boy s birth matt s estranged wife dolly of whom he still wrote and spoke in the most affectionate terms had gone out to the north west frontier of india as a schoolteacher for officers children now matt said tom was hoping for a career as an officer in the indian army an organization not to be confused with the british army in india he pointed out down to the very last soldier of the line those in the british army in india were englishmen the indian army included many nativeborn noncommissioned officers and enlisted men india was a colorful if dangerous place to soldier uncle matt concluded he wanted to visit it and sketch its sights one day eleanor suspected that what he really wanted was to get his first look at young tom she folded the letter and put it in her reticule the train was rumbling past shanties and wooden tenements standing on turbulent across the river large brick homes perched on a steep hillside their fronts supported on pilings the train passed a factory complex eleanor recalled pemberton saying the town s main industry was steel but trivial things could nt keep her mind off leo for very long they had been married almost four and a half years in all that time despite mutual tenderness and consideration for the feelings of the other they had been unable to solve the problem which was eleanor s legacy from that dreadful night in her father had sensed the existence of the problem of course she could nt discuss it with him but the problem was so serious that discussions with leo were inevitable time and again she told him the difficulty did nt matter he agreed or pretended to agree then contradicted that attitude a day or so later by another desperate attempt to prove that the problem did nt exist he always failed she repeatedly told him the fault was hers thing that might have convinced him she could nt open the imaginary door and by sharing the secret with her husband destroy its power over her she simply could not do it and so leo s despondency and bitterness grew steadily worse now the train was rolling across a huge stone bridge at least fifty feet wide the bridge carried four sets of tracks looks like we re coming in pemberton said our hotel s the hulbert house it s supposed to be the newest in town before we left new york they wired that they were heavily booked but i think we managed to squeeze everyone in leo eleanor tapped his arm his eyes opened we re here she said leaning over to kiss his closely shaved cheek in a night off leo played marcus brutus snap an eccentric and flamboyant theatrical manager a role far removed from the somber silence with which he regarded her now luggage from overhead racks on either side of the train spread a panorama of tenements and business buildings made indistinct by the rain and the dark sky feeling a little more rested she asked leo shrugged i slept i do nt think i got much rest she held back a retort melancholy was becoming a way of life for him she hated that she knew he had many more reasons than one for becoming embittered yet that understanding did nt make it any easier to live with him he tugged the brim of his derby down over his forehead slouched on the seat and stared out the window what he saw quickly soured his expression god someone in pittsburgh told me they manufacture a lot of barbed wire here a fitting product for such a depressing place regis said it s an excellent theater town oh certainly in this weather i m sure we ll play to all of a dozen these days he was so unlike the merry confident and outgoing leo goldman she d first met at an amateur theatrical club in new york he was still handsome but the frustration caused by their failure to achieve a satisfying physical relationship seemed to be eroding his good looks as well as his good spirits one indicator of his unhappiness was the frequency with which he reminisced about the past although he d spent his boyhood in poverty on new york s lower east side he already regarded that boyhood with great nostalgia often after a performance he would lie on the bed in their hotel room lock his hands under his head and deliver a long rambling monologue about the days when there had been a mezuzah on the doorpost and pushcarts selling oilcloth garlic fish and a hundred other items in the street after a skimpy meal those carts could provide dessert if you were clever and fast apples went down your shirt front bananas newspapers from park row but there had been moments of relaxation too wonderful moments there were breathtaking vistas of the city to be seen from tenement rooftops bright immies to be won in a marble shoot a rubber ball to be solidly whacked in the hester street
made that point she was sure of it at five o clock she returned to the courtroom as she entered the jury sent word to the judge that it had reached a verdict five minutes later the foreman announced the verdict robert odendall not guilty on all counts jonathan odendall not guilty on all counts i do nt believe it katie was nt sure if she had spoken aloud the judge s face hardened into angry lines he dismissed the jury curtly and very lucky he snapped luckier than i hope you ll ever be again in either of your lives now clear out of my courtroom and if you re smart you ll never appear before me again katie stood up no matter if the judge clearly felt the verdict was erroneous she had lost the case she should have done more she felt rather than saw the victorious smile the defense attorney shot at her a thick hard lump burned in her throat making it impossible to swallow she was within inches of tears those two criminals were about to be released on the streets after flouting justice a dead boy had been labeled a criminal she stuffed her notes into her briefcase maybe if she had nt felt so lousy all week she d have conducted a better case maybe if she d had this hemorrhaging problem taken care of a year ago instead of delaying and putting it off with this crazy childish fear of hospitals she will the state please approach the bench she looked up the judge was beckoning to her she walked over to him the spectators were filing out she could hear delighted squeals as the odendalls embraced their gum chewing braless girlfriends your honor katie managed to keep her voice steady the judge leaned over and whispered to her do nt let it get you down katie you proved that case those little bastards will be back here in two months on other charges we both know it and next time you ll nail them katie tried to smile that s just what i m afraid of that they will be back god knows how much damage they ll be doing before we can nail them but thanks judge she left the courtroom and went back to her office maureen looked up hopefully katie shook her head and watched the expression change to sympathy she shrugged what can you her office mr myerson and dr carroll are in a meeting they do nt want to be disturbed but of course you can go in no i m sure it s the lewis case and i d be of no use to them or anyone else right now i ll catch up on monday all right katie i m sorry about the odendall verdict but try not to take it so hard you really look sick are you all right to drive you re not dizzy or anything no really and i m not going far i ll be driving just fifteen minutes and then i wo nt budge till sunday as she walked to the car katie shuddered the temperature had gotten up to about forty degrees in the afternoon but was dropping rapidly again the wet damp air penetrated the loose sleeves of her red wool wraparound coat and pierced her nylon hose she thought how great it would be to be able to go there now to just go to bed with a hot toddy and sleep the weekend away at the hospital the admitting office had her completed forms waiting the clerk was briskly bright my goodness mrs demaio you certainly rate dr highley has given you the bedroom of suite one on the third floor that s like going on a vacation you ll never dream you re in a hospital he said something about that katie murmured she was not about to confide her fear of hospitals to this woman you may be a bit lonesome up there there are just three suites on that floor and the other two are empty and dr highley is having the living room of your suite redecorated why i do nt know it was done less than a year ago but anyhow you wo nt need it you ll only be here till sunday if you the buzzer the second floor nursing station takes care of both the second and third floor patients they re all dr highley s patients anyhow now here s your wheelchair if you ll just get into it we ll whisk you upstairs katie stared in consternation you do nt mean i have to use a wheelchair now hospital regulations the admitting clerk said firmly john in a wheelchair going up for chemotherapy john s body shrinking as she watched him die john s voice weakening his wry tired humor as the wheelchair was brought to his bed swing low sweet chariot coming for to carry me home the antiseptic hospital smell katie sat down in the chair and closed her eyes there was no turning back the attendant a middle aged solidly plump volunteer pushed the chair down the corridor to the elevator you re lucky to have dr highley she informed katie his patients that buzzer for someone and you ll have a nurse at your beck and call in thirty seconds dr highley is strict the whole staff trembles when he s around but he s good they were at the elevator the attendant pushed the button this place is so different from most hospitals most places do nt want to see you until you re ready to deliver and then they shove you out when the baby is a couple of days old not dr highley i ve seen him put pregnant women to bed here for two months just as a precaution that s why he has suites so people can have a homelike atmosphere mrs aldrich is in
precisely safaris through ancestral memories teach me many things the patterns ahhh the patterns liberal bigots are the ones who trouble me most i distrust the extremes scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future scratch a liberal and find a closetaristocrat it s true liberal governments always develop into aristocracies the bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments right from the first the little people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies of course all bureaucracies follow this pattern but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner it s that patterns are repeated my oppressions by and large are no worse than any of the others and at least i teach a new lesson the stolen journals it was well into the darkness of audience day before leto could meet with the bene gesserit delegation moneo had prepared the reverend mothers for the delay repeating the god emperor s reassurances pre porting back to his emperor moneo had said they expect a rich reward we shall see leto had said we shall see now tell me what it was the duncan demanded of you as you entered he wished to know if you had ever before had someone flogged and you replied that there was no record of nor had i ever before witnessed such a punishment his response this is not atreides does he think i m insane he did not say that there was more to your encounter what else troubles our new duncan he has met the ixian ambassador lord he finds hwi noree attractive he inquired of that must be prevented moneo i trust you to raise barriers against any liaison between the duncan and hwi my lord commands indeed i do go now and prepare for our meeting with the women of the bene gesserit i will receive them at false sietch lord is there significance in this choice of a meeting place a whim on your way out tell the duncan he may take out a troop of guards and scour the city for trouble waiting for the bene gesserit delegation at false sietch leto reviewedthis exchange finding some amusement in it he could imagine the reactions through the festival city at the approach of a disturbed duncan idaho in command of a fish speaker troop like the quick silence of frogs when a predator comes now that he was in false sietch leto of irregular domes at the edge of one false sietch was almost a kilometer across it had been the first abode of the museum fremen and now was their school its corridors and chambers patrolled by alert fish speakers the reception hall where leto waited an oval about two hundred meters in its long dimension was illuminated by giant glow globes which floated in blue green isolation some thirty meters above the floor the light muted the dull browns and tans of the imitation stone from which the entire structure had been fashioned leto waited on a low ledge at one end of the chamber looking outward through a half circle window longer than his body the opening four stories above the ground framed a view which included a remnant of the ancient shield wall preserved for its cliffside caves where atreides troops had once been slaughtered by harkonnen attackers the frosty light of first moon silvered the cliff s outlines fires dotted the cliffside the flames exposed where no fremen would have dared betray his presence the fires winked museum fremen exercising their right to occupy the sacred precincts museum fremen leto thought they were such narrow thinkers with near horizons but why should i object they are what i made them leto heard the bene gesserit delegation then they chanted as they approached a heavy sound all a jostle with vowels moneo preceded them with a guard detail which took up position on leto s ledge moneo stood on the chamber floor just below leto s face glanced at leto turned to the open hall the women entered in a double file ten of them led by two reverend mothers in traditional black robes that is anteac on the left luyseyal on the right moneo said the names recalled for leto the earlier words about the reverend mothers brought in by moneo agitated and distrustful moneo did not like the witches they re both truthsayers moneo had said anteac is much older than luyseyal but the latter is reputed to be the anteac has a scar on her forehead whose origin we have been unable to discover luyseyal has red hair and appears remarkably young for one of her reputation as he watched the reverend mothers approach with their entourage leto felt the quick surge of his memories the women wore their hoods forward shrouding their faces the attendants and acolytes walked at a respectful distance behind it was all of a piece some patterns did not change these women might have been entering a real sietch with real fremen here to honor them their heads know what their bodies deny he thought leto s penetrating vision saw the subservient caution in their eyes but they strode up the long chamber like people confident of their religious power it pleased leto to think that the bene gesserit possessed only such powers as he permitted the reasons for this indulgence were clear to him of all the people in his empire reverend mothers were most like him limited to the memories of only their female ancestors still each of them did exist as somewhat of an integrated mob the reverend mothers came to a stop at the required ten paces from leto s ledge the entourage spread out on each side it amused leto to greet such delegations in the voice and persona of his grandmother jessica the bene gesserit had
son he shouted down the hall murrough mac brian prince of the dal cais murrough mac brian they thundered back to him amid cheers and blessings murrough drew a deep breath and yelled at his victory celebration brian had particularly requested the attendance of those men still living who were survivors with him of the outlaw days in thomond now they entered the hall one by one cleaned and freshly dressed but with the scars of their most recent battle still on them and brian gave to each a special token some treasure of exceeding value liberated from the norse city as they came and knelt before him the herald read their names and aed made a brief poem reciting aengus who had been their physician when they had no other leti of the long knife his face permanently scarred into a grin that brian found beautiful because he knew its price kian and brendan and illan finn the brothers loaghaire and reardon bent knee fergus the fist and conaing the beautiful chief but no nessa nor ardan there were two piles of treasure in their names the finest of all scrupulously set aside on a table apart from the others and their names and deeds were recited by aed that all might hear the torches burned late in the hall and the cheering and singing could be heard clearly in the chapel where mahon knelt you are a born killer and you will go on killing mahon accused not looking at his youngest brother brian had finally forced a confrontation by invading the king s private chamber and now they stood separated by more than space in a room brian scarcely recognized it had been gone from the cold walls the floors were bare of rushes even the wealth of lamps had been replaced by one feeble stub of a candle the chamber now held only a thin pallet and a chest and one black crucifix hung on the wall it was the cell of an ascetic what have you done with your things brian asked ignoring his brother s accusation i do nt understand he waved his hand at the stripped room no of course you do nt mahon answered all you understand is warfare brutality lust for power you do nt realize that material objects are of no consequence compared to the wealth of the spiritual life i ve been praying to our lord to enlighten you as he has me but so far my prayers are unanswered brian scowled you do nt need to pray for my soul brother mahon gave him a look of curiously commingled disgust i must you and i both have so many guilts to expiate you surely earned god s wrath for the evil you unleashed at limerick and i is that what this is all about you re trying to punish yourself for what happened at limerick i could never punish myself sufficiently for what happened at limerick i can only try and beg god s forgiveness i misunderstood the nature of war i let myself be seduced by the trappings and the excitement i let my vanity blind me to the horrors around me but i can see them all now and i must atone atone brian snorted what have you got to atone for ivar and his allies are nursing their wounds on some sandy island infested with black flies where the fergus joins the shannon irish families that have quarreled with one another for years are united now proud of being munstermen together singing your praises and speaking of the possibility foreigners by god that s an accomplishment to be proud of and yet you sit here beating your breast and crying mea culpa i tell you frankly brother i would nt want a conscience like yours there is no logic in it mahon looked at him bleakly and i no longer want a soul like yours barbarous and cruel you are the wolf who devours the lambs to fill his own belly marcan has convinced me that we must walk in the paths of peace accepting god s will and marcan brian exploded marcan is a priest with his own view of god s will and i do nt happen to think that view is right for our situation i m not even convinced that it is god s will that we be victims though marcan used to expend a lot of energy trying to convince me of it he could not persuade me and so he has gone to work on you his accomplishment the deep voice was bitingly sarcastic marcan has brought me peace brian he has shown me that there are other paths that i may follow god sent him to me when i needed him most god did nt send him marcan came here himself to beg your influence in having him named bishop of killaloe marcan may preach humility but he hungers for power within the church as much as any tribal king hungers to expand his holdings i will war no more brian no matter what you say for it brings me too much pain i sent your own brothers into battle ill prepared i think and knew the guilt of seeing them die for a kingship i did not really value even then i tried to do better by you and yet when i see what you have become i think i would rather have buried you somewhere in tipperary with lachtna and niall i will build a new you think that is the best way for you to serve god charlemagne built churches too but he had a sword in his hand and it was with that sword that he brought christianity to the franks i renounce the sword forever mahon cried sensitive to something in his tone brian studied the king s face intently at last he said it is not god s wrath that frightens you
mineral realm itself threatens mankind all of life and the world itself there s poetry in that is nt there man s great technical works looming over him have coated him with deadly metal we ca nt carry the weight the blood is sobbing in us our brains grow feebler this disaster also overtook the roman empire it was nt the barbarians it was nt the christians it was nt moral corruption his lead to prevent the souring of wine lead was the true source of the madness of the caesars leaded wine brought the empire to ruin bones from roman graves do show extreme concentrations of the metal said vlada i ve examined those in my own lab and that was only rome now it s the whole world and it is nt the grand inquisitor s universal anthill that we have to worry about after all but something worse more titanic universal stupefaction a saturnian wild gloomy murderousness the raging of irritated nerves and intelligence reduced by metal poison so that the main ideas of mankind die out including of course the idea of freedom corde breathed sharply still ridding himself of imaginary smoke inhalation he drew in the blue icicle making air of the small park with its fallen fence of iron stakes collapsed on weeds and bushes i wonder if beech thinks as romantically as that said him but who knows said corde and i m sure i m overdrawing it but if there are mysterious forces around only exaggeration can help us to see them we all sense that there are powers that make the world we see that when we look at it and other powers that unmake it and when people shed incomprehensible tears they feel that they re expressing this truth somehow one that may be otherwise inexpressible in our present condition but it s a rare sense and people are nt used to it and it ca nt get them anywhere tears may be intellectual but they can never be political they save no man from being shot no child from being thrown alive into the furnace my late father in law would weep when he lost a patient at the same time he belonged to the communist underground the doctor would weep i wonder if the communist ever did this is an interesting talk said vlada me straight why of course said corde i m asking whether certain impulses and feelings which play no part in the scientific work of a man like professor beech and lie ignored or undeveloped in his nature may not suddenly have come to life these resurrections can be gruesome you can sometimes watch them clumsy absurd heart stirrings after decades of atrophy sometimes it s the most heartless people who are inspired after forty years of reckoning and calculation and begin to accuse everybody else of being heartless but as i see beech he s innocent of that the news let s call it that reaches him in his lab as he puts the results of his research in order like this earth which i ve been studying for a lifetime is a being too it gave birth to us all but we are ungrateful greedy and evil and this is news to him to continue your argument his feelings are untrained or undeveloped better now even if he cried which is not his way it would nt be a good approach to politics you can see that i sympathize with him and how i wish that clear exquisite brains like his could resolve all our questions they do nt though it s endearing however that he looks like a hayseed an ichabod crane but that he s a man of feeling and even a visionary he wants to protect and to bless but then he begins to talk and what neo darwinian stuff he expounds the two billion year struggle by organisms in the biosphere i d rather eat a pound of dry starch with a demitasse spoon than read this truth should have some style that s where you might be of help what if i tried to speak for him it would depend upon how it was done it depends upon what he would expect there would be no saved from poisoning by lead or heroin or synthetic narcotics like the tees and blues the doubtful part of his proposition is that human wickedness is absolutely a public health problem and nothing but no tragic density no thickening of the substance of the soul only chemistry or physiology i ca nt bring myself to go with this medical point of view whether it applies to murderers or to geniuses at one end of the scale is spofford mitchell did he rape and murder a woman because he put flakes of lead paint in his mouth when he was an infant at the other end are beethoven and nietzsche great because they had syphilis the twentieth century faustus believed this so completely that for the sake of his art he would nt have his lesions treated and the spirochete gave him his awful masterpieces as a reward you d call that kind of medical interpretation itself sclerosis or lead vlada followed this where beech sees poison lead i hold of the material world may put us into a case as heavy as lead a sarcophagus which nobody will even have the art to paint becomingly the end of philosophy and of art will do to advanced thought what flakes of lead paint or leaded exhaust fumes do to infants which of these do you think will bring us to the end of everything so that s how you understand this real philosophy not the groveling stuff the universities mainly do otherwise i remember how i used to stare at mendeleev s chart in the science class there it all was fe cu na he that s what we were made of i
side and the baptist churches hell anybody that can do card tricks could take over for that god but the god that thought up the churches of the mormons pearson shook his head as if sorry he had to say it he must ve come down here from pluto well i imagine the mormons do a great deal of good in the world mickelsson said glancing toward the woods sure they do same as ants and bees he leaned forward and after a moment stood up i suppose they re all right he said somebody thinks he knows how to get through this world alive i take off my hat to m he held out the dowsing rod adjusting his grip preparing to march down the mountain i take it you re neither a mormon nor a baptist catholic or presbyterian he added pearson turned to stare at him i m a witch he said they did nt tell you that mickelsson stared for the hundredth time uncertain whether or not he was having his leg pulled i guess i heard there were one or two of those around he said carefully not giving pearson the satisfaction of a questioning look pearson nodded soberly staring down at the forked stick in his hands if he d been teasing the mood had now left him this country s seen it all he sighed and slightly shook his head i imagine it s something to do with the darkness the way the clouds are always there or if they happen to break for a half a day it s like a miracle he raised his head to look across the valley people joke about it having a spell on it this country specially fahrm people but it does have i always thought maybe gaht a whole lot of spells on it layer on layer of em clear back to the time of the ice age prehistoric animals when they were driven owt put a spell on it indians when the white people came along they put a spell on it then the pennsylvania dutch then the railroad people now the polish and italian dairy fahrmers course none of the spells do a thing that s the truth of it ile narrowed his eyes to slits mountains do nt care he said they re like a old lean cow they give you what they can and if it ai nt enough they let you die and they forget you maybe dream you once in a while that s my theory bring you back for a minute like the spragues down there there s more life in the place than you d think the old man s mood every night around dusk the deer come out great big herds of em they stand up there grazing almost to the first morning light yup pearson said lotta deer all right bear too though you ll never see em plenty of skunks too them you will see owt crawling around your woodpile lookin for bees and beetles coons possums thousand different species of birds rattlesnakes mickelsson said hob goblins pearson said they looked at each other as if reassessing at last pearson grinned and looked away it was dusk when pearson finally found strong water or claimed he had right beside the garden fence they marked the place with a stake and went into the kitchen to settle up the dog stood just outside the door looking abused and in brief consternation mickelsson wondered if by country manners he should invite the dog in immediately he did with the old man he felt foolish a problem of the different languages they spoke no doubt every word and gesture half foreign while he was writing the check pearson fingered the scraped place on the door i see you scratched off the hex sign he said yes mickelsson said you think it was a bad idea pearson shrugged it s yore howse now he hung his rough hands on the bib of his overalls and looked into the livingroom you got a buckled floor he said i do nt recall seeing that before i ve got to fix that if i can figure out how mickelsson said according to the doc there s a spring under the house pearson s mouth dropped slowly open and he pointed at the floor as if imagining it was he who was having his leg pulled you gaht a spring he said that s what i was told mickelsson said well i ll be damned pearson said he pointed toward the kitchen door and the darkness beyond you got a spring right there under the floor and i spent half the afternoon owt there wandering around in the weeds with a stick jesus mickelsson said dawn breaking pearson s eyes widened and then suddenly both of them were laughing the old man s normally gray face darkened and he laughed as if he could barely get his breath mickelsson leaned on the refrigerator shaking jehoshaphat the old man said clacking his false teeth mickelsson bent over ile brought out talk about city slickers lord i should charge yott triple pearson roared i told you i ve been away from the farm a long time mickelsson said long time is right he drew back now both of them pearson said if it was anybody else i d say you owed me a drink good idea mickelsson said and with one more whinny wiping his eyes went over to the cupboard for glasses they drank in the kitchen mickelsson unable to figure out whether or not it would be right to invite the old man into the livingroom craziest thing i ever heard of the old man said and they laughed again sometime into their second drink mickelsson asked by the way how s your wife etta ruth died pearson said happened three weeks ago wensdee mickelsson set down his glass i m sorry
and from our room i heard men and shouts and slamming doors and sometimes glass breaking i never saw this crowd though i was often woken by it by tramping feet and songs and screams in the morning everything was quiet the only person around was an old woman with a broom sweeping the mess into a pile and taking it away in a bucket the manager of this hotel was an italian named tosco he wore a silver bracelet and pinched our faces too hard he had once lived in new york he said it was like hell father said i know just what you mean tosco liked honduras anything you wanted here he said what s the president like father asked he is the same as mussolini tosco said this name darkened father s face and with the shadow of the word still on it he said and what was mussolini like tosco said tough strong no fooling he made a fist and shook it under father s chin like this then he d better keep out of my way father said father spent part of every day in town and while he was there mother gave us lessons on the beach under thundery skies it was like play she wrote with a stick on the damp sand setting us arithmetic problems to solve or words to spell she taught us the different kinds of cloud formation if we chanced upon a dead fish she poked it apart and named each piece there were flowers growing beneath the palms parts in the blossoms back in hatfield we had studied indoors to avoid the truant officer but i preferred these outdoor lessons studying whatever we happened to find on the beach she was not like father father lectured us but she never made speeches when he was around she gave him her full attention but when he was in town she was ours she answered all our questions even the silliest ones such as where does sand come from and how do fish breathe usually when we returned to the gardenia father was on the piazza with someone from town this is mr haddy he would say he s a real old coaster and the prune skinned man would rise and creakily greet us there was nothing juanita shumbo did nt know about rearing turkeys she was an old black woman with red eyes mr sanchez had splashed up and down the patuca he was tiny and brown and had a father said and he made that man sneeze a zambu salutation there were many others and each of them listened closely to father they were respectful and seemed sitting nervously on their chair seats out of the sun to regard him with admiration he s wonderful with strangers mother said but the strangers made me uneasy for i had no clear idea of father s plans or how these people fitted in i wished i had father s courage lacking it i clung to him and mother for everything i had known that was comfortable had been taken away from me the other kids were too young to realize how far we had drifted from home except for the unicorn still at the pier the past had been wiped away coming back from the beach one afternoon we saw tosco at the hotel talking to his chevrolet he asked it questions and called it improper names he stood near its radiator grill and shouted and cuffed she stupid he said wagging his foot in pain she no want to go she hate me my husband will fix it and that evening with one of his new friends it was mr haddy father did fix it he said machines had bodies but no brains mr haddy stared as if father had said something wise tosco was so grateful for the repair work he said we could use the car anytime we liked the next day mother said she wanted to take us for a drive while father was occupied in town were we going to tela tosco asked no mother said we were going east toward trujillo tosco laughed he said you will come back soon and gave mother the keys which road do i take he said there is only one we drove through town and at once i could see that it was both chicken huts like the shacks on the beach but also large houses and green lawns the best of them were surrounded by fences that was the strangest thing to me because the connecticut valley was a land without fences except for horses and cows it reminded me of what captain smalls had said about honduras being like a zoo only the animals were outside and the people inside the cages but so far we were outside from this town road we came to the flat main road and turned left we went less than half a mile before the road became rutted and filled with broken rocks ahead was a bridge across a river it was a railway bridge but there was no other cars took turns using it mother waited and then drove along the planks and railway tracks of this girder bridge below us women were washing clothes in the cocoa colored river beyond the bridge the road gave out entirely it was a wide mud puddle that and finally not a road at all but a dry creek bed in which the rocks were higher than our front bumper this is the end of the line mother said we were a mile from the gardenia we tried other roads one ended at the beach another at a riverbank the same riverbank as before and a third became a quarry which was part of a mountain at the end of two of those roads skinny barking dogs jumped at our windows it was a town of dead ends i m not
they lashed it together with spare reepschnur cord and pushed it from the rocks into the water never to see it again for it went down like heavy chain then they started to swim the sun was setting but they had decided to get wet anyway and build a big fire on the other side since there was plenty of montana balsam all around jesse said it would nt burn which assured hardesty of a comfortable blaze by which to warm himself wrapping their clothes in bundles to put on across the water knapsacks balanced on their shoulders in theory only the bottom of the packs would get wet but that theory lasted only for the ten minutes that they could swim fast then at the center of the lake they sank deeper into the water and everything got drenched the water there was as cold as a mountain stream at midnight on the last day of january the colder they got the faster jesse talked in what sounded like a high speed collision between a physics textbook and a politician i know this may sound like an excuse he said but tensor functions in higher differential topology as exemplified by application of the gauss bonnet theorem to todd polynomials indicate that cohometric axial rotation in nonadiabatic thermal upwelling can by random inference derived from translational equilibrium aggregates array in obverse transitional order the thermodynamic characteristics of a transactional plasma undergoing negative entropy conversions why do nt you just shut up said hardesty jesse did nt open clothes near their fire collapsed and his purple knickers burned up from that time forward he went bare below the waist except for a new guinea style penis shield that he fashioned from a discarded dr pepper can and hung from his waist on a piece of reepschnur he soon took to extolling this form of dress as if he were a seventh avenue designer introducing a new line it s very comfortable he said you should try it two hours after the fire burned out a thundering mass of steel wheels and coughing diesels swung by the lakeshore and jesse and hardesty found a comfortable flatcar to carry them toward yellowstone hardesty got up first and jesse ran by the side of the tracks flagging dangerously until hardesty hoisted him aboard hardesty was easily able to see him because his buttocks shone in the light of the moon twenty four hours later they jumped off the train rather than ride north into montana and canada walked for a was the yellowstone river hardesty looked up at the sky which seemed to be threatening rain why do nt we build a shelter and see what we can do about crossing this river tomorrow he said i think it s going to rain rain you think that looks like rain jesse asked obviously you never were in the mountains for very long i know that it ca nt rain do you know what infallibility is i ll tell you it s me predicting the weather he glanced at the huge cumulonimbus clouds rolling toward them from the north in a mountain like wall that shredded up the moonlight that s going to pass in five minutes tonight will be pure velvet stretch out on the pine needles and sleep i do nt know hardesty said wary of the clouds trust me half an hour after they had fallen asleep a crack of thunder lying and turned them over like flapjacks lightning struck in machine gun reports felling trees the river which had already been a whipping dashing flume was now so fast and white that it looked like a streak of lightning itself and the rain that came down was not ordinary rain that falls in inoffensive drops hardesty and jesse tried as best they could not to drown follow me jesse said through a mouthful of water what for i know where there s shelter i saw it on the way in they swam uphill for a few hundred yards until they got to the entrance of a cave i do nt want to go in there hardesty proclaimed although he knew he would go in why not it s perfectly safe i ve always hated caves i guess it s because i m italian come on i ve been in this cave before i think if and he left a couple of nice feather beds supplies furniture and lamps sure hardesty said as darkness swallowed them up why do we have to go in so far to get to the hermit s place what about bats there are nt any bats west of the platte that s not true i ve seen bats in san francisco or east of fresno after twenty minutes of groping along dark paths in a hissing subworld of hidden streams and mocking echoes they came to what they sensed was a great chamber for the sounds of their footsteps fled away from them as if into the open air they felt vast space above and to the sides and no matter which way they walked they found no walls but only level floor of rock and earth they crossed small well behaved streams as warm as bathwater and saw in them glowing chains of phosphorescent creatures how own light blinking by the hundreds of thousands in busy silent codes they seemed like an army of dedicated workers absorbed in preparations for an unspecified journey batteries of little lights that racked up billions upon billions of permutations and combinations seemed to be driving unhindered toward some mysterious goal for hours or perhaps days hardesty and his guide wandered on the plain of lighted streams jesse completely forgot about the hermit s place all they cared for was the color the endless map of calculating rivulets and the routes of tranquillity and silence that they followed into pitch black emptiness like musical tones the streams mixed and separated hardesty
and you did nt see him when you regained consciousness after the events at the bridge no i did nt you do nt know where he went no sir neither does rome added the undersecretary quietly pointedly i learned that an italian soldier was hit by a truck and was pretty badly mangled screaming his head off someone said he had blond hair so i figured it was ricci and a man came out of the woods someone with a gash in his head put the soldier in a car and drove him away how did you learn this i asked questions a lot of questions after i got first aid that was my job sir it was a madhouse up there italians and french yelling all over the place but i did nt leave until i found out everything you re to be commended said the ambassador thank you sir let s assume you re right bradford leaned forward the blond man was ricci and someone with a head wound got him out of there have you any idea who that someone might be i think so one of the men he brought with him the other was killed so ricci and this other man got away but rome has nt heard from ricci would you say that s normal no way sir it s not normal at all whenever any of those people are damaged they bleed us for everything they can get and they do nt waste time about it our policy in black operations is clear if we ca nt evacuate the wounded i think we understand interrupted halyard an old soldier s antennae picking up a signal couched in a soldier s vocabulary and this demolitions expert got away intact they d have reached our embassy in rome as quickly as they could yes sir with their hands out and shouting all the way they would have expected attention pronto and threatened us with the kind we do nt want if they did nt get it what do you think happened i d say it s pretty obvious they did nt make it what was that asked brooks there is nt any other explanation i know those people sir they re garbage they d kill their mothers if the price was right they would have been in touch with rome believe me did nt make it repeated halyard staring at the man from col des moulinets what do you mean the roads sir they wind up and down those mountains like corkscrews sometimes without lights for miles at a time up and screaming that vehicle s a candidate for a long fall up there head wounds can be deceptive halyard commented a bloody nose looks a hell of a lot worse than it is it strikes me said brooks that same man acted with considerable presence of mind amid the chaos he functioned forgive me mr ambassador interrupted bradford his voice rising slightly but deferentially the intrusion was not a breach of manners but a signal i think the field officer s point is well taken a thorough search of those roads will undoubtedly reveal a car somewhere at the bottom of a precipice brooks exchanged looks with the man from state the signal was acknowledged yes of course realistically there is no other explanation just one or two more points and we re finished said bradford rearranging his papers as you know whatever is said here recording devices the words spoken here are stored only in our memories this is for the protection of all of us not just you so feel perfectly free to speak candidly do nt try to soften the truth we re in the same boat i understand sir your orders with regard to havelock were unequivocal he was officially classified beyond salvage and the word from rome was to terminate with extreme prejudice is that correct yes sir in other words he was to be executed killed at col des moulinets that s what it meant and you received those instructions from the senior attache consular operations rome a man named warren harry warren yes sir i was in constant touch with him waiting for the determination waiting for washington to give it to him how could you be certain the man you perplexed as if the question were foolish though the man who asked it was not foolish at all among other things i worked with harry for over two years i knew his voice just his voice and the number in rome it was a direct line to the embassy s radio room unlisted and very classified i knew that too did it occur to you that when he gave you your final instructions he might have been doing so under duress against his will no sir not at all it never crossed your mind if that had been the case he would have told me with a gun at his head said halyard how the code had been established and he used it he would nt have if there d been anything wrong explain that please said brooks what code that originate in washington they re referred to when decisions are transmitted that way you know the authorization s there without naming names if anything had been wrong harry would nt have used the code and i would have known something was nt right i d have asked for it and he would have given me a different one he did nt and i did nt he used the correct one up front what was the code for col des moulinets asked emory bradford ambiguity sir it came direct from cons op washington and will be listed in the embassy telephone logs classified files which is proof of authorization said bradford making a statement yes sir dates times and origins of clearance are in those logs bradford held up an eight by ten inch photograph of
suit before it had been impaled but where was harker gone another one just gone pascalli and fodor were out on the loading platform looking up and down the alleyway all that screaming jenny said stepping up beside bryce yet there s no blood on the floor or on the suit tal whitman scooped up several expended shell casings that had been spat out by the submachine gun scores of them littered the floor the brass casings gleamed in his open nt see many slugs looks like the sergeant hit what he was shooting at must ve scored at least a hundred hits maybe two hundred how many rounds are in one of those big magazines general copperfield stared at the shiny casings but did nt answer pascalli and fodor came back in from the loading platform and pascalli said there s no sign of him out there sir you want us to search farther along the alley before copperfield could respond bryce said general you ve got to write off sergeant harker painful as that might be he s dead do nt hold out any hope for him death is what this is all about death not hostage taking not terrorism not nerve gas there s nothing halfway about this we re playing for all the marbles i do nt know exactly what the hell s out there or where it came from but i do know that it s we ca nt even imagine yet driven by some purpose we might never understand the moth that killed stu wargle that was nt even the true appearance of this thing i feel it the moth was like the reanimation of wargle s body when he went after lisa in the restroom it was a bit of misdirection sleight of hand a phantom tal said using the word that copperfield had introduced with somewhat different meaning a phantom yes bryce said we have nt yet encountered the real enemy it s something that just plain likes to kill it can kill quickly and silently the way it took jake johnson but it killed harker more slowly hurting him real bad making him scream because it wanted us to hear those screams harker s murder was sort of like what you said about t it was a demoralizer this thing did nt carry sergeant harker away it got him general it got him for a corpse copperfield was silent for a moment then he said but the voice we heard it was your man jake johnson no bryce said i do nt think it really was jake it sounded like him but now i m beginning to suspect we re up against something that s a terrific mimic mimic copperfield said jenny looked at bryce those animal sounds on the telephone yeah the cats dogs birds rattlesnakes the crying child it was almost like a performance as if it were bragging hey look what i can do look how clever i am jake johnson s voice was just one more impersonation in its repertoire what are you proposing copperfield asked something super natural no this is real then what put a name to it copperfield demanded maybe it s a natural mutation or even something that came out of a genetic engineering lab somewhere you know anything about that general maybe the army s got an entire goddamned division of geneticists creating biological fighting machines manmade monsters designed to slaughter and terrorize creatures stitched together from the dna of half a dozen animals take some of the genetic structure of the tarantula and combine it with some of the genetic structure of the crocodile the cobra the wasp maybe even the grizzly bear and then insert the genes for human intelligence just for the hell of it put it all in a test tube incubate it nurture it what would you get what would it look like do i sound like a raving lunatic for even proposing such a thing frankenstein with a modem twist have they actually gone that far with recombinant dna research maybe i should nt even have ruled out the supernatural what i m trying to say general is that it could be name to it let your imagination run wild general no matter what hideous thing you conjure up we ca nt rule it out we re dealing with the unknown and the unknown encompasses all our nightmares copperfield stared at him then looked up at sergeant harker s suit and helmet which hung from the meat hook he turned to pascalli and fodor we wo nt search the alley the sheriff is probably right sergeant harker is lost and there s nothing we can do for him for the fourth time since copperfield had arrived in town bryce said do you still think it looks as if we re dealing with just a simple incident of cbw chemical or biological agents might be involved copperfield said as you observed we ca nt rule out anything but it s not a simple case you re right about that sheriff i m sorry for suggesting you were only hallucinating and theories jenny asked well copperfield said i want to start the first autopsy and pathology tests right away maybe we wo nt find a disease or a nerve gas but we still might find something that ll give us a clue you d better do that sir tal said because i have a hunch that time is running out corporal billy velazquez one of general copperfield s support troops climbed down through the manhole into the storm drain although he had nt exerted himself he was breathing hard because he was scared what had happened to sergeant harker the others had come back looking stunned old man copperfield said harker was dead he said they were nt quite sure what had killed sarge but they intended to find out man that was bullshit they must know what
the price it is not always like that said menenhetet indeed the night was unusual ptah nem hotep said perhaps our good menenhetet also takes pleasure from the recollection one must said menenhetet he shrugged in the morning i kissed that poor thief again and sent him limping back to megiddo and worked the horses toward tyre i was over the worst of the mountains and it was a quick trip down too quick coming out of one of the ravines we were going fast around a turn hit a rock and spilled i went leaping off the road but landed on my feet with heel the horses were screaming in their traces and the shaft that goes from their harness to the cart had split at the fastening in my pouch i had two hardwood spikes and leather thongs but still lost half the day let me say i was no carpenter by the time mu and ta were harnessed again the sun was overhead what a ride was ahead of me the road became no smoother and the chariot groaned through every one of its fastenings i did not know if i could get it all the way to tyre and hardly knew why i wanted to at this point it would be faster to travel m one horse with my weapons on the other but then no charioteer wants to lose his cart mine of course had little to distinguish it just a wood wagon still it had the lines of a chariot so my sense of what was proper did not suffer while only a few specks of paint still stuck those thongs around the shaft as though it was waiting to fall apart again i liked it enough to laugh for my own post was sore at its root better you than me old soldier i said to the chariot and we went on the road dipped it climbed it turned but the forest began to open into fields and around a knoll i could look down through the ravines to the sea there was air in my lungs of a sort i had never breathed before not even on the delta a smell it had to be of the very green itself and wholly composed of fish with an odor refreshing to my nose not like the fish that rotted on the mud flats of the nile no this good smell that came up into the hills from the loveliness of the very green was amazing to me as clean as if i were breathing the very scent of nut when she holds up the that gets into the sweat of men and some women i began to cry because i had never known a lady like that i do not mean that i wept like a child nor in weakness but with a healthy longing now that my pride because of what i had done to the thief felt much restored besides the water went out to a great distance extending beyond the strength of my eyes until i could not find the place where the sky overhead came down to meet the sea and that was part of why i wept as if a sight of the greatest beauty was being withheld from me then there were the ships i was used to our own sailboats on the river and the royal barks with their huge red and purple sailcloth and their gold and silver hulls that gave more show of our great wealth than watching a royal procession but these boats here on the very green so far away i could not even see the color of their a sight i had never known before they rode through long curves of water that almost buried them and their sails spread out like the wings of white butterflies i could not believe how many i saw and some by their direction were rowing away from tyre and some were sailing to it although as i descended i could not see tyre itself only the stones by the shore now riding by the rocky coast the road would sometimes climb over a spur of mountain that moved right into the sea like an arm in front of your nose and sometimes our wheels would wobble along a trail that almost came down to the rocks of the sea and these low roads were wet i had never before seen such streams of water to come at you the sea was like a serpent rolling down a hill if a serpent were to do such then smashing on the rocks i was covered with spray from the very green and what a taste it devils that live in shells and something mysterious as well maybe it was the smell of everything i did not know all i can say is that the feel of the very green as it sprayed on me still had much to do with a lady for it was also light and contemptuous and playful but could leave you chilled then it grew dark and i realized there were many gods and goddesses in this sea and their feelings could shift certainly the serpents that rose from the water now smashed with more force on the shore and left a noise like thunder the spray began to sting my eyes i was happy to climb a hill that lifted me above such spite but realized even as i got out of the chariot to lift the wheels from one smooth bump to the next that here the hill was of solid rock and workmen back so long ago as thutmose the third or was it nearer to the beginning with khufu must have labored for years it was truly a stairway and would have impressed me more if not for our egyptian works that are so much greater still i learned another truth about the sea for in the dark
hot little room with two fans one of which does nt work and george westrum manages to find the only place where the working fan stirs any air courage she told him it s only half past seven except where is everyone two doors opened simultaneously george westrum emerged from his and iris from hers they smiled greeted each other and walked together toward them jenny came next followed by joe forbes and then peter hurried out looking surprisingly fresh and bright eyed they sat or sprawled under the grapes their conversation desultory and idle as they waited for mr li he joined them looking both serious and somewhat anxious so that their greetings did not extract from him his usual beaming smile what s up for today asked forbes mr li nodded we spend morning we visit the thousand buddha caves also an ancient tomb and following lunch we look forward to jiaohe ancient city and then return to urumchi he hesitated and then turned to look at peter you were not in your room last night mr fox mrs pollifax s heart skipped a beat oh dear she thought in dismay i beg your pardon peter said coldly you were not in your room all night mr li repeated firmly and how the hell would you know that asked peter rallying while the others listened in astonishment because i looked in there are no keys as you know i looked in and went back many times to look you were not in your room all night mrs pollifax thought i ve got to stop this i ve got to think of something i do nt know what business it is of yours peter told china travel bureau he said formally i am responsible you were not in your room you were not anywhere in this compound i have to ask where did you go they had all frozen into a tableau staring mesmerized at mrs pollifax on ire china stationpeter who stared back at mr li they had been made uncomfortable by some unknown quality in mr li s voice and by the rising suspense of a long silence that iris broke at last by speaking actually said iris in a calm voice peter spent the night with me in my room all night every head swiveled toward iris and george westrum gasped mrs pollifax looked quickly at iris and then her glance moved to george who was staring incredulously at iris his mouth open she saw that his face had turned white as if he d been struck how strange this is thought mrs pollifax all of us simply sitting here and watching s quite true she said with a lift of her jaw he was with me george leaned forward his eyes cold with anger and disgust you slut he said biting the words through his teeth and he rose to his feet and stalked out of the arbor his back rigid his words seemed to reverberate or was it the hate behind them wondered mrs pollifax oh those tight thin lips she thought this had been there all the time even mr li looked stricken in an embarrassed voice he said to peter if that is i did nt malcolm said pleasantly surely it s time for breakfast now do nt you think he stood and walked across the arbor to stand casually behind iris chair and mrs pollifax loved him for this iris herself sat very still a flush on either cheekbone her head high yes indeed said joe forbes as his feet lis looked around her face without expression her glance resting lightly on mrs pollifax and then she too stood up jenny staring at her said well of all the mrs pollifax heard herself say firmly i think we ve had enough jenny gave her a hostile glare and turned to joe forbes poor george she said dramatically mrs pollifax on ire china station poor jenny he said lightly it was the first evidence that he d given of being aware of the shifting alliances they moved across the compound in procession malcolm walking silently beside iris joe forbes and jenny with mr li peter falling in at the rear with mrs pollifax said in a low voice i m in shock accept accept she murmured but why did she do it i do nt know she told him s becoming terribly important that we talk in private soon i think there could be more shocks ahead where s sheng ti now on his way by bus to urumchi i hope i suppose you mean you re worried about what sheng told us that we were followed last night into the desert yes he said with a frown you realize we have only sheng s word for that do nt you you and i have nt seen anyone we have no proof he could have made it up to hide the fact that he followed us himself possibly she conceded but in any case he added his face lightening tomorrow s the day for visiting the kazakhs up in the grasslands and at some point during the day i expect to vanish which will take care of anybody s lurking curiosity with this confident statement he held the screen door open for her to enter the dining spot in front of the one working fan he did not join them at all for breakfast mrs pollifax with dampened towel wrapped around her head forced herself to concentrate on sight seeing for the next hours there was nothing else to do she decided she was experiencing a sense of events moving inexorably now toward their conclusion and without any way to alter or color them that word inexorable again she thought with a shiver x was hiding in his cave at the edge of the tian shan mountains while sheng ti was somehow making his way to urumchi armed with his coveted ill
but they seemed far far away the lonesome gods then walking on i found the tracks again following them i fell down and when i got up from the sand my hands were bloody from the gravel there were other older tracks i was on some kind of a trail and it seemed to dip down into the hotter desert but beyond were the mountains my tongue was dry and i could not swallow my eyes hurt and i was very hot i wanted to lie down but the sand was like a hot stove for a time there was a sound a drumming sound and then it became the sound of horses and i turned around a half dozen riders were coming at me was it a dream my eyes blinked slowly and i frowned trying to make them out they were only a blur against the shimmering enormously long but that was the heat waves again they came up coming out of the heat waves and the dust and the foremost rider had a wooden leg they pulled up and the man with the peg leg said holy jesus it s verne s boy he dropped from the saddle amazingly agile and held his water bag to my lips a sip and a swallow then he took it away just rinse your mouth this time he said let it soak in a mite after a moment he said where you comin from boy where s your pa they killed him i said they were waiting for him he tried to push me away so i would not be hurt and they shot him he git any of them another man asked one i think peg leg gave me another swallow and then stepped me come on son he said we ll take you in then he hesitated your pa s dead boy what ll you do now i want to go to our house peter burkin will come reckon he will at that pete s a loyal man peg leg started off leading the way you got grub in that house boy you got some at to eat yes louis l amour we rode on for a little way and then he stopped and let me have a drink stopping me before i drank too much we come on your trail boy peg leg told me we follered you you come quite a stretch you surely did he looked down at me you got anybody in los angeles boy no sir then i said maybe miss nesselrode he there s quite a woman he turned in his saddle to speak to the others said if i stole any of her horses she d hang me he chuckled by damn i think she d do it too that there was some kinda woman boy when the time comes you find yourself a woman like that ai nt none any better a long time later after the drum of hooves and my own tiredness had made me fall asleep we rode up the lane toward our house all was dark and still tom peg leg said take a look inside see if there s anybody there we ll cover you tom swung down and gun in hand walked over to the door and lifted the latch he stepped inside a moment and we could hear him fumbling about for the candles then light streamed out the door his boots went from room to room s clean as a whistle peg peg leg lowered me to the ground you ll be all right here boy you an them injuns get along yes sir i know they set store by your pa you get some sleep now boy drink a mite now an again but do nt tank up until tomorrow then you ll drink more n you ever thought a man could hold an boy you be careful of that of spanish man he hears you re alive he ll come back for you he ll skin you alive for a moment longer he stayed and then he said you see boy i das nt stick around i m a man with enemies there s some as would hang me in a minute if they come upon me i d clare boy i m goin to pack it in an head north this here s can the lonesome gods make a good livin up there in frisco sellin maps to that gold mine folks think i lost he turned see you boy i m right sorry about your pa he was a good man for a long time i stood alone in the yard near where my father had fallen listening to the receding sound of their horses then i went inside and looked around i was alone in the house of tahquitz would he be angry that i was here would he come to drive me away or kill me what was tahquitz who was he or it i was very hungry yet i did not want to eat i straightened my bed undressed slowly then crawled into bed for what seemed a long time i lay still staring into the darkness above me somewhere far off there was a low rumble and the earth seemed to shake a little was it tahquitz was was the only home i had what would i do now what could i do would peter ever come again and why should i matter to him i was not his boy he had business of his own to see to a low wind moaned around the eaves and sand rattled against the windows and ran nervous fingers along the roof miss nesselrode had said i could come to her but if i did i should be close to my enemies and they would know i was alive and that they must not know to los angeles was a ride of five or six maybe seven
keeping a nice tight formation jackson thought but anybody can drive a bus spade let s go to burners on my mark three two one mark both pilots advanced their engine controls and engaged their afterburners new f engines the fighters lept forward with a sudden double thrust and went quickly through mach the kingfisher flight kingfisher warning warning the amerikantsi have increased speed kiev cautioned kingfisher turned in his seat he saw the tomcats a mile aft twin dart like shapes racing before trails of black smoke sunlight glinted off one canopy and it almost looked like the flashes of a they re attacking what the flight leader checked his mirror again negative negative hold formation the tomcats screeched fifty feet overhead the sonic booms they trailed sounding just like explosions shavrov acted entirely on his combat trained instincts he jerked back on his stick and triggered his four missiles at the departing american fighters three what did you do the russian flight leader demanded they were attacking us did nt you hear shavrov protested the tomcats oh shit spade flight you have four atolls after said two break right jackson ordered chris activate countermeasures jackson threw his fighter into a violent evasive turn to the left sanchez broke the other way in the seat behind jackson s the radar intercept officer flipped switches to activate the aircraft s defense systems as the tomcat twisted in midair a series of flares and balloons was ejected from the tail section each an infrared or radar lure for the pursuing missiles all four were targeted on jackson s fighter spade is clear spade is clear spade you still have four birds in pursuit the voice from the hawkeye said roger jackson was surprised at how calmly he took it the tomcat was doing over eight hundred miles per hour and accelerating he wondered how much range the atoll had his rearward looking radar warning light flicked on two get after them jackson ordered roger lead sanchez swept into a dove at the retreating soviet fighters when jackson turned two of the missiles lost lock and kept going straight into open air a third decoyed into hitting a flare exploded harmlessly the fourth kept its infrared seeker head on spade s glowing tail pipes and bored right in the missile struck spade at the base of its starboard rudder fin the impact tossed the fighter completely out of control most of the explosive force was spent as the missile blasted through the boron surface into open air the fin was blown completely off along with the right side stabilizer the left fin was badly holed by fragments which smashed through the back of the fighter s canopy hitting christiansen s helmet the right engine s fire warning lights came on at once jackson heard the oomph over his intercom he killed every engine switch on the right side and activated the in frame fire extinguisher next he chopped power to his port engine still on afterburner by this time the tomcat was to low speed configuration this gave jackson aileron control and he worked quickly to get back to normal attitude his altitude was four thousand feet there was nt much time okay baby he coaxed a quick burst of power gave him back aerodynamic control and the former test pilot snapped his fighter over too hard it went through two complete rolls before he could catch it in level flight gotcha you with me chris nothing there was no way he could look around and there were still four hostile fighters behind him spade this is lead roger lead sanchez had the four forgers bore sighted they had just fired at his commander hummer on hummer the controller was thinking fast the forgers were holding formation and there was a lot of russian chatter on the radio circuit spade this is hummer break off i say again break off spade spade is at your nine o clock two thousand feet below you the officer swore and looked at one of the enlisted men he worked with that was too fast sir just too fuckin fast we got tapes of the russkies i ca nt understand it but it sounds like kiev is right pissed they re not the only ones the controller said wondering if he had done the right thing calling spade off it sure as hell did nt feel that way the tomcats sanchez head jerked in surprise roger breaking off his thumb came off the switch goddammit he pulled his stick back throwing the tomcat into a savage loop where are you lead sanchez brought his fighter under jackson s and did a slow circle to survey the visible damage fire s out skipper right side rudder and stabilizer are gone left side fin shit i ought a hold together wait a minute chris is slumped over skipper can you talk to him negative i ve tried let s go back home nothing would have pleased sanchez more than to blast the forgers right out of the sky and with his four missiles he could have done this easily but like most pilots he was highly disciplined roger lead spade this is hummer advise your condition over hummer we ll make it unless something else falls off tell them to have docs standing by chris is hurt i do nt know how bad it took an hour to get to the kennedy jackson s fighter flew badly would not hold course in any specific attitude he had to adjust trim constantly sanchez reported some movement in the aft cockpit maybe it was just the intercom shot out jackson thought hopefully sanchez was ordered to land jackson on the final approach the tomcat started to handle badly the pilot struggled with his fighter planting it hard on the deck and catching the number one wire the right side landing gear collapsed at once and the thirty million dollar fighter

monster why was mother so afraid jase longed to look behind her eyes but he never had before oh her conscious thoughts now and then but nothing deep he was afraid of the way she gnawed her hand and sat slackfaced in the chair when he was nt home and knew the answer to every question he asked her and yet never seemed interested in anything he was afraid instinctively that whatever was in her memories he did not want to know it for he experienced other people s memories as if so that once having dwelt in their minds for a time he could easily become confused about which things that he remembered were actually things that he had done many hours late at night he had lain in his bed letting his mind wander searching the nearby rooms he did not know how to range farther than that with his listening prowling gift no one suspected his intrusions they thought their thoughts held their memories dreamed their dreams as always unaware of this spectator in his memory jase was no virgin with the prurience of childhood he had been man and woman in acts he did not think his neighbors had imagination enough to perform in memory jase had beaten his children killed a man in a riot on a lower level stolen from his employer quietly sabotaged the electrical system all the most memorable painful exhilarating acts of the people whose minds he entered it was the hardest thing about the swipe remembering when he awoke and which things not he did not want his mother s memories to have such force upon him and yet she was too afraid still gnawing at her hand there at the table waiting for the commissary to send them supper why are you so afraid because someone has accused me of having the swipe page deleted page deleted she had unleashed another swipe upon the world you ca nt be

whimpering gnawing on the hand that had just struck him mother to son you re clean you re clean not his son but mine not his but mine but in his mother s mind jason saw that she looked at him with the same eyes that had seen and loved her husband after all jason had homer worthing s face that well known face that face that frightened children in the textbooks in school he was younger thicker of lip gentler in the eyes but he still wore homer s face and his mother both loved and hated him for that she stood in the middle of the room facing the door and jason saw that she was seeing homer as if he had come back to her as if he smiled at her and said it was all a misunderstanding and i ve come back to make you whole again jase swallowed the blood in his mouth and got off his bed walked around mother and stood in front of her she did her husband and he reached out to her reached out and touched her cheek and said uyula i love you and she took a step toward him into his embrace mother said jason she shuddered her vision cleared and she saw that it was not her husband she held but her son and his mouth was bleeding she dissolved into sobs clung to him pulled him to the floor and wept upon him touching his bleeding lips kissing him saying over and over i m sorry i m so sorry you were ever born will you ever forgive me i forgive you jason whispered for letting me be born mother is insane said jason silently she is insane and she knows i have the swipe and if they interrogate her we both are dead he had to go to school the next day if he stayed away he come to his home where they would find uyul who was nobody except homer worthing s wife uyul the monster s wife that was the name he found inside his mother s head i wish i had never looked he thought again and again all night he lay awake for a long time and awoke often always trying to think of a solution that was not terrifyingly desperate go into hiding become a wall rat he did not know how the people with uncoded hands survived on capitol living in the ventilation shafts and stealing whatever they could no he would have to go to school face it down they had no proof he had answered the question himself pretty much as long as his genes did nt show it torrock had no proof that he was a swipe so he left his mother in the morning and dozed in the worm on the way to school he went to his morning classes as usual ate the day and then the headmaster came and invited him to his office what about history jase asked trying to act unconcerned the rest of your classes today are cancelled torrock was waiting in the headmaster s office he looked pleased with himself we have prepared a test it s no more difficult than the one you took yesterday except that i did nt write the questions i do nt know the answers someone will be with you all the time if you could perform an act of genius yesterday surely you can do it again today jason looked at the headmaster
too why she had nt told him she knew he had to decide for himself when the night faded to shades of gray he and a small recording device slung on his belt exhaustion had brought its own kind of peace spent he sank down at the foot of a wide beech tree near the clearing the first glow of the new sun began to color the hills he crushed a blade of grass with his sore fingers rolling it between them inhaling its sharp sweet smell it was good to be alive what would it be like to not be to not find out what lay beyond the next day to not see thursday to never slide down the hills of april a rabbit rustled at the edge of the blackberry patch nibbled tentatively at a blade of grass thrust cut velvet ears in his direction he felt pity for it it was so small so ephemeral its moments fleeting as he watched but it had to be what it was he reached for the panpipes and blew a melody in a minor key to the little creature it was a theme know just why the theme seemed important to him but somehow it did somehow it told him of the end of things and of beginnings the melody hung in the warm sweet air for a moment and somehow that moment seemed a bit more alive to him then the ideas the variations came tumbling out of his panpipes he laughed and touched the tiny recorder slung from his hip and in his mind he could hear the orchestration swelling strings then the theme whispered from a flute answered by a kleidelphone echoed by the dark double reeds now a muttered tympani a variation by weidner horn it was all there it was all there because it was his lot to create and he realized suddenly that he was outrageously hungry no wonder it was getting late it was time for him to tell them he was going to stay at renascence but only if they d give him breakfast liss had said to him he had taken that thought and turned it over in his mind and accepted it it was a lie he knew that now david began to shake he tried to control it but as he tried the trembling grew worse until it seemed as if his body were trying to fly apart trying to separate itself from its core of hurt with a hand that barely obeyed he threw open the cabin door and rushed out into the dimming light the mountain wilderness pressed in around him making him feel vulnerable and utterly alone it had been a long time since he d felt that way about renascence not since his first days there when the memories of vesta were fresh he looked up in the darkening sky a satellite skimmed faintly overhead and there another for a minute his thoughts shot out of him projecting him into the sky far beyond the satellites to the asteroid he d once called home back to the little boy he nt any use that little boy was gone dead finished it was nearly dark flicking on the little light he carried on his belt he walked on along the familiar paths through dark woods he came to a clearing and began to cut across the grassy meadow something moved once in the shadows and was gone he found the fawn near the soft clay banks of a spring run a bobcat had killed it the cat s prints lay deep in the beam of his light a hemlock branch above the kill bent from the recent weight it had supported the cat had waited watching the fawn in the grass at the edge of the clearing then it had leaped landing on the little deer s spine paralyzing it with sharp claws the fawn lay warm beside him its guts spilling in an obscene heap by his feet he ran his hand over its head its ears he whispered does everything have to die at renascence his soul and left it as ruined as the young deer it was the same fawn he was sure the one he d seen at dawn three weeks ago leaving it he stumbled away toward the spot where he d waited alone that morning he felt a grim satisfaction that the bobcat would go hungry while he was there it would nt dare come back to its meal while a human was around he lowered himself to the damp ground cradling his head in his cupped hands looking at nothing as the moon rose over the back of the mountain the ring he wore pressed into his scalp he raised his hand to his face trying to see the ring in the dim light abruptly he tugged at it meaning to pull it off fling it away as if the action would undo that morning three weeks ago when they d put it on his finger it was too tight he would wear it always he turned his face to the d felt lightheaded and a little shaky when he d stood up in the early light three weeks ago he had narrowed his eyes against the rising sun that reddened the sky over trey mountain the small wooden buildings of renascence lay in the deep shadow of the hills he was hungry he had nt eaten for nearly two days he wiped the dew from his panpipes onto the rough cloth of his outer shirt and hooked the little instrument to his belt across the clearing a fawn browsing at the new grass on the forest s edge froze at his movement he froze too looking at it thinking it s all right all right pretty thing no one here wants to hurt you they stood for a full minute looking at each other then it moved and
gardener said at last this was little more than a whisper but the mike picked it up and transmitted it perfectly the boys sighed a rustle of wind through autumn leaves heck bast was looking around truculently eyes rolling pimples glowing such a deep red that he looked like a boy in the grip of a tropical illness show me an enemy heck bast s face said yeah you go on show me an enemy and just see what happens to him gardener looked up now his mad eyes appeared filled with tears yes we have enemies he repeated twice now the state of indiana has tried to shut me down do you know what the radical humanists can barely stand to think of me down here at the sunlight home teaching my boys to love jesus and their country it makes em mad and you want to know a deep old dark secret they leaned forward eyes on sunlight gardener we do nt just make em mad gardener said in a hoarse conspirator s whisper we make em scaaaaaared hallelujah oh yeah amen in a flash sunlight gardener grabbed the mike again and he was off up and down back and forth sometimes he jigged a two step neat aspa minstrel in a cakewalk he bopped the word to them pumping one arm first at the boys then up toward heaven where god had presumably dragged up his armchair to listen we scare em oh yeah scare em so bad they got to have another cocktail or another joint or another sniff of cocaine we scare em because even smart old god denying jesus hating radical humanists like them can smell righteousness and the love of god and when they smell that they can smell the brimstone coming out of smell oh no so they send down an extra inspector or two to plant garbage under the kitchen counters or to let loose some cock a roaches in the flour they start a lot of vile rumors about how my boys are beaten are you beaten no they roared indignantly and jack was dumbfounded to see morton roaring the negative out as enthusiastically as all the rest even though a bruise was already beginning to form on morton s cheek why they sent down a bunch of smart news reporters from some smart radical humanist news show sunlight gardener cried in a kind of disgusted wonder they came down here and they said okay who are we supposed to do the hatchet job on we ve done a hundred and fifty already we re experts at smearing the righteous do nt worry about us just give us a few joints and a few cocktails and point us in the right direction but we fooled em almost vicious assent they did nt find no one chained to a beam in the barn did they did nt find no boys in strait jackets like they heard down in town from some of those hellbound school board jackals did they did nt find no boys getting their fingernails pulled or all their hair shaved off or nothing like that most they could find was some boys who said they got spanked and they did get spanked oh yeah they was spanked and i d testify on that matter myself before the throne of almighty god with a lie detector strapped to each arm because the book says if you spare that rod you gon na spoil that child and if you believe that boys you gim me hallelujah hallelujah even the indiana board of education much as they d like to get rid of me and leave a clear field for the devil even they had to admit that when it comes to spanking runs just about the same that if you spare that rod you gon na spoil that child they found happy boys they found healthy boys they found boys who were willing to walk the lord and talk the lord oh can you say hallelujah they could can you say oh yeah they could do that too sunlight gardener came back to the podium the lord protects those that love him and the lord is not gon na see a bunch of dope smoking communist loving radical humanists take away this resting place for tired confused boys there were a few boys who told tattletale lies to those so called news people gardener said i heard the lies repeated on that tv news show and although the boys slinging that mud were too cowardly to show their own faces on the screen i knew oh yeah i knew those voices when you ve fed a boy when you ve held his head tenderly against your breast why i guess then you know his voice those boys are gone now god may forgive them i hope he does oh yeah but sunlight gardener is just a man he hung his head to show what a shameful admission this was but when he raised it again his eyes were still hot sparkling with fury sunlight gardener can not forgive them so sunlight gardener set them out on the road again they have been sent out into the territories but there they shall not be fed there even the trees may eat them up like beasts which walk in the night terrified silence in the room behind the glass panel even casey looked pallid and strange the book says that god sent cain out to the east of eden into the land of nod being cast out onto the road is like that my boys you have a safe haven here he surveyed them but if you weaken woe unto you hell awaits the backslider just as it awaits the boy or man who dives into it on purpose remember boys remember let us pray pit took jack less than a week to decide that a detour into the territories was the
yes he d admitted i just wanted to see if she was comfort able how many times did you look in on her once she was asleep she was fine mrs harnick and mrs drury both thought they saw you but mrs drury said it was at five after three and mrs harnick was sure it was later mrs harnick is wrong i only stopped in once they had to believe him half the time mrs harnick was almost senile but the rest of the time she was very sharp he suddenly picked up the newspaper again he d taken the metro home an old woman carrying a shopping bag and leaning on a cane had been on the platform he d been about to go the express roared into the station the crowd had surged forward and a young fellow his arms filled with schoolbooks had nearly knocked the old lady over as he rushed to get a seat he recalled how he had helped her into the train just before the doors closed are you all right he had asked oh yes my i was afraid i d fall young people are so careless not like in my day they are cruel he said softly the young man got off at dupont circle and crossed the plat form he had followed him managed to get next to him as he stood at the front of the crowd right at the edge of the platform as the train approached he had stepped behind him and jostled his arm so that one of the books began to slip the young man grabbed for it off balance as he was it was easy to push him forward the book and newspaper yes here it was on page three nineteen year old student killed by metro the account called the death an accident a bystander had seen a book slip from the student s arm he had bent forward to retrieve it and lost his balance the coffee cup in arthur s hands had grown cold he would make a fresh cup then get to work there were so many helpless old people in the nursing home waiting for his attention his mind had been on patricia traymore that was why he had nt been more careful about mrs gillespie tomorrow he d tell glory he had to work late and he d go back to patricia traymore s house he had to get in again glory wanted her doll back at ten o clock on the twenty fourth pat set off for richmond the sun had come out strong and golden but the air was still very cold it would be a frosty christmas after leaving the highway she took three wrong turns and became thoroughly it was a street of comfortable medium sized tudor style houses number was larger than its neighbors and had a carved sign antiques on the lawn catherine grapey was waiting in the doorway she was about fifty with a square face deep set blue eyes and a sturdy slim body her graying hair was straight and blunt cut she shook pat s hand warmly i feel as though i know you i go on buying trips to new england fairly often and whenever i got the chance i watched your program the downstairs was used as a showroom chairs couches vases lamps paintings oriental carpets china and fine glassware were all marked with tags a queen anne breakfront held delicate figurines a sleepy irish setter his dark red hair generously sprinkled with gray was asleep in front of it i live upstairs mrs graney explained technically the shop is closed but someone phoned and asked if she could stop in for you pat took off her coat she looked around studying the contents of the room you have beautiful things i like to think so mrs graney looked pleased i love searching out antiques and restoring them my workshop is in the garage she poured coffee from a sheffield pot and handed a cup to pat and i have the pleasure of being surrounded by beautiful things with that auburn hair and gold blouse you look as though you belong on that chippendale couch thank you pat realized she liked this outspoken woman there was something direct and honest about her it made it possible to get right to the point of the visit mrs graney you can understand that your letter was quite startling but will you tell me why you did nt contact the network directly instead of writing to me catherine graney took a sip of coffee as i told you i integrity in your work and i did nt think you would willingly help to perpetuate a lie that s why i m appealing to you to make sure that george graney s name is not mentioned on the jennings program and that abigail jennings does not refer to pilot error in connection with willard s death my husband could fly anything that had wings pat thought of the already edited segments for the program the senator had denounced the pilot but had she actually mentioned his name pat was nt sure but she did remember some of the details of the accident did nt the investigation findings indicate that your husband was flying too low she asked the plane was flying too low and went into the mountain when abigail jennings started using that crash as a means for getting her name in the paper as a spokesperson for airline safety regulations i should have objected immediately pat watched as the irish setter seeming to sense the tension in his mistress the room and settled at her feet catherine leaned over and patted him why did nt you speak up immediately many reasons i had a baby a few weeks after the accident and i suppose i wanted to be considerate of willard s mother willard s mother yes you
and then quietly they stepped inside it was a small presbyterian church on the residential a sunday school that was well filled and as the black faces began to file in every man and woman in the church turned around there was a look of complete shock on everyone the organ stopped one woman fainted another began to scream and within a matter of moments all hell broke loose the minister began to shout someone ran to call the police and only dr clarke s volunteers remained calm standing solidly along the back wall causing no trouble at all as people turned and jeered hurled insults at them even though they were in church within moments the town s tiny squad of riot police had arrived they had been recently trained for the sit ins that had begun to occur and were mostly composed of highway patrolmen but they began to push and shove and drag the uncooperating black bodies out as they made themselves limp and allowed themselves to be dragged away and suddenly tana realized what was happening to them she was next it was happening to us and to her and suddenly two enormous policemen hovered over her and grabbed her roughly by both arms waving their sticks in her face you should be ashamed of yourself white trash her eyes were huge as they dragged her off and with every ounce of her being she wanted to hit and bite and kick thinking of richard blake and how he had been killed but she did nt dare they threw her into the back of the truck with much of dr clarke s group and half an hour later she was being fingerprinted and she was in jail she sat in a jail cell for the rest of the day with fifteen other girls all of them black and she could see sharon across the way they had each been allowed one phone call the whites at least the blacks were still being processed according to the cops and sharon shouted to her tana did she arrived in yolan at midnight and released sharon and tana simultaneously congratulating them both tana could see that she looked harder and more drawn than she had six months before but she seemed pleased with what the girls had done she was nt even upset when sharon told her the news the next day she was being kicked out of green hill effective immediately her things had already been packed by the housemother of jasmine house and she was being asked to leave the campus before noon tana was in shock when she heard and she knew what she could expect for herself when she was ushered into the dean s office it was just as she had thought she was being asked to leave there would be no scholarship the following year in fact there would be no following year at all like sharon it was all over for her the only difference was that if she was willing to stay on in a probationary state she which would at least mean that she could take her final exams and apply to another school but where she sat in her room in shock after sharon had left sharon was going back to washington with her mother and there had already been talk of her spending a little time as a volunteer for dr king i know daddy ll be mad because he wants me to go to school but you know truthfully tan i ve had it up to here with school she looked sorrowfully at tana then but what about you she was devastated about the price of the sit in for her friend she had never gotten arrested before although they had been warned before the church sit in that it was a real possibility yet she really had nt expected it maybe it s all for the best tana tried to cheer her up and she was still in shock when sharon left and she sat alone in her room until dark jasmine house keep to her room at night and avoid all social activities including the freshman prom she was a pariah of sorts but she also knew that school would be over in three weeks the worst of it was that as they had warned tana they would they informed jean she called hysterical that night sobbing into the phone why did nt you tell me that little bitch was black what difference does it make what color she is she s my best friend but tears filled tana s eyes and the emotions of the past few days overwhelmed her suddenly everyone at school was looking at her as though she had killed someone and sharon was gone she did nt know where she would go to school next year and her mother was screaming at her it was like being five years old and being told you had been very very bad but not being sure why you call that she cost you your scholarship and got you kicked out of school and do you think you ll get accepted anywhere else after this of course you will you jerk harry reassured her through her sobs the next day shit there are zillions of radicals at bu i m not a radical she cried some more i know that all you did was go to a sit in for chrissake it s your own goddamn fault for going to that prissy redneck school i mean shit you are nt even in the civilized world down there why the hell do nt you come up here to school you really think i might be able to get in with your grades are you kidding they d let you run the place you re just trying to make me feel better she started to cry again you re giving me a mammoth pain just let
our pesos happily i got in the front seat of the massive old buick station wagon repainted many times now the bright red of the flag of aztlan in fact aztlan s red flag with the gold radiant sun in the center snapped from both front fenders and the radio antenna jim was jammed in the back with three other people all wearing yellow cards estacion de la autobuses del norte por favor i said my spanish is less than minimal as these impressions of el paso the cemetery beneath the complex tangle of the spaghetti bowl where i intersects the expressway is in prewar condition unlike the situation common in dallas new graves have not been dug in among the old but there are many empty buildings empty houses and abandoned cars just before we turned onto piedras we saw along the side of i the glittering aluminum ruins of a jet cracked plastic windows in the few bits of intact fuselage the plane s markings no longer readable japanese soldiers passed us in squat toyota military vehicles their light khaki uniforms were spotless the rising sun on their shoulders as they rode along they shot pictures of the distant franklin mountains with minoltas as small and thin as credit cards earlier we had noticed a restaurant with the odd name gunther s lotus blossom a closer look revealed that the sign had once read gunther s edelweiss before warday the u s army used to train soldiers of the german federal road from here we wondered if gunther was still around or if he had left only his name behind japanese military planes flew low overhead they were odd looking things with their wings canted forward instead of swept back so that they appeared to be flying backwards instead of a jet s familiar scream they made a low drumming noise that seemed almost to thump your chest i recall the strange cant of the wings from nasa designs for future hypersonic aircraft we had ridden in silence for some time when the driver decided to try striking up a conversation hey gringo he said with a big smile let s talk norteamericano see if i can still do it his name was carlos leon and he was from san antonio i m from there too i said so is he i nodded toward jim hey compadres i grew up there left in to get a job out there were lots of jobs here again i was managing a mcdonald s kept at it too until the meat stopped getting delivered then i said the hell with the franchise sold the equipment and signed up as a cooperator they assigned me to pesetas and gave me a permit to buy a station wagon our co op consists of me my wife the bookkeeper and my cousin the mechanic where did you live in san antonio west side i lived on south zarzamora my dad was a garbage man but not in his own neighborhood we had to take our garbage to the dump ourselves until the fifties my mom and dad died in san antonio i lived in terrell hills i said rich eh my dad was an oilman oh boy you re poor now eh i see you work with your hands i m poor now for you join the rest of the world i laugh no more oilmen hey that s good no more oilmen just british and israeli oil import agents right i did not mention that texas oil was flowing again and that refineries were opening up all over the united states there was a razor edge of anger among these people this was their place their time at last and these their days of sunshine walls pockmarked with bullet holes were a common sight as we neared the center of town jim and i went to central i said hoping carlos might also be an alumnus this is not as unlikely as it sounds central catholic had a substantial hispanic population when we attended the sudden silence tells me that my suspicion is correct carlos stops the car well goddamn brother halaby shit yeah brother arafia the spider the spider taught world history and his real name was brother gordon but his thin six foot four frame gained him the nickname brother arafla so total was his identification with us that he was known to get mean when freshmen called him brother gordon i m brother arafia he would snarl and do nt you forget it carlos had been five years ahead of us at central you remember brother deloach he asked he was principal our freshman year he retired he taught me a hell of a lot i was a real bad kid when i went there angry you know and so damn stupid i d been a year at southton already they hit me with a razor strap there i was down for selling grass shining shoes and dealing grass to the soldiers on alamo plaza then going to the alameda to see cantinflas movies you know what we got for a joint we called them mary janes but they cost us eighty five cents apiece so we were risking years of freedom for fifteen cents sure enough the next thing i knew i was down for a year and my mom and dad were thinking they had raised a rotten kid when i got out i applied to central no way i m gon na get in my parents figure i m fourteen and already a jailbird but deloach he lets me in you stay away from the mary janes or i ll paddle your behind he says you re a smart kid that s your problem we ll give you a little something to do with your mind you ll stay out of trouble did it work i loved that school one of these days i m gon na
inflating blobbily behind me just how far away are you it firmed beneath me more than nine thousand light years she toyed with something that was gold and thin black nobs on both ends pencil microphone letter opener that s a rather costly hyperwave projection just to say hello we have forty minutes conference time marq a few seconds out for nostalgia wo nt hurt we ll let it go at that i had some good memories of japril her insight her ambition i also had reason to wonder if some of her memories of me were not so pleasant i d thought you d be somebody calling to chide me about my current cargo but this has got to be about some past crime of mine if not some crime to come spiders all think industrial diplomacy is a crime they may be right japril went from smile to grin with those big teeth of hers actually it s neither her fingers came together on the golden bar calculator energy knife water purifier relax what do you know of rhyonon a memory of clym and a chill only that no one is supposed to know that much about it funny thing about that chill it did nt subside there s something permanently scary about an entire world s death the rescue operations the few thoundsand we got out say or the few colony ships the web managed to load up in hours and evacuate during the course of the disaster the survivors we managed to pry out of the peripheral ruins and smoking wreckage once the major conflagration was over the web is information it s silly to lie to a spider especially one with that many rays rainbowing her sunburst nothing i know she said there were nt any at least of those see what i mean you want to know where i am japril s fingers moved absently on the stick sound recorder cosmetics case musical instrument possibly having something to do with it possibly not minors blanked out among us reflections vanished behind japril a wide indistinct window looked out on a brown landscape boxed and blotted with architectural oddities some angular some freeform many connected by arching i m at a rescue station on the sixth moon of chyvon in the tyon omega system chyvon s a gas giant one out from rhyonon within an hour of the catastrophe a rescue station was set up on rhyonon s nearest moon and an overflow station here then some did get out hearing as i said it how ridiculous it sounded with two years planning you can lift a few thousand women from one world and relocate them on another how many can you evacuate within minutes the station on rhyonon s moon was closed down to a skeleton staff within a hundred hours after the catastrophe i would have thought that the majority of the refugees i felt strange calling the survivors of an entire world refugees would have been brought to the nearer station the reason we maintain the skeleton staff on rhyonon s moon is at least to suggest to those who re suggestible the possibility of is nt one as far as illusions go it s pretty paltry believe me i was nt in favor of it when it was decided on japril i said are there any survivors at all she took a long time to say yes and they re not on rhyonon s moon but rather on that moon of chyvon with you she took an even longer time to nod throwing me to all those far flung cultures where a nod does not necessarily signal affirmation but they were not japril s nonchalantly as i could manage i asked how many one reason japril became friends with me in the first place is because of her uncanny ability to see through my diplomatic masks why do nt i tell you instead your relation to this survivor marq you mean this woman is a factor in my life of a notable relation and do nt discount rumor it s the real order of business this evening where i was i was thinking of it this afternoon but no matter i ve noted that relation and the web wants to exploit it which is why you ve called on me to talk about it across nine thousand light years one reason i became friends with japril is because of how quickly her ambitious and devious plans open all their exfoliations to my view there is a survivor is nt there at least one really i was thinking of clym far more than the various suggestions japril had all but thrown in front of me we ve had rat korga here at the station for there was relief in her voice as she said the name to me for the first time and i got a sense that this was something she had not talked about with many people and that circle was something she had wanted to do for well for a while now let me tell you about rhyonon marq sit back and i ll catalogue the horrors i ve done it in enough reports that i can recite it in my sleep the flame shell japril said where it roared across rhyonon s surface was over fifty thousand feet high which effectively did in any passing air travel most of the actual holocaust was confined to the equatorial areas so was ninety percent of rhyonon s population the resultant gaseous toxins alone not to mention the incredible heatstorms that went raging out north and south pretty wets mu in use parts of the world that were not directly burned winds over the whole planet rose to nearly six hundred kilometers an hour in ten hours the major flaming areas had more or less burned themselves out with twelve percent of the planetary surface fused and the atmosphere radically deoxygenated
back into the woods babe broke into a trot at the sound of the shots it was important to warn uncle alton about what her father had said but it was more interesting to find out what he had bagged oh he d bagged it all right uncle alton never fired without killing this was about the first time she had ever heard him blast away like that must be a bear she thought excitedly tripping over a root sprawling rolling to her feet again without noticing the tumble she d love to have another bearskin in her room where would she put it maybe they could line it and she could have it for a blanket uncle alton evening oh no no not with this trouble between him and dad oh if she could only do something she tried to run faster worried and anticipating but she was out of breath and went more slowly instead at the top of the rise by the edge of the woods she stopped and looked back far down in the valley lay the south thirty she scanned it carefully looking for her father the new furrows and the old were sharply defined and her keen eyes saw immediately that cory had left the line with the cultivator and had angled the team over to the shade trees without finishing his row that was nt like him she could see the team now and cory s pale blue denim was nowhere in sight she giggled lightly to herself as she thought of the way she would fool her father and the little sound of laughter drowned out for her the sound of alton s hoarse dying scream she reached and the shots came from up around here somewhere she stopped and listened several times and then suddenly heard something coming toward her fast she ducked under cover terrified and a little baby faced man in black his blue eyes wide with horror crashed blindly past her the leather case he carried catching on the branches it spun a moment and then fell right in front of her the man never missed it babe lay there for a long moment and then picked up the case and faded into the woods things were happening too fast for her she wanted uncle alton but she dared not call she stopped again and strained her ears back toward the edge of the wood she heard her father s voice and another s probably the man who had dropped the brief case she dared not go over there filled with enjoyable terror she thought hard then snapped her fingers in triumph she and alton had played injun many times up here they practiced birdcalls until she knew them better than the birds themselves what would it be ah blue jay she threw back her head and by some youthful alchemy produced a nerve shattering screech that would have done justice to any jay that ever flew she repeated it and then twice more the response was immediate the call of a blue jay four times spaced two and two babe nodded to herself happily that was the signal that they were to meet immediately at the place the place was a hide out that he had discovered and shared with her and not another soul knew of it an angle of rock beside a stream not far away it was nt exactly a cave but almost enough so to he entrancing babe trotted happily away toward the brook she had just known that uncle alton would remember the call of the blue jay and what it meant in the tree that arched over alton s scattered body perched a large jay bird of the presence of death hardly noticing babe s realistic cry it screamed again four times two and two it took cory more than a moment to recover himself from what he had seen i le turned away from it and leaned weakly against a pine panting alton that w as alton lying there in parts god god god god gradually his strength returned and he forced himself to turn again stepping carefully he bent and picked up the its barrel was bright and lean but the butt and stock were smeared with some kind of stinking rottenness where had he seen the stuff before somewhere no matter he cleaned it off absently throwing the beliruled bandanna away afterward through his mind tan alton s words was that only last night i m goin to start trackin an i m inn to keep trackin till i find the one done this job he found alton s box of shells the box was wet and sticky that made it better somehow a bullet wet with alton s blood was the right thing to use he went away a short distance circled around till he found heavy footprints then came back i m a trackin for you bud he whispered thickly and began through the brush he followed its wavering spoor amazed at the amount of filthy mold about gradually associating it with the thing that had killed his brother there was nothing in the world for him anymore but hate and doggedness cursing himself for not getting alton home last night he followed the tracks to the edge of the woods they led him to a big tree there and there he saw something else the footprints of the little city man nearby lay some tattered scraps of linen and what was that another set of prints small ones small stub toed ones somewhere a blue jay called babe stopped and turned when she heard her father s voice faint with distance piercing listen at him holler she crooned delightedly gee he sounds mad she sent a jay bird s call disrespectfully back to him and hurried to the place it consisted

some thunderstorm had blown through the pride s corridor and the sun had come out again but then haral pyanfar turned abruptly hilfy stood there with a pistol in hand what do you think you re doing

back to the bridge and into the galley what he want tully asked worried looking half rising from the table but pyanfar pushed him down again her hand on his shoulder nothing but nuisance he give money want me he down onto the bench and reached for her abandoned cup so what did he want khym took the cup before her hand got there and slid a hot one into her hand good khym said she looked up at her husband puzzled good khym said again meaning just she thought good job she doubted it but she sipped the gfi and looked up at him she saw patience in his amber eyes patience he had won the hard way your cabin s taken she said pointedly huh he looked embarrassed at the invitation when he had realized it geran was there another male was then he looked pleased in spite of himself his ears flicked gods tc a methane breathers she remembered the knnn that had paced them out of meetpoint and the hair wanted to stand up on her back again something he said was important something was worth the trip here him would be lord assume we are allies remember this at kefk something wrong he asked revenge on all our enemies hani there will be a day you want it not yet she said she caught the plastic wrapped confection geran spun her way on the tabletop haral and tirun blundered back in hunting gfi and food she tore the plastic and swallowed the mince in hunks guaranteed to make for hiccups she chased it with gfi gods tofi the spice made her sneeze slow down for the gods sake what slow down we ve got eight and a half hours to sleep she stood up and grabbed khym s arm come on husband suddenly i m in the mood gods py who notices finish the gfi come on eight and a half hours was not enough the alarm went off like attack and mayhem and but there was nothing for it then but to remember where she was and what there was waiting and to pull herself and her half conscious husband out of bed and face it she faced it in a plain twill pair of blue trousers common spacer like because they were headed out and other side of that jump was likely no time for washup or amenities she saved her brightest silk pair for after cleanup on the docks at kefk healthiest to think in those terms that there would be the need of red silk trousers and all the finery but she did put on the ruby pendant earring among the others that winked and shone ferociously in the red gold sweep of her tufted

ordered tirun when she found her on the bridge feed it what tirun asked know thaw something throw a steak through the door do nt get near it and do nt carry weapons gods it s just one kif i can do nt go near it how much more trouble do we need on this ship aye tirun said and swallowed all further argument they were all up all functioning chur came out from khym s former cabin to sit check out on the bridge haral and hilfy and geran arrived from below and tully came up too stiff and sore and pottering about the galley with khym gods and hilfy getting breakfast on the bridge the comflow started and the pride began to drink down the information aja jin and vigilance had been awake through the downwatches composing haral and geran and chur were in charge there while tirun went off to kif

want to see him now it s important there were few inmates in the prison who could have gotten away with it but big bertha was one of them the prison authorities were well aware of her power they had seen her start riots and they had seen her stop them no prison in the world could be run without the cooperation of the inmate leaders and big bertha was a leader she had been seated in the warden s outer office for almost an hour her huge a disgusting looking creature the warden s secretary thought she gives me the creeps how much longer big bertha demanded it should nt be too much longer he has a group of people in with him the warden s very busy this morning big bertha said he s gon na be busier she looked at her watch twelve forty five plenty of time it was a perfect day cloudless and warm and the singing breeze carried a tantalizing mixture of scents across the green farmland tracy had spread out a tablecloth on a grassy area near the lake and amy was happily munching on an egg salad sandwich tracy glanced at her watch it was already she could not believe it the morning had dragged and the afternoon was winging by she had to think of something quickly or time was going to steal away her last chance at freedom one ten in the warden s reception office warden brannigan s secretary i m sorry the warden says it s impossible for him to see you today we ll make another appointment for big bertha pushed herself to her feet he s got to see me it s we ll fit you in tomorrow big bertha started to say tomorrow will be too late but she stopped herself in time no one but the warden himself must know what she was doing snitches suffered fatal accidents but she had no intention of giving up there was no way she was going to let tracy whitney get away from her she walked into the prison library and sat down at one of the long tables at the far end of the room she scribbled a note and when the matron walked over to an aisle to help an initiate big bertha dropped the note on her desk and left when the matron returned she found the note and opened it she read it twice you no signature a hoax the matron had no way of knowing she picked up the telephone get me the superintendent of guards one fifteen you re not eating amy said you want some of my sandwich no leave me alone she had not meant to speak so harshly amy stopped eating are you mad at me tracy please do nt be mad at me i love you so much i never get mad at you her soft eyes were filled with hurt i m not angry she was in hell i m not hungry if you re not let s play ball tracy and amy pulled her rubber ball out of her pocket one sixteen she should have been on her way it would take her at least fifteen minutes to get to the utility room she could just make it if she hurried but she and in the far distance she saw a group of trusties picking crops instantly tracy knew what she was going to do do nt you want to play ball tracy tracy rose to her feet yes let s play a new game let s see who can throw the ball the farthest i ll throw the ball and then it will be your turn tracy picked up the hard rubber ball and threw it as far as she could in the direction of the workers oh that s good amy said admiringly that s real far i ll go get the ball tracy said you wait here and she was running running for her life her feet flying across the fields it was if she was late they would wait for her or would they she ran faster behind her she heard amy calling but she paid no attention now tracy yelled at them and they stopped she was breathless when she reached them anythin wrong one of them asked no n nothing she was panting fighting for breath the little girl back there one of you look after her i have something important i have to do i she heard her name called from a distance and turned amy was standing on top of the concrete wall surrounding the lake she waved look at me tracy no et down tracy screamed and as tracy watched in horror amy lost her balance and plunged into the lake oh dear god the blood drained from tracy s face she had a choice to make but there was no choice i ca nt help her not now someone will save her i have to save myself i ve got to get out of this tracy turned and began running as fast as she had ever run in her life the others were calling after her but she did not hear them she flew through the air unaware that her shoes had fallen off not caring that the sharp ground was cutting into her feet her heart was pounding and her lungs were bursting and she pushed herself to run faster faster she reached the wall around the lake and vaulted on top of it far below she could see amy in the deep terrifying water struggling to stay afloat without a second s hesitation tracy jumped in after her and as she hit the water tracy thought oh my god i ca nt swim new orleans friday august a m lester torrance a teller at the first merchants bank orleans prided himself on two things his sexual prow the ladies and his ability to
misrule nonetheless babcock paid them more than their due he made a very low bow to the tiers and another to those standing and then said they should all presently witness a spectacle of ursine puissance not to be matched at the bear gardens of southwark or by other famous bears of the town he then proceeded to name this boast provoked many a cynical guffaw and denial from the impatient crowd meanwhile the dogs who had been confined in a small enclosure in front of joan began to bark and whine so that babcock s final remarks before disappearing into samson s tent were completely lost on the crowd these same dogs had been raised to such a pitch of excitement by the humannoise and the smell of the bear that they now were practically beyond the control of their keepers they began to fight with each other and their keepers were at great trouble to separate the most belligerent of them at last one of the animals a particularly scrappy little spaniel was so quite unfit to fight the bear and had to be removed meanwhile joan only vaguely aware of these happenings and caring less continued to search for her husband in the crowd her searching was by eye alone for she was unable to move from where she stood it was not therefore that she could have done anything had she seen him but just seeing him and seeing him whole would have been sufficient at this moment for she had a terrible fear that somehow he had been swallowed up in the multitude and she should have to go back to chelmsford alone with not even his dead body for company the quarreling dogs had caused a delay in the proceedings but their owners had now regained control and still the bear did not appear the crowd began to boo and hiss and presently francis crisp came out of the tent and made motions for them to be quieter his efforts were futile the uproar increased crisp went back inside the tent a moment later of which was samson who was wagging his shaggy head and thrusting his nose forward in the air to sniff out the scent of the dogs at the appearance of samson the crowd s boos turned into cheers crisp chained the bear to the tethering stake and as if on cue samson rose to his hind legs and stood manlike pawing the air as though saluting the assembly like an old roman gladiator about to give mortal battle it s no wonder he could kill a man someone said near to joan by which she understood the word had spread about the dead man joan felt yet another chill of apprehension she futilely stared about her in a renewed effort to find matthew a short thickset man in a loose fitting shirt led his dogs forward and unleashed them one by one so that each animal sprang forward into a position just beyond the extent of the bear s swing the crowd roared samson glared at the dogs with his small eyes and then took a mighty swing on the side of its head and sending it flying to within a few feet of the paling while the dog lay stunned by the blow his confederates now joined the attack and in the fray that followed joan could not hear the sound of dog or bear for the boisterous enthusiasm of the crowd for this bloody spectacle samson was now on his hind feet pawing the air threateningly bellowing and flailing at the attacking dogs one spaniel more courageous than the rest attacked the bear directly and for a moment hung upon his chest his teeth fastened into the thick fur until samson caught the creature in a hug that crushed the dog s spine then let him drop at his feet in the meantime the other dogs were circling snarling and lunging alert for any part of the bear s anatomy that they might attack with impunity their fangs were bare and dripping with saliva their eyes intense the bear swung round and round letting fly with his arms again with a threatening suddenness samson caught one dog on the side of the head and sent him sprawling into the dust his head a bloody pulp the bear shredded the fur from another s back and broke the forelegs of a third before the remaining attackers recognizing the superiority of bear to dog despite their numbers began to lose enthusiasm for the fight scampering over the bodies of their fallen kennel mates they went whimpering back to their crestfallen master who gave the bloodied survivors a few good kicks for their pains the conclusion of the fight brought frenzied applause from all sides as onlookers scrambled to collect their winnings which evidently were based on both the winner of the combat bear or dog and on the extent of the destruction three dogs fallen out of the brace of half dozen who had commenced the attack but joan thought the whole spectacle the most disgusting she had ever witnessed the fight confirmed what she had long believed that here was the most abominable of sports for as she was for matthew s safety and disgusted at the spectacle before her she was now forced to stand as witness to this carnage while god only knew what mortal mischief her husband might be subject to assuming as she did that he was somewhere within the confines of the bear garden while bear and hound tore at each other with tooth and nail to the delight of the multitude joan could think only of the deadly blade so vividly described in esmera s vision a vision enacted for her again every time one of the drunken louts she was wedged between jabbed an elbow in her ribs or shoved her from behind in the general excitement it was with great relief
ways can be amicable but amicable or not it is occurring if rapture had been dependent she was so no more mym was so angry at this betrayal that he could not even speak in singsong well farewell she said and turned and walked away now mym saw thanatos in the adjacent chamber ready to convey rapture back to the realm of the mortals she had come only to inform mym of her decision mym tasted blood in his mouth in his rage he had bitten his tongue now that blood was triggering a rage of a different nature he would deal with this john of hers he grasped the red sword and willed himself to the mortal realm he knew where rapture worked and where she lived from there he should be able to trace this mortal man john but then he paused was he the incarnation of war to to hurt the one he loved or had loved or thought he had loved how much of his ideal of peace would he be spreading that way and this john surely an innocent young man for rapture would not have told a mortal about her relation to an immortal a man who liked rapture very well who probably needed her more than she needed him and wanted to get to know her as well as he could mym reversed his course no he had no need and no desire to hurt rapture or her friend he would set the example that he wished mortals would follow and accept the inevitable with what grace he could muster he returned to his castle and walked in the garden severely out of sorts it was true that he and rapture had been growing apart and her initiative had been valid but he had discovered the joy of loving and being loved with orb and rediscovered it with rapture he could no longer countenance being appeared so she dumped you she said damn her except that she was already damned no thanks to you demoness he said she was nt right for you anyway lila said maybe she was when you were playing the prince princess game among the mortals but not for this situation you need a woman who understandsabout incarnations true i shall look for one she smiled inhaling she now wore one of her translucent outfitsthat were more maddeningly suggestive than full nudity would have been no mortal will do mym you need one who is committed to the afterlife thanatos seems to do well enough with a mortal thanatos has a quite remarkable mortal there is not another like luna you err demoness there is her cousin orb plila shrugged eloquently that s right you had an affair with her did nt you but back i m not so sure i loved her before and she loved me i could love her again lila paced in front of him allowing her flesh to quiver provocatively you finished that relationship when you deserted her for another woman that was not my choice nevertheless you left her in a rather difficult situation you see she was gravid gravid with child it happens to mortals you know pregnant she could nt have been verify it in fate s threads mym she was carrying your baby girl and she bore her after you left and gave her up for adoption that rather finished that aspect of your romance i doubt very much that she would choose to go through that again but she never said anything to me she did nt know it when you deserted her mym was stricken of the afterlife do nt get gravid with them it s all pleasure no consequence so why do nt you become sensible and do what you have been longing to do for so long she shimmered and her clothing dissolved into mist she opened her arms i can be most accommodating mym and i make no demands he looked at her this creature of hell seemed on the verge of victory at last her body was beautiful but her nature demonic he trusted her to serve her master and her master was satan he tasted the blood in his mouth again this time he let the berserker reflex take over abruptly he was moving his great red sword was out and whistling it lopped off her head the head flew up its face surprised the body remained standing there was no blood the sword whistled back it lopped off the upper arms and the top of the torso cleanly at the the neck and the tops of the two breasts also bloodlessly the nether sections of the breasts resembled two bowls filled precisely level with gray stuffing both sections of thatpbosom were expanding for lila had been inhaling at the moment of his attack again the sword passed through severing the body at the slenderwaist and again at the genital region and at the knees five swift cuts and the body was tumbling in six major segments which in turn were fragmenting as the separate arms and legs fell skew in a moment there was simply a collection of items on the ground in this manner too i am ready to serve you the head said it was lying to the side where it had bounced and rolled the truncated neck was up the face inverted i just want to be rid of you mym gritted then stuff my parts in a trunk and ship it straight to hell the head was looking at his sword and finding no blood on the blade his berserker rage had faded being replaced by bemusement he had known that demons differed from people but had not been quite prepared for this use the base of the statue mym went to the copulating statue and hacked off its figures the pedestal now manifested as a hollow chamber he sheathed the sword and wrestled this up it was
you torisen laughed then caught his breath sharply flashing across the road scarcely a dozen paces away was a rage of five rathorns the lead stallion spun around to face the host fangs bared sunlight fell on the blackness of his coat blazed off his two horns and wealth of ivory every war horse in the vanguard rocked back on its heels wild eyed not one would have stood its ground if the great beast had charged instead he gave a scornfulsnort and bounded over the silver after his rage a moment later all whole trinity breathed harn soothing his frightened mount that was quite an omen of what i think the emblem of my house just laughed in my face but where on earth did they come from he dismounted and followed the rathorns path clearly marked by trampled grass ahead there seemed to be nothing but a vine covered cliff face as he drew nearer however torisen saw darkness behind the leaves he pushed the vines aside behind them was the mouth of a tunnel high vaulted lined with smooth expertly fitted stones the shaft seemed to go back a long long way its cold breath heavy with the smells of earth and rathorn breathed in his face a faint confused murmurarose from the black distance almost like the sound of voices hello is anyone there his voice echoed back harshly again and again and again he caught his breath feeling as if he then somewhere far far away someone called his name the unburnt dead come for you out of darkness calling calling and if you answer you are lost but that was only how he and jame used to frighten each other as children it was just a silly game born out of a stupidpsuperstition about as stupid as believing that someone down there in the dark actually knew his name harn called to him from the road blackie here comes ardeth the lord of omiroth was riding up toward the vanguard on his gray whinno hir mare brithany a matriarch of the herd and storm s granddam kindrie the two kendar scrollsmen and ardeth s war guard followed him at a distance harn grunted confrontation time huh i d better take myself off then he cantered back toward the main body of the host saluting ardeth as he passed torisen swung back up onto storm and waited not without some trepidation older man had dressed him down for not honoringhis obligation to kindrie my lord my lady he included both highborn and horse in a wary salute ardeth to his surprise looked almost embarrassed my boy it seems i owe you an apology i did nt know that the changer who attacked you at tentir was a shanir much less that he was bound to a darkling wyrm kindrie saw the wyrm good i was beginning to think that i d imagined it but he waited this long to tell you you never told me at all said ardeth a trifle sharply still what cursed luck that it was a shanir the old blood can be dangerous it opens us up to god born powers few of us still know how to control but is it necessarily so foul a thing say to share senses with an animal now if it were brithany here instead of some crawling no said torisen and gave a startled yelp as the mare nipped his leg sorry my lady forgive me he held out his hand to her she made as if to snap at his fingers but only grazed them with a velvet lip you always were one of her favorites said ardeth smiling that was in part why i took a chance on you in the first place so that s why you introduced us that first night the lord of omiroth taking advice from a gray mare hey storm growing jealous had turned to snap at ardeth s foot brithany put back her ears her grand colt subsided chastened and a bit sulky the idiot child said ardeth regarding him coolly why do nt you look for a full blooded whinno hir i know of at least one three year old in the herd who would be honored to bear you even a battle storm does besides he ll take me straight through a stone wall if i ask him to without an argument as i said an idiot look across the river a flight of azure winged butterflies rose from the tall grass at the sound of the horses hooves then settled back again out of sight jewel jaws said torisen absently there must be somethingdead in the grass he peered ahead down the road holly sbeen gone a long time i sent him ahead to check out the next post station you expect trouble i do nt really know we should have had news from the south before now unless the post rider has been waylaid somewhere along the line or no one escaped to send word ardeth concluded bleakly he turned to watch two more swarms of butterflies dancing above the grass then gave himself a shake your pardon my boy much of death this post system of yours is really remarkable imagine news from the far side of rathillien in only ten days of course if you put the shanir to work on it they might come up with something even faster no ah well have it your way it must be quite a job though protecting stations in this wilderness i have an arrangement with the local warlord one grisharki if he were a grindark like his followers i would trust him more but he comes from the ebonbane and boasts that he was the lieutenant of some famous brigand there named bortis grindark ardeth repeated thoughtfully an odd people that with an even odder connection to us because they re supposed to have been the builders workmen torisen asked oh
her on impulse the way husbands drake never did and he did nt now he merely held her close and whispered why are you so inter ested his hand was almost brutally hard upon the nape of her neck so that she stiffened and tried to draw back her voice was more than a whisper now stop it drake he said i want no questions from you and no interference you do your job and i ll do mine the nature of my job is open and known the nature of my job he retorted is nt by definition but i ll tell you this our six legged friend is here in this house for some definite reason you were nt picked as biologist in charge for any random reason do you know that two days ago he d been inquiring about me at the commission you re joking do nt believe that for a minute there are that s my job and i wo nt discuss it with you any further do you understand no but i wo nt question you if you do nt want me to then go to sleep she lay stiffly on her back and the minutes passed and then the quarter hours she was trying to fit the pieces together even with what drake had told her the curves and colors refused to blend she wondered what drake would say if he knew she had a recording of that night s conversation one picture remained clear in her mind at that moment it hovered over her mockingly the hawkinsite at the end of the long evening had turned to her and said gravely good night mrs smollett you are a most charming hostess she had desperately wanted to giggle at the time how could he call her a charming hostess to him she could only be a horror a monstrosity with too as the hawkinsite delivered himself of this completely meaningless piece of politeness drake had turned white for one instant his eyes had burned with something that looked like terror she had never before known drake to show fear of anything and t t e picture of that instant of pure panic remained with her until all her thoughts finally sagged into the oblivion of sleep it was noon before rose was at her desk the next day she had deliberately waited until drake and the hawkinsite had left since only t hen was she able to remove the small recorder that had been behind drake s armchair the previous evening she had had no original intention of keeping its presence secret from him it was just that he had come home so late and she could nt say anything about it with the hawkinsite present later on of course things had changed the placing of the recorder had been only a routine maneuver the ilawkinsite s statements and intonations needed to be preserved for future intensive studies hidden in order to avoid the distortions of self consciousness that the visibility of such a device would bring and now it could nt be shown to the members of the institute at all it would have to serve a different function altogether a rather nasty function she was going to spy on drake she touched the little box with her fingers and wondered irrelevantly how drake was going to manage that day social intercourse between inhabited worlds was even now not so commonplace that the sight of a hawkinsite on the city streets would not succeed in drawing crowds but drake would manage she knew drake always managed she listened once again to the sounds of last evening repeating the interesting moments she was dissatisfied with what drake had told her why should the hawkinsite have been interested in the two of them particularly yet drake would nt lie she would have liked to check at the security commission but she knew she could not do that besides definitely not lie but then again why should harg tholan not have investigated them he might have inquired similarly about the families of all the biologists at the institute it would be no more than natural to attempt to choose the home he would find most pleasant by his own standards whatever they were and if he had even if he had investigated only the smollettswhy should that create the great change in drake from intense hostility to intense interest drake undoubtedly had knowledge he was keeping to himself only heaven knew how much her thoughts churned slowly through the possibilities of interstellar intrigue so far to be sure there were no signs of hostility or ill feeling among any of the five intelligent races known to inhabit the galaxy as yet they were spaced at intervals too wide for enmity even the barest contact among them was all but impossible economic and political interests just had no point at which to conflict but that was only her idea and she was not conflict if there were danger if there were any reason to suspect that the mission of a hawkinsite might be other than peaceful drake would know yet was drake sufficiently high in the councils of the security commission to know off hand the dangers involved in the visit of a hawkinsite physician she had never thought of his position as more than that of a very minor functionary in the commission he had never presented himself as more and yet might he be more she shrugged at the thought it was reminiscent of twentieth century spy novels and of costume dramas of the days when there existed such things as atom bomb secrets the thought of costume dramas decided her unlike drake she was nt a real policeman and she did nt know how a real policeman would go about it but she knew how such things were done in the old dramas she drew a piece of paper toward her and with
wo nt be here we lost her two years ago she was crossing the medina in a buggy with brother mitchell and some water splashed on her she caught a chill and it turned into lung fever i m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this i just wish that you could have come home after the war was over it would have meant ever so much to mama to see you again do nt misunderstand me johnny i m not blaming you for anything not coming home but we ve all missed you so much please come now if you can always your loving sister mary finally one afternoon in early april he topped out on a low ridge that overlooked the ringgold farm a man was plowing in the lower field by the creek even at a distance he could tell that the man was well above average stature there was something curious about the way he was plowing and after a minute or so john made out that he had only one arm he had himself strapped to the plow in such a way that he could manage it with his single arm but obviously it was a feat beyond the strength of an ordinary man only someone like clayton who had more strength in one arm than most men had in two could keep a straight furrow with that handicap rememberingmary s letter and deeply moved by the sight of clayton struggling with the soil and his handicap john dismounted and watched him for saw a woman come out into the field carrying a pitcher with her was a tiny figure in a dress matching her own slowly the woman trussed the plowed field leading the little girl by the hand claytonpembraced the woman with his one arm and then stooped to lift his daughter after the woman and her daughter returned to the house john noticed a young boy walking along the deep muddy ruts of the road from town over his shoulder he bore a satchel and since he entered the farmhouse it was nt hard to guess that he was clayton s stepson home from school the farm had never looked so lovely to him house and barn were both freshly painted and beneath the windows of the house with their bright blue shutters were flower boxes the surrounding fields watered by abundant spring rains were bright green as green as missouri and there were swatches of wild flowers poppies lupines daisies paintbrush along the creek the cottonwoods he supposed that it had always been this lovely in the spring but as a youngster longing to escape confinement here he had seen none of its beauty he finally swung onto his horse and rode down to where clayton was plowing the fear of being discovered was still with him but as he felt his brother crushing him in a one armed embrace his yearning to be with his family again overcame every other feeling my god big brother where have you been more places than i care to remember clayton he said nearly choking mary said you d be back but we did nt believe her you never wrote us i know clayton during the war i could nt and after that i just did nt but i wo nt stop writing again believe me it do nt matter big brother you re here now and you ai nt leavin us again clayton unharnessed himself from the plow and led his brother across the plowed field to the house on the porch they were met by a small pretty woman with eyes as blue as the cloudless sky above them and a piled up mass of hair as bright gold as a halo clinging to her skirts was a little girl of four or five who with her combed out burnished auburn locks and big inquisitive green eyes was a miniature of judith ringgold mary had nt exaggerated the resemblance you re johnny the girl s mother said before clayton slow spoken as always even had a chance to introduce them clayton and your sisters have never stopped talking about you welcome home she gave him her hand and smiled warmly i m linda she addressed the little girl beside her judith this is your uncle johnny pas he dropped to his heels on the porch step so that he and she could look at each other eye to eye expression of the very young encountering strangers john ringgoldwas filled with an almost unbearable warm sensation and just barely managed to resist the impulse to take the child in his arms first he would teach her to smile at him however long it took then he would take her hand and if she reached out to him after that he would lift her in his arms it did nt take long for the little girl to warm up to her uncle during the days that followed as he worked at various chores to make things easier for his brother clearing an irrigation ditch from the creek mending harness replacing fence posts she was constantly nearby watching him chattering endlessly about the activities of all the creatures on the farm around her from her pet turtle frank to an expecting mother cat and the milk cows you want one of melissa s kittens do nt you johnny she never called him uncle of course take care of it i ll be leaving here soon you ll have to take care of it for me why do you have to leave daddy wants you to stay i know he does and mama too i wish i could stay judith he told her truthfully just being with his brother s family gave him a happiness he had not known since his long visits with the youngers before the war watching them together seeing how linda s son accepted clayton as a father
separated from her by less than the length of an arm i was struck by the contrast between this place and those in which i had spent the rest of this day first yontsdown with its smokestacks and medieval buildings and omnipresent sense of impending doom then the midway with its gaudy pleasures and swarms of marks it was a relief now to pass a little time in a place where there was no proof of man s existence other than the dirt road leading in which we kept at our backs and which i tried to put out of mind gregarious by nature there nevertheless were occasions when i became as weary of the company of other human beings as i was repelled and disgusted by the goblins and sometimes one another as the marks had been in joel tuck s sideshow tent that very day it seemed to me that we deserved the goblins that we were a tragically flawed race incapable of adequately appreciating the miracle of our existence and that we had earned the vicious attentions of the goblins by our own despicable actions against one another after all many of the gods we worshiped were to one degree or another judgmental and demanding and capable of heart stopping cruelty who could say that they might not visit a plague of goblins on us and call it just punishment for sins indulged here in the tranquillity of the forest however a cleansing energy washed through me and gradually i began to feel better in spite of all the talk of graveyards and nightmares with which we had occupied ourselves then after a while i became aware that rya was weeping she made no sound and her body was not racked with silent sobs i was alerted to her condition only when sadness welling up anew in her looking sidewise i saw a glistening tear tracking down her smooth cheek another spot of silver in the moonlight what s wrong i asked she shook her head do nt want to talk she shook her head again acutely aware that she needed comforting that she had come to me expressly for comforting but not knowing how to provide it i turned my eyes from her and looked out at the oily blackness of the lake she shorted out my logic circuits damn it she was different from anyone i had ever known with puzzling depths and dark secrets and it seemed to me that i dared not respond to her as casually and forthrightly as i would have responded to anyone else i felt as if i were an astronaut making first contact with an alien from another world overwhelmed by an appreciation for the gulf between us afraid to proceed lest the initial communication be misunderstood therefore to act i told myself that i had been foolish to dream of heating the coolness between us that i had been an idiot for imagining that a close relationship with her was possible that i had gotten in over my head with this one that these waters were too dark and strange that i would never understand her and and then she kissed me she pressed her pliant lips to mine and her mouth opened to me and i returned her kiss with a passion i had never experienced before our tongues seeking and melting together until i could not tell hers from mine i put both hands in her glorious hair an auburn blond mix in daylight but now argentine and let it run through my fingers it felt the way spun moonlight might feel if it could be fashioned into a cool and silken thread i touched her face and the texture of her skin sent a shiver through me i slid my hands lower along her neck holding her by the her full breasts from the moment she had leaned against me and had given that first kiss she had been shaking i sensed that these were not tremors of erotic anticipation but were evidence of an uncertainty awkwardness shyness and fear of rejection not dissimilar to my own state of mind now suddenly a stronger shiver passed through her she pulled away from me and said oh hell what i asked breathless why ca nt what two people what tears streamed down her face now her voice quavered just reach out to each other you reached i reached and push aside that barrier there s no barrier not now i sensed that sadness in her a well of loneliness too deep to be plumbed a grayness an apartness and i was afraid that moment force upon us the very estrangement that she professed to fear she said it s there always there always so hard to make any real contact any real it s easy i said no we re more than halfway a pit a gulf shut up i said as gently and lovingly as i had ever said two words and i took hold of her again kissed her again we kissed and caressed with rapidly increasing fervor but with a determination to savor this first exploration although we must have sat there on the grass for no more than five or ten minutes it seemed that whole days passed unheeded when she again pulled away from me i started to protest but she said hush in such a way that i knew i should be quiet she rose to her feet and with bring a chill to ardor her clothes slipped away from her and she stood thrillingly revealed even at night in this dark woods she seemed to be the daughter of the sun for moonglow was nothing more than a reflection of solar light and now every beam of that secondhand sunshine appeared to find its way to her the rays of the moon made her skin translucent and accentuated the exquisitely sensuous curves and planes convexities and concavities of
terrain mama made for the humming was louder as she reached the water it came around a bend upstream she could nt see the intruder s shape it was too distant yet but it moved on the water not through it moved fast finally mama s eyes were above the water the snorkel between her eyes drew air her lungs heaved there was rage in her and something else sphincter muscles relaxed back of her neck speed began dripping into her blood and her entire body began to fizz the vulnerable snorkel withdrew into her head sic watched the intruder come not quite toward her she had nt been seen yet then why was the intruder already fast but mama was fast now and she moved this was her territory now she knew it that well she had been here that long mine she too was almost above the water as she reached the intruder she struck from the side for a bare instant she knew that a taste like metal but not as strong ruptured on impact and tore in her jaws no meaty texture no taste of blood not won lost tricked and where was her enemy the metallic skin filled with water and began to sink confusing tastes drifted in its wake things thrashed the water in slow motion beasts caught between fighters she ignored them where was her rival still fast mama streaked for her cave before she could be blindsided at the underwater mouth she turned she could nt be attacked now except from the front now there was time mama lifted her eyes above the water and watched two beasts thrashing if meat were suddenly snatched beneath the surface she would know that her enemy was below but the prey were swept downstream thrashing trying to reach the river s edge they reached shore unmolested and scrambled from the water unmolested mama had been tricked she had bitten something but it was nt meat the other it skimmed across the water almost toward her it swerved away as mama streaked toward it the intruder was fully on speed and young mama thought she herself had never moved so fast but its turn was too slow she was on it and her teeth closed with terrible strength on thin tough tasteless skin and flesh that ruptured and bone that broke fragile bone prey blood prey meat with no taste of speed not at all the flesh of her own kind and she d been tricked again she had barely slowed she kept moving fleeing the site of her kill curving toward safety sliding across the bucking surface of the water where is my enemy where behind her meat thrashed in the water then subsided more prey was climbing the cliff unmolested and that was hardly surprising in the middle of a duel one does not pause to dine how may i lure s prey challenge carlos martinez was shaking with cold with shock and pain from the fractured cheekbone and the flap of scalp torn away when he wrapped himself around bobbi s unconscious body to shield her from the rocks she lay curled on her side flat stomach spasming river water still trickling in a brown stream from her mouth eyes glazed but open and wandering blindly alive vivo flashed insanely into his mind alive vivo scrambling his thoughts she was in shock and probably concussed but all that really mattered for the moment was that she was alive he gripped his head tightly fighting the ringing and the pain in a few moments they quieted and he massaged bobbi s rib cage firmly as he looked about him later in the year when the snow from the northern mountains melted the spot he stood on and another thirty meters of tumbled rock would be submerged in another ninety days there might not he and bobbi might have been dashed against steeply sloping walls of naked rock a few hundred meters north or south the water dashed against sheer cliff as bad and barren as this shelf was it still represented something very near a miracle he would have to fight rapids or climb to get off the beach he managed a quick prayer of thanks that he would nt have to try rescue would come soon thank goodness for the holo links the camp would have seen exactly what happened his head throbbed he kept up the steady gentle massage on bobbi s ribcage her eyes fluttered open weakly carlos what happened we hit a rock that had to be it that was all that it could be so why was there a wet red flag on part of the memory something trying to hide from him and warn him at the same instant carlos ripped his shirt off and wiped her face with it she under her head not long now elliot falkland would be fighting upriver even now he managed a smile to think of the rotund engineer piloting his way through the rapids bobbi would have treatment within the hour and tomorrow they would be able to laugh about this the colony would already be sending out skeeters he thought that he could hear the hum of a distant engine i ll be right back chiquita he said and kissed her softly her lips felt bruised and flushed she reached for him gripped at the wet cloth of his shirt no do nt leave me please there was help out in the river it tore him but he pried her fingers loose shh shh i love you i ll be right back i promise o k shaking unconvinced she nodded her head carlos scrambled over the rocks to the south to a higher point where he could see the the rush of the water silver white with dark patches as it exploded over rocks and took sudden dips and turns to either side the mountain walls were steep at least
should hold our discussion for a bit his voice was very suddenly cautious i snapped off the disk and stuffed the stethoscope in a pocket i started out of the alley toward the back this time walking fairly fast an innocent wanderer who d gotten a little lost maybe with dirty clothing i got to the back of the place the back door opened and people came pouring out maybe others were covering the front i missed but there must have been a lot of people in that place before the first guest of the day arrived or maybe they just got up earlier than i did i ran like a rabbit zig zagging as i went behind the hq was an empty field fine for target practice i found a bush somebody beamed high over my head i snapped off a beam myself maybe they were using paralysis weapons i did nt even carry a slug gun why give anybody nasty ideas and beams come in all sorts i left the bush heading right and then left another beam went by me the end of the field was an empty street i hit it turned and raised my own beamer i never felt sillier in my life for two seconds i was the original sitting duck somebody potted the duck as i went into freeze paralysis for sure and thank you lord i hoped it had nt been the freeze is supposed to be an entirely new state for the human body something that never existed before the paralysis beam i m not about to argue with that and there have been lots of inventions that brought along their own entirely new states anesthesia for one but it feels exactly like being knocked cold you even wake up with a headache this they tell me is due to the distortion effect of the radiative field it is just like the ache you get when you ve been knocked cold except that it has no specific place to be not the back of the head or just over the ear or whatever it aches all over no worse than a bad hangover and i thought i could be courageous about it and open my eyes for one thing i wanted to see what i was fastened to surprise surprise it turned out to be an electric chair i swear the thing looked like one of museum cap over my head little straps holding my arms and legs down the whole works all we needed was a last meal and a chaplain the man looking at me had to be dvorkin carshin he turned out to be the guy in the white clothes and hat the short fat man i d seen arrive earlier he had an expression on his face i did nt like at all he was serenely confident well then he said you have awakened i ve been unfrozen if that s what you mean i said a voice behind me female said awake for one point six seconds before his eyes opened apparently there were several large readout machines back there i could nt turn my head to see hell i could barely wiggle my fingers he is moving one hand the female behind me reported not really precise machines i d only wiggled three i can see that he is awake and moving carshin said what else have you to tell me reaction time exceptionally fast she said the usual lag between waking and opening the eyes is nearly eight seconds sometimes longer these readings do nt become irritated dear girl carshin said i realize the value of your device after all i am its most constant user there was a little silence physical states stable she said high oxygenation exceptionally rapid secondaries in the delta area i d heard for years that if you concentrated hard you could lower your blood pressure change your heartbeat do all sorts of things like that one of the laboratory tricks of the ancients that kept looking as if it were going to turn into something useful though it apparently never had i concentrated on trying to make the machine spell obscene words in the local it could write letters why not carshin looked at me i looked back what is your name he said why he smiled he raised one finger a conductor cueing in a flute my head exploded he was saying that is why sir before it cleared it did clear eventually in about ten years if you put it that way i said gerald knave carshin said and what do you he was interrupted there was a small knot of people away over at my left whom i had nt had time for some i d seen before one of the female twins for instance others had apparently been in the place all along it was the female twin who spoke up i deduced at once that the other one was the girl behind me at the readout boards this one had the same voice in a enough those two i remember to this day as among the really sizable exceptions gerald knave the twin said carshin have you not heard of this man the fat man s eyebrows went up frankly he said never he looked at me again i gave him a shrug as much as i could manage in tight quarters i did nt resent his never page deleted page deleted this time it took a little longer for my head to clear now he was saying do you understand me knave sure i said my voice sounded a little thick which irritated me i ve had worse things happen to me than exploding heads at that moment i could nt think of any very well carshin said an operative of your distinction apparently you have a certain distinction would not have been sent out on a morning perhaps you knew what
the city in a few years i do nt care what that gombeen man fears i m not involved in any of your nonsense so you are not part of any of them the carbine was almost in a position where he might survive the first shot i hate to mention it but i did save you from the hordi supper table last night a fact that seems to have escaped your ladyship s attention that could have been part of the plot she responded stubbornly me girl maybe it is all a plot you re either going to shoot me or not decide for yourself if you think you re going to be able to bring these kids of yours down to hyperion with just the help of a bangedup old noncom and a kid who should be in the classroom you re crazy maybe you do nt want to trust me i do nt care much but you ve got to trust someone i m the only one around who can be of much help now get out of my tent unless you have foul designs on my body in which case welcome i need some sleep he rolled over moderately confident that she would nt shoot o neill her voice came plaintively from the entrance of the tent what now he demanded impatiently got her i am thankful to you for rescuing me from the uh supper table well praise umcile it only took twenty four hours to get it out of your mouth may all those wonderful friends of your god be with this tent well now was nt that nice and so poor retha s on this crazy adventure because she s a dangerous revolutionary i ve seen more dangerous firebrands in the nursery on the iona it was long after dark on the next day when they crossed the line of dunes that separated beach from desert the ocean water looked inviting serene blue topped by great white rolling surf but it was bitter cold so there was no refreshment there o neill contemplated what lay before them it was still a long walk to hyperion all they had to fear was the committee narth the young ones the hooded ones the hordi how many other dangers were there that no one had seen fit to tell him about margie said the commander of the fort was a man of the highest integrity who would have there would be respite there even if they made it they were bound to return to the city o neill yearned for just one small gunship the tom doherty perhaps a speedy and powerful craft to help blast this whole planet into shape deirdre my lady how did you get me into this there s no answer there never is you ve forgotten about me altogether the next morning he was in deeper than ever margie came up to him as they were breaking camp come down to the shore with me she said briskly ah now that s an invitation no man in his right mind would refuse you were truly a major on tara she asked bluntly hmmm he tossed a clump of sand into the surf i mean before you were cashiered or were you lying about that too he had nothing against telling the truth when he could afford it a major and he added irritably i do nt care my bitchy friend whether you believe me or not i do not think i want to ask what a bitch is how old are you let me see twenty five of our years that makes about thirty of your years that makes you five of our years older than i am too much older he demanded oh not at all was that a faint smile but is nt that very young for such a rank customs are different he said shortly but still all right have it your way yes it was very young the thought seemed to be that i was a very good soldier all of which was true enough but it was poet he was meant to be that s beyond a doubt she nodded experienced commander than i am if you rose to such a rank so young a much better one i am going to trust you as you said i have no choice you must be in charge and one more thing major o neill ah musha you ll find me a very democratic co you can call me jimmy tight lipped hands on her hips she ignored his offer of friendship i am technically a widow now even though pojoon was only my intended mate i do not have to seek another i do not intend to do so for a long time perhaps never i will not accept any suggestions in that direction do i make myself clear her pretty face was hard her brown eyes stern what makes you think i d even be interested he demanded she smiled faintly again that s right i m a bitch i presume that in she turned on her heel and strode back toward the ramp well as to that it all depends seamus shouted after her she did not waver ah and the woman does have a lovely ass on her does nt she sure there s a lot better things to do with it than spank it the threat will be enough he then reprimanded himself for having such thoughts about a fellow officer in time of battle the thoughts did not leave him however not at all at all giving him the command changed her attitude later that day she relaxed and smiled and by the second day was joking with the troops making them laugh with him however she was deadly serious that s fine with me woman i want no part of the likes of you wonderful ass and lovely legs and all
i never read in bed said lyra puzzled it was a joke said patience at least smile lyra laughed too loudly but she was obviously his white clothing showed his body to be lithe and strong his face could have been the model for a statue of courage or manhood or virtue when he smiled he seemed to be making love with his eyes and lyra did nt miss any of it except that prekeptor never took his eyes off patience and now she realized what a dangerous game the prince was playing the heptarch s daughter will find that the prophecies of joy in the testament will all be fulfilled in her life said prekeptor patience dutifully translated but also realized now that the prince was saying every word to her the true heptarch s daughter with the meaning doubled the prophecies in the testament no doubt included some of the mumbo jumbo about the seventh seventh seventh daughter he was urging patience to accept the prophecies the prince had still a third gift it was a plastic sheath that fitted over the glass rod within the sheath were constantly shifting flows of brightcolored but was fascinating and beautiful prekeptor handed it to patience the heptarch s daughter will see that it can be worn if she chooses like a crown for all the world to see and admire said the prince it s like the future you can choose any color and follow it wherever it goes if the heptarch s daughter chooses wisely she ll take a path that leads to the restoration of all that was lost subtly in mid speech he had ceased using double meanings now he was clearly speaking only to patience and offering her a restoration to the throne patience could not possibly translate prekeptor s last sentence lyra would insist on an explanation however patience could not leave it out of her translation either or change its meaning because that would alert oruc s listeners that she was conspiring with the prince to conceal his treasonous offer so instead she stood silent what did he say asked said patience to prekeptor she said i m sorry my understanding of tassalik is so poor but i can not understand anything that is said on this subject i beg the prince to converse on matters that this poor interpreter can comprehend i understand he answered smiling his hands were trembling i too feel fear here in the heart of heptagon house what you do not know is that all of our party are trained soldiers and assassins they are prepared to penetrate to the deepest recesses of heptagon house to destroy your enemies anything patience answered could be her death sentence in the first place she herself had been trained as an assassin and she knew that if prekeptor s plan had any chance of working he had just destroyed it by saying it out loud in the open garden no doubt throughout heptagon house all the tassal embassy was now being placed under irresistible arrest with the words of their own prince he would be listened to here in the garden told patience that prekeptor was too great a fool for her to entrust her life to him but there was nothing she could say to stop him and clear herself if she said i have no enemies here in heptagon house she was admitting that he was somehow correct to call her the heptarch s daughter she had to go on pretending that she had no idea of why he was speaking to her and to do that she had to pretend not to understand the plainest spoken tassalik it was nt likely anyone would believe it but it was not necessary to be believed it was necessary merely to make it possible for oruc to pretend to believe it as long as they could both pretend that she did nt know she was the rightful heptarch s daughter she could be allowed to live so she put on her most baffled expression and said i m sorry i guess i m out of my depth i that i do nt what is he saying asked lyra she sounded concerned as well she might be since prekeptor far from coming to marry her had come to kill her father and no doubt her as well i m sorry said patience i understood almost nothing i thought you were fluent so did i mother of kristos whispered prekeptor mother of god why do nt you see the hand of god in my coming i am the angel that stands at the door and knocks i announce to you god will fill your womb his words were frightening enough but the fervency with which he said them was terrifying what role did he have in mind for her in his religion mother of god that was the ancient virgin from earth and yet he called her that as if it were her name still she showed vaguely puzzled look on her face holy mother do nt you see how kristos has prepared the path for his coming he took a step toward her immediately she hardened her expression and he stopped retreated two steps no matter what you think god is irresistible he said he has devoted seven times seven times seven generations to create you to be the fit mother of the incarnation of kristos on the planet imakulata this is greater than the number of generations down to the time of the virgin of earth she let the helpless puzzled look return to her face even as she tried to plan a course of action in a way this was just like one of angel s favorite games he would give her a complex mathematical problem orally so she had no written guide to help her concentrate and then immediately launch into a complex story five minutes or ten minutes or
insurance unless you inform the police that s a point fred ingelnook said true shirley said but it s still minor in relation to the public relations problem for now we will not report it but we ll check with insurance and hear from the department chiefs sounds good to me fred ingelnook said fine bob walthrow said the conversation wound down and shirley sent the two executives home she held jason her at eight o clock that morning i ve asked helene to come in early maybe we can make some sense out of what s going on jason nodded still wondering why shirley could nt have told him all this on the phone but he was too tired to care and after giving her a brief kiss on the cheek he staggered back out to his car hoping for two or three hours sleep pit was just after eight that saturday morning when jason bleary eyed entered shirley s office it was paneled in dark mahogany with dark green carpet and brass fixtures and looked more like it belonged to a banker than to the chief executive of a health care plan shirley was on the phone talking to an insurance adjuster so jason sat and waited after she hung up she said you were right about the insurance they have no intention of paying a claim unless the break in is reported then report it first s missing they crossed into the outpatient building and took the elevator up to the sixth floor a security guard was waiting for them and unlocked the inner door they dispensed with the booties and white coat like hayes s apartment the lab was a mess all the drawers and cabinets had been emptied onto the floor but the high tech equipment appeared untouched so it was obvious to both of them that it had been a search and not a destructive visit jason glanced into hayes s office it was equally littered with the contents of the desk and several file cabinets strewn about the floor helene brennquivist appeared in the doorway to the animal room her face white and drawn her hair was again severely pulled back from her face but without her usual shapeless lab coat jason could see she had an attractive figure can you tell if anything is missing shirley asked well i do nt see my data books helene said but the worst is what s happened to the animals what about them jason asked noting that her usually emotionless face was trembling with fear maybe you should look they ve all been killed jason stepped around helene and through the steel door into the animal area he was immediately confronted with a pungent zoolike stench he turned on the light it was a larger room some fifty feet long and thirty feet wide the animal cages were organized in rows and stacked one on top of the other sometimes as many as six high jason started down the nearest row glancing into individual cages behind him the door closed with a decisive click helene had not been exaggerating all the animals that jason saw were dead hideously curled in contorted positions often with bloodied tongues as if they d chewed them in their final agony suddenly jason stopped short staring into a group of large cages he saw something that made his never seen they were huge almost the size of pigs and their bald whiplike tails were as thick as jason s wrists their exposed teeth were four inches long moving along jason came to rabbits the same size and then white mice the size of small dogs this side of genetic engineering horrified jason although he was afraid of what he might see morbid curiosity drove him on slowly he looked into other cages seeing distortions of familiar creatures that made him sick it was science gone mad rabbits with several heads and mice with supernumerary extremities and extra sets of eyes for jason genetic manipulation of primitive bacteria was one thing distortion of mammals was quite another he retreated back to the central part of the lab where shirley and helene had been checking the scintillation cultures have you seen the animals jason asked shirley with disgust unfortunately when curran was here do nt remind me no shirley said we never questioned hayes we never thought we had to the power of celebrity jason said cynically the animals were part of dr hayes s growth hormone work helene said defensively whatever jason said he was not interested in any ethical argumentwith helene at the moment at any rate they re all dead all of them shirley questioned how bizarre what do you think happened poison jason said grimly though why anyone searching for drugs would bother to kill lab animals beats me do you have any explanation for all of this shirley said angrily turning to helene the younger woman shook her head her eyes darting nervously about the room shirley continued to stare at helene who was now shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot jason watched intrigued by shirley s suddenly aggressive behavior you or you re going to be in a lot of trouble dr howard is convinced you re keeping something from us if that s true and we find out i hope you realize what that can do to your career helene s anxiety was finally apparent i just followed dr hayes s orders she said her voice breaking what orders shirley asked lowering her voice threateningly we did some free lance work here what kind dr hayes moonlighted for a company called gene inc we developed a recombinant strain of e coli to produce a hormone for them were you aware that moonlighting was specifically forbidden under dr hayes s contract that s what he told me helene admitted shirley glared at helene for another minute finally she said i do nt want you to speak
close enough not to matter in this case she had photographs of actual government documents she placed the developed film in a small projector and focused the frame on the white paint of her bedroom wall bisyarina her current assignment and knew a little about how to evaluate what she d just received she was sure it would make her seniors happy the next morning she made her drop and the photographs traveledacross the border into mexico on a tractor trailer rig belonging to a long haul concern based in austin it was delivering oil drilling machinery by the end of the day the photos would be in the soviet embassy in mexico city the day after that in cuba where they would be placed on an aeroflot flight direct to moscow catalystso colonel what is your assessment filitov asked comrade bright star may be the most important program in the soviet union bondarenko said with conviction he handed over forty handwritten pages here is the first draft of my report i did that on the airplane i ll have a proper copy typed today but i thought that you d you thought correctly i understand that they ran a test test and i was allowed to inspect much of the equipment both before and after i was profoundly impressed with the installation and the people who run it if i may be permitted general pokryshkin is an outstanding officer and the perfect man for that post he is decidedly not a careerist but rather a progressive officer of the finest type to manage the academics on that hilltop is no easy task misha grunted agreement i know about academicians are you telling me he has them organized like a military unit no comrade colonel but pokryshkin has learned how to keep them relatively happy and productive at the same time there is a sense of a sense of mission at bright star that one rarely encounters even in the officer corps i do not say this lightly mikhail semyonovich i was most impressed by all aspects of the operation tom clancy perhaps it is the same at the space facilities i have heard such draw the comparison and the systems themselves bright star is not yet a weapon there are still technical diffi culties pokryshkin identified and explained them at length to me for the moment this is still nothing more than an experimental program but the most important breakthroughs have been made in several years it will be a weapon of enormous potential what of its cost misha asked that drew a shrug impossible to estimate it will be costly but the expensive part of the program the research and development phase is largely com pleted the actual production and engineering costs should be less than one might expect for the weapon itself that is i can not eval uate the costs of the support equipment the radars and surveillance satellites that was not part of my brief in any case besides like soldiers all over the world he thought in terms of mission not cost be a problem but a manageable one the individual lasers are complex and difficult to maintain on the other hand by building more than the site actually needs we could easily cycle them through a regular maintenance program and always have the nec essary number on line in fact this is the method proposed by the chief project engineer so they ve solved the power output problem then my draft report describes that in rough terms my final paper will be more specific misha allowed himself a smile so that even i can understand it comrade colonel bondarenko replied seriously i know that you have a better understanding of technical matters than you care to admit the important aspects of the power breakthrough are actually quite simple in theory that is the precise engineering details are rather complex but can easily be deduced from the redesign of the lasing cavity as with the first atomic bomb once the excellent you can finish your report by tomorrow yes comrade colonel misha stood bondarenko did the same i will read over your preliminary report this afternoon get me the complete report to morrow and i will digest it over the weekend next week we will brief the minister allah s ways were surely mysterious the archer thought as much as he d wanted to kill a soviet transport aircraft all he had to do was return to his home the river town of ghazni it had been only a week since he d left pakistan a local storm had grounded russian aircraft for the past several days allowing him to make good time he arrived with his fresh supplies of missiles and found his chieftain planning an attack on the town s outlying airport the winter weather was hard on everyone and the infidels left the outer security posts to afghan soldiers in the service of the traitorous government in kabul what they commanding the battalion on perimeter duty worked for the local mudjaheddin the perimeter would be open when the time came allowing three hundred guerrillas to attack straight into the soviet camp it would be a major assault the freedom fighters were organized into three companies of one hundred men each all three were committed to the attack the chieftain understood the utility of a tactical reserve but had too much front to cover with too few men it was a risk but he and his men had been running risks since what did one more matter as usual the chieftain would be in the place of greatest danger and the archer would be nearby they were heading for the airfield

i ve given you all this preliminary stuff instead of just dictating from the newsclips the photos when they came made things a little better because their postures were so versatile and graceful and their basically radial bodies were obviously in transition to a bilaterally symmetrical form the four back leg tentacles were much larger fact if as happened later a small one wore a long robe with a hood to conceal the shiny bald dome above the eye it could pass for a large somewhat top heavy human form and they spent much of their time thus upright looking rather like multiply armed indian deities and smelling delightful so that as soon as earth saw more of them the original sci fi horror images were seen to be ludicrously inappropriate and forgotten while todd and jim were taking in the nature of their audience and vice versa their new friends were folding back the walls of their compartments and dragging the cushions to the edge of the front we speak one to all like this we show you and they motioned todd and jim to take seats no fear fall off everybody catch then they stationed themselves on each side laid their transmission tentacles across jim and todd s shoulders and seemed to listen no clothes too thick so the men first gingerly lifted off their helmets getting a real blast of carnation scent and then started peeling down they felt a bit odd about it in front of all those eager eyes but what the hell their bodies were no more to the aliens than a wombat s to them so they sat back down again nude and the tentacles came back ahhh good and with that the two big aliens stretched their other transmitter arms out to the aliens in the compartments next door and these did the same to those around them so that in a minute the whole great amphitheatre was intricately laced together with the men as foci while this was happening todd felt a plucking at his shins he looked down and there was this dark blue tentacle coming up at him from the compartment below he heard or sensed what could only be a giggle and next instant three big round bright eyes were staring up at fume of interest wafted up the alien next to him emitted a reproving sound and batted at the eyes with a spare limb young ones peering down todd and jim saw a cluster of smaller aliens in the chamber below evidently trying to get in on the network by short circuit it s okay he grinned no problem to us so their two big friends let the little fellows sneak tendrils in to touch the men s legs and feet okay you go first said the one next to jim oh wait us name angli an gli it repeated aloud you name hello angli said jim to them both us name hu mans but he pointed at the other you have special personal name for you only well that was their introduction to the one great difficulty of mind speech asking questions it took and even so they were nt sure they had it right jim said the customary thing here seems to be to call up a quick flash image of the person or his eye or something special about him or her i do nt think verbal names are used much but our friends seem to be something like urizel and azazel for what it s worth we ll try calling them that and see if it works then he put his arm around todd we together hu mans he said but he alone gesturing is todd i me here am jim todd jim jim todd get it me jane you tarzan muttered todd shut up you idiot this is no time to clown we ll have to be sure somehow that they know what a joke is all right urizel what do you want to know about us humans first and so started the greatest show and tell anthropology class of their lives surprisingly soon it got itself organized with their two friends alternately passing questions to the men not surprisingly in view of their tv fare the first queries were mainly about economics todd had the pleasure of trying to answer what is money he managed to form a picture of a medium of exchange passing from hand to hand in the human world and luckily the angli seemed to have something to relate this to jim got a visual image of furry brown creatures carrying on their tails stacks of big square things with holes in them that had to be clumsy coins gosh what does a really rich one do todd did nt expect an answer but the angli had picked up the drift of his query and he got a clear mental picture of a pompous looking brown alien followed by a formal train of specialized coin bearers with big discs both humans and angli laughed what do you do with money azazel asked jim gulped and tried to visualize a bank teller vaults checkbooks i fear i m not doing justice to the international banking system he said to todd but dammit ours has to make more sense than carrying your money around on your tail i m beginning to wonder todd muttered no no he said to azazel not important it was now very apparent that the humans were by no means the first new race the angli had met fleeting images of many other aliens worlds cities ships crossed their perceptions from various angli minds these aliens seemed to have spent years jaunting about the galaxy meeting people and things as to the angli s own home world the notion that they were martians was disposed of very early they were shown an image of a go type sun a view of the nearby constellations
tell you too but forebore speaking for the same reason joan quickly recounted her tour of the castle her confrontation with conroy and her suspicion that he was up to no good not content to give over her opinion that someone had been concealedpin the white keep earlier that day she ventured to say that it was conroy a very sneaky sort she said but why should he have been lurking within matthew asked god knows she be above him he s full of resentment because i ordered him from the house to the stables perhaps he wanted to give two silly women a fright although he seems to be friends with una and she was as unnerved as i if not more so he may be trying to scare us off matthew suggested making capital of the old stories about the black keep perhaps he s heard about aileen mogaill perhaps he killed her himself perhaps she found him prowling and he took her head for the cause oh a goodly cause for homicide joan said but joan left behind the irishman s behavior to proceed to greater news not in the order in which the event occurred but in order of its importance in her mind she told him what she had seen in the woods matthew had no trouble identifying una s hawk faced lover as stafford s manservant wylkin there can be no two faces so alike give him no satisfaction beyond the assurance it was english spoken rather than some other tongue of that she was sure so una understands english after all matthew said shaking his head in wonderment that s a new fact to be reckoned with she made fools of us joan said bitterly moll too for surely the horrid woman knew all along it was she who told us una could not speak what must we have uttered in her presence then matthew said shaking his head pinching his chin with thumb and forefinger but she had already considered that she was positive they had not spoken of their secret mission except in privacy as now perhaps the cook s deception had failed of its intent then at least we ve been warned henceforth forearmed against una and moll said matthew but did wylkin see you in the woods there s the joan said hurt a little at the suggestion she should be so maladroit a spy a naked savage stealing on his prey could not have been more circumspect i crouched down low in the ferns and thorns on my haunches wylkin saw nothing and una passed by unawares and singing upon her return to the house i waited then until i was sure both were gone completely thank god matthew said had wylkin seen you crouched there who knows what he would have done edward speaks very ill of him then she told him about her visit to the lake she had saved this for last for she regarded both her glimmering and the chest that had provoked it the first of their clues to sir john s drowning matthew listened to her story without interrupting when she had finished he put a sympathetic hand on her hand and said a terrible vision indeed then he wanted to know all about the its quality and all the details of its construction that joan had only half noticed what she exclaimed in exasperation am i a carpenter that i should observe these things it was a chest a plain wooden chest such as might store clothing well it might be a clue matthew conceded but she protested his weaseling might be of course it s a clue anyone can see that in the first place it was no chest for casual discarding who but a fool would throw away a chest so fine in the second it was not hidden where i found it but half submerged an incompetent concealment if there ever was one i ll wager it floated ashore and foundered like a vessel at low tide only it was deep in the sedge very deep seeing it was a stroke of luck but oh matthew such a midnight melancholy seized me when i touched the thing and a vision all about me and loathsome creatures gaping and sucking she shuddered at the recollection and seeing how distressed she was matthew put his arm around her shoulders and drew her forehead against his cheek her skin was cool he could feel her trembling he asked her what she thought her vision meant and she shook her head puzzled she was almost afraid to speculate but she saidpshe was sure the chest meant something was connected to the baronet s death and perhaps with aileen mogaill s too her certainty seemed to settle the matter and matthew admitted the empty chest into his inventory of clues as small an inventory as it was he had too much respect for his wife s intuitions and visions to contest her interpretation partly to distract her from her gloomy memories he told her about his visit to the wretched tenant farms about his meeting with stafford and wylkin repeating all that was on either side as best he could recall it he told at the bastian cottage and about the fire that had been laid shortly before his arrival but not by the old man who matthew was convinced would have been incapable of it joan agreed it was very suspicious a child in the cottage whose existence edward denies could it have been a mewing cat you heard or a squealing pig the bastians keep no pigs and i saw no cat he said at the same time thinking that one often saw no cat yet there might have been one yet he insisted he knew what he had heard the wail of a human child a singular isolated note he could have discerned in the mighty cacophony of a tempest
from the slime and blood managed to get the body over his shoulder his knees began topbuckle but not now you fucking knees not when i fucking need you the blood and rain were blinding him and he worked by the sense of touch he closed the trunk and there was a moment of panic when he thought maybe he d locked the car keys in the trunk he fumbled around in his pockets balancing the dead man on his shoulders while he checked it out the relief when he found the keys almost made him drop the body then he began the climb up onto the trunk slowly so you do nt drop the bastard carefully so you do nt slip make sure of the grip like you re on the icy lip of some crevice of the matterhorn ah god god god he could feel the body sliding away again the momentum was irresistible he felt like crying when the body slithered off under the buick he could hear the head crack against the pavement it made him cringe it did nt did maybe it was worse there was something profane about injuring a dead man fuck fuck fuck he thought of stopping just giving up he was innocent of wrongdoing he could just accept the incriminating accusations admit the moment of temptation and get it all out in the open but he could nt surrender a lifelong habit of rectitude he could nt admit the foolish impulse that had brought him here in the first place no despite the pain in his chest jack began again heaving and cursing and swearing in the cold rain he summoned reserves of strength that he did nt know he had and began the maneuvering and lifting first up against the car then bending under the bulk like a fireman letting his legs do the lifting he was learning he made no mistakes working carefully systematically he got himself and the body up to the rim of the dumpster at last using his head to bull it that final inch on that high perch with his burden in his arms he looked up and found himself staring smack into the face of the dead man i ll have nightmares from this he told the dead man if it s any comfort i ll probably never sleep peacefully again as he tried to catch his breath he tried to imagine how the sight of him and his dead body would strike the cops in a passing sector car a station house legend would be born then then you re not gon na believe this it turns out to be an ex fucking cop trying to lose a stiff jack mann might become a locker room immortal having recovered a little jack noticed that the lid of the dumpster was closed schmuck why did nt you leave it open he turned to open it and twisted his back i ll feel that later too he told himself then he rolled the corpse into the hole as the body sank into its grave god forgive me he mumbled then he reached over and piled debris over the dead man he did nt want anyone peeking in and finding it tomorrow with any luck the corpse would be gone forever trucked out to some rockaway landfill along with all the other nameless mob victims buried in that unmarked cemetery his work was finished and he climbed down and stood on the asphalt he was winded and wheezing his muscles were singing from the exertion he stood for a moment dazed by what he had done then he fished out the car keys opened the trunk and found a towel and wiped away the blood he turned his face upward and blessed the rain as he struggled back into his shirt and jacket he looked at the bag full of money the plan had been to toss the money and the gun into the dumpster along with the body one convenient burial it would be as maybe he should get rid of the money and the gun someplace else he needed time he stuffed the bag full of cash deeper into the trunk covered it with his own debris climbed into the driver s seat and headed home he was too tired and it was nt only rain running down his cheeks there were also tears she was cold and wet although it was nt the winter weather that made her shiver waiting for the bus on the little spit of land between the airport and the mainland of queens it was much worse on an inclement night in belfast what nora felt through her coat was the raw wind of michael back in her life this is america she told herself i do nt have to be stuck with my old sad story when the bus finally pulled up to the shelter outside of the she been on cross bay boulevard the faces of the other two passengers did nt help nora s morale the first was a middle aged woman a rosary she had the look of permanent fear stitched in her face and stared fiercely out of the window a charwoman thought nora from the look of her gnarled hands and wild hairpand haggard face you saw them like that in ireland nora thought young hags on their way to becoming old hags halfway up the aisle was a man in rough work clothes he bobbed like a puppet with the movement of the bus there were specks of vomit on his beard nora could guess his story out drinking after a day s work and coming home surly and mean to his wife from high school and a batch of neglected kids then she saw herself in the reflection of the bus window her wet hair flat against her head we look like outpatients from an asylum nora thought glancing at the pale laborer and the
the middle of the advancing wave by the task of stripping the offensive armor off the old man foil and skin ripped red seeping from broad patches of raw skin axxter felt bad about that it was nt the old man s fault much less so than his own the old guy had been a pawn used to spear another pawn he d wind up spending a lot of time in the mass hospital getting new armor grafted on not that there would be any remedy for his senile broken heart real time he toppled back in his chair as the edge of the table slammed into his stomach the table itself rose turning on its long axis as the front of the mob surged against it axxter knocked breathless looked up in time to see the table come crashing down on him or almost the top edge caught against the tent fabric behind him forming a triangular space with the platform underneath axxter uncurled from his knees drawn up egg unlacing his fingers from the top of his head he could hear the outraged havoc mass warriors foaming and scrabbling at the underside of the table as though their black fingernails could scrape right through to him jesus christ fucking shit the lofty time dilated perspective snapped away from him on hands and knees he listened to the shouts coming from the other side of the capsized table the sonsabitches were going to kill him if i m lucky once they got their hands on him they had all sorts of ingenious ways to flesh and nervous system and that prickly emotion had been revved flat out inside their breasts being made mock of like that in front of the ambassadors and hangers on from all their allied tribes p and by some little outside freelancer punk like him they all had major payback to deal out the table shivered with the blows raining against it the angle between it the platform and the tent wall formed a narrow tunnel none of the crazed mob had thought yet of going around to either end crawling in and pulling him out there were probably only a few more seconds before the crowd backed up enough to let the table be pulled away exposing him one chance the thought of all those whirling through axxter s head stood out of saving his life or at least enough little spark of it to get through the beating plus that was going to come crashing down on him if he could scoot down the triangular tunnel pop out make a dash up to the dignitaries table get there before any of the mob spotted him and collared him with a hairy forearm around his neck throw his arms around general cripplemaker s knees then he could make a chattel declaration to the tribe and then he d be under their protection or at least a little bit enough they could nt kill him by the usual rules though he knew they d come as close as they could the plan and the consequences of becoming an owned thing no longer human an object zipped through his mind without words he looked down the tunnel he had a clear shot to the dais everyone on the floor seemed to have come around to join in the assault on the overturned table what looked like the bottom half of cripplemaker s dress uniform shining black trouser legs striped with red appeared in the distance a chair knocked over behind the standing figure go he started broken glass just go for christ s sake p uhff the muffled sound of blows came through the table get back ya asshole somebody out there was finally taking charge come on move it back goddam mit axxter froze staring down to the triangular opening ahead of him and beyond he did nt see the chaos of tables and chairs and the general s legs something else like looking down the wall at night into dark without bottom get back get back come on come on move it the commanding voice barked and the table creaked in response relieved of the weight pressed against it the narrow tunnel lengthened and spiraled as axxter gazed down into its depths fingers appeared around the edge of the table ya got it no over there come on get outta the way okay pull the table crashed over its climbed on top of a chair on the dais to get a better view of the operations the little graffex bastard was going to pay he d make sure of that for making a fool out of him well the general shouted down to the men swarming over the table you got him the sergeant who d been directing the operation pulled a pair of men back by their shoulders down the length of the upside down table the rest stood back where is he the sergeant looked to either side and got shrugs and upraised palms in reply where d he go a couple of the havoc mass warriors pried the edge of the table up from the platform as though the graffex might have been squashed flat underneath the baffled sergeant looked up at the general axxter could hear them swearing and stomping around through the platform he swayed in open air the p big step down grip on the ropes slung beneath the ceremonial tent he d have to move fast now or his one slick move would have been in vain a glance down to the cloud barrier far below brought his stomach up in his throat he gripped the rope tighter his ankles locked around its length farther along and started inching himself toward the wall in the expanded seconds just before the mass warriors had pulled the table back over he d had a vision a peek down the line into the future his future after he d made his chattel declaration
pass about ten minutes later they reached the clay mounds and the square wells with their terrible contents they drove through thick loose mud for a long time then came to the tracks that their own tires had made going the other way and followed them back to the valley throwing up fountains of mud from beneath its wheels the jeep picked its way between the clay mounds a blurred light flared up in the darkness and came toward them growing larger until they could distinguish three separate lights but the captain maintained speed knowing it was a reflection the doubler began to show signs of uneasiness it moved it grunted it even shifted its weight dangerously making the jeep tilt more to the left the doctor tried to calm the creature with his voice though without much success glancing back he saw that it now resembled a rounded sugarloaf on top the doubler had pulled in its small torso and when the momentary ripple of heat and the disappearance of their reflection announced that they had crossed the mysterious line that the huge passenger relaxed stopped fidgeting and even seemed to enjoy the night ride the jeep was now climbing a steep slope it pitched and reeled as its bulging tires lumbered over large rocks the engine straining whined once or twice they began rolling backward the wheels spinning in a spray of loose soil the captain turned the steering wheel sharply and they stopped cautiously he turned the jeep around and they went back down the slope along a diagonal into the valley where are we going asked the chemist nervously gusts of night air carried tiny droplets of water almost like rain we ll try somewhere else said the captain they halted and looked uphill using one of the headlights but there was not much to see so they tried again at random the slope soon became the ground was dry and the jeep could proceed every time the captain steered to keep to compass north however the jeep fell back on its rear tires forcing him westward which meant that they would run into the thicket as far as he could remember the thicket covered most of the edge of the plateau toward which they were climbing but there was nothing to be done the headlights struck a row of white figures swaying in the gloom no it was only mist drops of condensation formed and ran down the windshield and the metal tubing of the seat frames the cold mist thickened then thinned and they had no idea where they were going the captain tried only to go uphill suddenly the mist dispersed and the headlights now bright revealed the top of the slope the black sky above was filled with stars everyone began to feel better how s our passenger asked the captain not turning around said the doctor the slope became steeper and the jeep s center of gravity shifting to the rear made it impossible to steer with the front wheels they skidded several feet to the side then the doctor suggested maybe i should sit up front between the headlights on the bumper not yet the captain said he released air from the tires and the jeep sinking held the ground better they crossed a large loamy area and the ragged line of scrub above them came closer and closer like an over hanging black brush going through it was out of the question but they could nt turn to look for a better place to enter so they continued upward and came to an abrupt halt about forty feet from a wall six feet high the headlights showed yellow clay filled with threadlike roots the chemist cursed the captain got out took a shovel and dug at the clay digging he moved higher the chemist hurried after him the doctor could hear them working their way into the thicket could hear the snap and crackle of dry branches the captain s flashlight flickered went out went on again in another place what awful stuff growled the chemist this is risky we are hardly strangers to risk responded the captain raising his voice he called to the doctor we re going to start a little landslide it should clear a path for us try to keep our passenger from getting frightened all right the doctor shouted back he turned around in his seat to face the doubler who was curled up and still then came the sound of moving clay and a stream of clods rolled down the slope lumps thudded against the jeep the landslide stopped though bits of soil kept trickling from the wall the doctor checked the creature it was now a wide funnel shaped breach in the overhanging lip of clay the captain was standing in it working energetically with his shovel it was past twelve by the time they took the towline the reel and the grappling hook from the luggage carrier fastened one end of the line to the jeep and pulled the other through the breach and up into the thicket where it was anchored the doctor and the chemist got out and the captain turned on all the wheel motors and the front winch which drew the vehicle forward bit by bit further widening of the passage was required but half an hour later the jeep was on the plateau plowing noisily through the dry and brittle thicket for another hour their progress was very slow only when the vegetation came to an end were they able to pick up speed halfway the chemist shouted to the doctor after looking over the captain s shoulder at the odometer the captain did nt think been forced to take on the slope he was bent forward his face close to the windshield his eyes on the terrain he was trying to avoid the larger boulders and ruts and take the smaller ones between the wheels
momma once told me that she and daddy named me dawn because i was born at the break of day that was the first of a thousand lies momma and daddy would tell me and my brother jimmy of course we would nt know they were lies not for a long time not until the day they came to take us away chapter another new place the sound of dresser drawers being opened and closed woke me i heard momma and daddy whispering in their room and my heart began to thump fast and hard i pressed my palm against my chest took a deep breath and turned to wake jimmy but he was already sitting up in our sofa bed bathed in the silvery moonlight that came pouring through our bare window my sixteen year old brother s face looked chiseled from granite he sat there so still listening i lay there listening with him listening to the hateful wind whistle through the cracks and crannies of this small small rundown town just outside of washington d c we had been here barely four months what is it jimmy what s going on i asked shivering partly from the cold and partly because deep inside i knew the answer jimmy fell back against his pillow and then brought his hands behind his head in a sulk he stared up at the dark ceiling the pace of momma s and daddy s movements became more frenzied we were gon na get a puppy here jimmy mumbled and this spring momma and i were gon na plant a garden and grow our own vegetables i could feel his frustration and anger like heat from an iron radiator what happened i asked mournfully for i too had high hopes daddy came home later than usual he said a prophetic note of doom in his voice he rushed in here his eyes wild you know bright and there and not long after they started packing might as well get up and get dressed jimmy said throwing the blanket off him and turning to sit up they ll be out here shortly tellin us to do it anyway i groaned not again and not again in the middle of the night jimmy leaned over to turn on the lamp by our pull out bed and started to put on his socks so he would nt have to step down on a cold floor he was so depressed he did nt even worry about getting dressed in front of me i fell back and watched him unfold his pants so he could slip into them moving with a quiet resignation that made everything around me seem more like a dream how i wished it were i was fourteen years old and for as long as i could remember we had been packing and unpacking going from one place to another it always seemed that just when my a new school and finally made some friends and i got to know my teachers we had to leave maybe we really were no better than homeless gypsies like jimmy always said wanderers poorer than the poorest for even the poorest families had some place they could call home some place they could return to when things went bad a place where they had grandmas and grandpas or uncles and aunts to hug them and comfort them and make them feel good again we would have settled even for cousins at least i would have i peeled back the blanket and my nightgown fell away and exposed most of my bosom i glanced at jimmy and caught him gazing at me in the moonlight he shifted his eyes away quickly embarrassment made my heart pitterpatter and i pressed my palm against the bodice of my nightgown i had never told any of my girlfriends at school that jimmy and i shared even a room together much less this dilapidated pull out bed i react embarrassing both jimmy and me even more i brought my feet down on the freezing cold bare wood floor my teeth chattering i embraced myself and hurried across the small room to gather up a blouse and a sweater and a pair of jeans then i went into the bathroom to dress by the time i finished jimmy had his suitcase closed it seemed we always left something else behind each time there was only so much room in daddy s old car anyway i folded my nightgown and put it neatly into my own suitcase the clasps were as hard as ever to close and jimmy had to help momma and daddy s bedroom door opened and they came out their suitcases in hand too we stood there facing them holding our own why do we have to leave in the middle of the night again i asked looking at daddy and wondering if leaving would make him angry as it so often did best time to with a quick order not to ask too many questions jimmy was right daddy had that wild look again a look that seemed so unnatural it sent shivers up and down my spine i hated it when daddy got that look he was a handsome man with rugged features a cap of sleek brown hair and dark coal eyes when the day came that i fell in love and decided to marry i hoped my husband would be just as handsome as daddy but i hated it when daddy was displeased when he got that wild look it marred his handsome features and made him ugly something i could nt bear to see jimmy take the suitcases down dawn you help your momma pack up whatever she wants from the kitchen i glanced at jimmy he was only two years older than i was but there was a wider gap in our looks he was tall and lean and muscular like daddy i was small with
chapter one lt whitneyville idaho territory april the keening whine of the train whistle deepened emma chalmers despair at the ending of anna karenina and she sniffled as she slammed the book closed she then hastily dried her eyes with a wadded handkerchief trimmed in blue tatting and smoothed the skirts of her prim brown sateen dress grabbing up a new supply of posters she d just had printed over at the newspaper office emma dashed for the door the whitneyville lending library was empty and she did nt bother to lock up since no one she knew would have stooped so low as to steal a book and she d collected only two cents in fines she saw a slim figure reflected back to her as she passed the spotless windows of the general store emma quickened her steps as it had been her experience that some of the conductors and stagecoach drivers would evade her if given the opportunity as she passed the yellow belly saloon with its peeling sawdust and beer and sweat came out to wrap themselves around her like an insidious vine emma broke into a ladylike sprint clutching her posters to her shapely bosom with one hand and keeping her skirts out of the dirt and tobacco juice on the sidewalk with the other her bright hair pulled into a single thick plait swung as she ran the railroad yard was crowded with arriving and departing passengers most were human but there were some pigs and horses and an occasional crate of squawking chickens emma picked her way through the throng as daintily as she could and with a practiced eye sought out the conductor a well fed man with a ruddy complexion and thick white hair he was half hidden behind a shipment of canned meats bound for the general store after clearing her throat a sound barely discernible in the din emma approached good afternoon mr lathrop she said politely miss emma mr lathrop answered with a nod of his bushy head i m afraid there s no news today it just seems like nobody in this whole part of the country knows anything about your sisters even though she d expected this answer after all she d gotten virtually the same one every week for nearly thirteen years emma was stricken for a moment with the purest of sorrow if if you would just pass these bills out as you go along mr lathrop accepted the stack of crisply printed placards and held one up with great ceremony for his pensive perusal it read reward cash for any information leading to the location of miss caroline chalmers dark of hair and eyes or miss lily chalmers fair and having brown eyes please contact miss emma chalmers in care of the whitneyville lending library whitneyville idaho territory perhaps i should have said thank you emma fretted bending around mr lathrop s ample shoulder to read the bold print plain enough that you d be grateful for any help miss emma she sighed sometimes it just seems hopeless sort of like the ending of anna karenina have you read that book mr lathrop he looked bewildered not so as i remember miss emma a man does nt get much chance to read when he spends his days on the rails emma nodded soberly as she handed over the rest of the posters i suppose not the noise would be powerfully distracting i should think it was mr lathrop s solemn duty to see that pigs and people found their proper places aboard the train therefore he left emma her posters in his arms after favoring her with a little tip of his hat every christmas emma remembered him with a pair of knitted socks and a box of walnut fudge and she wondered now if that was proper recompense for a man who had tried so steadfastly to be helpful and departing passengers for she d never stopped hoping to find one of her sisters among them walking alongside the track she nearly collided with a ramp extending from one of the boxcars not to mention the man and horse coming down that ramp emma gave a startled gasp and leaped backwards while the man smiled at her from the saddle and touched the brim of his battered hat he looked like a seedy saddlebum with no gentle qualities to recommend him and yet emma felt a not unpleasant tug in the pit of her stomach as she returned his regard you ought to look where you re going she said crisply controlling his mount with barely perceptible movements of his gloved hands the stranger urged the nervous horse into the dirt and cinders at the side of the tracks apparently he found the fact that emma had taken umbrage very amusing because he was still grinning his teeth wickedly white against a sun browned beard stubbled face he gave a mocking ladyship he said then he let out a low hoot of laughter and rode off emma smoothed her hair then sighed as she lifted her skirts and started back the way she d come it seemed to her that no one bothered to cultivate good manners any longer because something about the man on the horse had disturbed her emma forcibly shifted her mind to the search for her sisters even if she came face to face with lily or caroline she thought in despair she might not recognize them people could change so much in thirteen years they would be grown women now emma did not come out of her reverie until she was passing the first territorial bank through the window she spotted fulton whitney who made no secret of the fact that he aspired to be her husband he was tall and blond and he looked very handsome in his gray pin striped trousers with a vest over his white linen shirt and there was a gentlemanly garter

get up and call him and tell him she needed help he d come home and together they d figure out what to do professional help maybe or something just as simple as signing up for a course in something unusual at the university or dinner out and a movie like out of date alka seltzer in standing water whatever became of delia oh her shelf life expired such an unshame she closed her eyes and pretended to sleep sometime later she pretended to visualize the view from the window overlooking the bus stop the boys capered in the wet and the dark one less than they had been however many there were and she knew they were aware she was watching they d been aware all along and they d been holding her their aimless movements actually an arcane little raindance meant to mesmerize as it wove a pattern that worked only on someone who had receded far enough so far that joe shook her arm once and then twice so she pretended to wake up it s the weather joe said they say it s a cycle of tropical storms affecting the northern latitudes happens every few years everyone s walking around with their eyes glazed and their mouths hanging open but it ought feel like a new person trust me she did trust him delia thought her unlife was completely in his hands or had been until it had started slipping through his fingers what would happen when he discovered she was a failed human being or rather what would unhappen she got up from the easy chair and went to the window peering through the dribbles of rain all right joe said after a long pause have it your way do nt do anything do nt be anything i saw you had that book out you did nt read it though did you pat cadigan hi v no she said in a small voice the boys were showily keeping their hacks to her she could tell by the way their silhouettes bent and dipped against the faint shine of the wet pavement all right he said again there s nothing i can do for you deals no one can pull you out of this until you reach out i ve thrown you a rope several times but you ve refused to grab onto it the boys made a momentary tableau around the bench like a dance troupe pausing at a rest in the music lightning strobed silently their face were turned upward to the window now and she caught a glimpse of the rain beaded on their colorless cheeks it s not refusal joe it s paralysis he did nt answer it took her a long time to turn around and see that he had absurdly fallen asleep his ever present book tented over his crotch delia pressed her hands against her mouth locked out she could nt get back in now if she tried with all her strength the rain made white noise against the windows on the street no she straightened up throwing off the afghan she d wrapped around her shoulders no she would not accept state of un she would fight her way back in if it meant she had to die in the attempt but she would die real yo melodrama that s right you wan na make something of it she went to the closet by the front door and yanked out the first coat she touched an old army surplus jacket of joe s that they d been hanging onto for no reason except inertia well the age of inertia was over she thought as she thrust herself into it she d use it and anything else she d use everything usable and anything unusable would go out in the trash she paused in the half open door and looked back at joe his breathing was heavy but soft not quite a snore then she stomped out afire with resolve she marched down seven flights of stairs rather than waiting for the elevator strode through the empty lobby and pushed stiffarmed out the security door the rain in ultimate anti climax had catching her breath they only came out in the rain they were gone now and just what had she thought she was going to accomplish anyway confront them and do what order them off her turf and forbid them ever to return to steal her soul they were just a bunch of boys in the goddamn rain and she was a crazy person with symptoms straight out of the paranoia textbook yes doctor boys in the rain have been stealing my soul and not i dirty work v only that aliens have been giving me sinus headaches and the pentagon has been using an invisible ray that s disrupted my sex life too which was worse thinking you were going un or knowing you were going crazy the hair on the back of her neck she thought might have been standing up yes it very well might have now attend class we shall take our first steps out of the locked ward by walking to that it is only a bus stop where nothing ever happens except that perfectly ordinary people wait for a bus sometimes in the rain and it is not significant in any way to anyone least of all us the only un we are going to experience is that of going uncrazy she reached around the corner hesitated and forced herself to step off the curb and cross the street watching the bench and the bus stop sign grow larger as she approached behind her she could almost feel the lighted rectangle of the living room window seven stories up trained on her like a gunsight the dividers between the panes acting as the crosshairs except now there was no one to look through it she crossed the street forever and reached the
did you follow him last night christopher pushed his hair back from his face and took a bite of mutton before he answered because he told us he was a king he said but what business is that of yours christopher shrugged none really for the queen will seemed about to say something christopher looked at him and he subsided then oh why not he said aye we ll let everyone in london in on the secret we ll all be conspirators together you heard of course that someone tried to kill the queen yesterday aye tom said but the assassin shot an actor dressed to look like her instead his friend looked a little surprised and tom grinned he might not be an agent of the queen but he had his own ways of gathering information will and i were there christopher said surprising tom in turn queen elizabeth had apparently thought it amusing to trade places with an actor in a masque the thought saved her life the actor was killed and the man who shot her captured but he refuses to name his accomplices but surely he ca nt remain silent they ve tortured him he s said nothing but the odd thing one of several odd things really is that he seemed to expect the audience to rise up against the queen he had no idea how much her subjects love her and the other odd things arthur was on the stage with him the assassin brought him out and introduced him as the new king i do nt know if the plot was arthur s idea arthur he would nt would nt he well perhaps not then he was used by these other men who intended to put him on the throne but control him the way they might control a puppet how do you know there are other men involved perhaps the assassin was acting alone christopher ran his hand through his hair again his friend had been forthcoming so far tom thought he had been surprised at how much kit was willing to he start to dissemble it s complicated christopher said finally i saw a man die over this believe me there are others involved and next time they may succeed in killing the queen so you see how important it is to find arthur tom nodded now that you know will said will you help us of course tom said surprised no matter how open kit became he would never in his life think to ask for help he began to warm to this man of course i will what can i do tell us if you see arthur will said try to keep him in sight if he comes back to the tavern he has the most extraordinary smile tom thought aye he said but i fear he s gone to this new land that he s beyond our finding him christopher returned thought over what he had said feeling faintly surprised that he had told tom as much as he had he wondered why he had done so did he think he had to match will s openness with his own but will had been right tom might prove useful always assuming of course that tom stayed in this world and did not follow his fancies to lubberland or wherever he thought he had been still he was glad that he had not mentioned robert poley it was important that no one know the name of the man who had engaged him and especially important that will not discover it will might tell his brother geoffrey and geoffrey geoffrey knew something he should nt of that christopher felt certain people were still awake at the palace standing and talking in low voices candles guttered in iron coronas he heard his name called by several people all courtiers he barely knew there had been fresh gossip since the drama of the shaken and anxious to share what they heard sir francis walsingham the queen s principal secretary was dead fortunately for him he had been told nothing about the danger the queen had faced and so had died peacefully walsingham dead christopher thought as he went up the stairs to his room he was too tired to take it in but the confusion at court meant that he would not be expected to do any work for a few days he could find a quiet place and think about what he had learned the next day he made his way to the gallery and sat on one of the cushioned benches overlooking the courtyard morning light came in through the leaded windows illuminating each of the courtiers passing in colors as bright as an old manuscript did walsingham s death mean that his work here was finished he knew almost nothing about poley s arrangements with the principal secretary but if he discovered the plotters he would certainly be kept on gratefully rewarded by whoever work quickly though before someone newly come to power decided he was un necessary well then what did he know a man had shot someone he believed to be the queen an assassin who acted for a group of conspirators or did he what if tom of all people had been right what if the man had acted on his own behalf what evidence did he have for a conspiracy after all besides the fact that poley had told him there was one of course there was the note he had seen in the black boar and a note implied traffic between two people at least all is in readiness it had said our king awaits but it had been poley who had shown him the note nay that was ridiculous why would poley fabricate a conspiracy to make himself more useful to the principal secretary the queen faced enough dangers as he had seen without having to invent any had taken part in it
outside and sat down on the top step he reached for jada s hand and together they leaned back against the warm red bricks of the church they smiled as mr freean much and who had died a war hero they listened to the pulsating music of ravensfield entertaining its young sustaining its old and calling home all its departed it was more than music to dance to ravensfield music it was a paean of honor to the departed and for the living a reinforcement of their pact with life listening to the surging music jada could almost understand how it would be possible for a dancing couple to forget a baby sleeping in the cloakroom as the silver moon slid across the night sky the ravensfield orchestra played slower and slower all too soon the melody of the last dance began masie macentire spoke softly into the microphone and now goodnight sweetheart in the pale moonlit night jada starr and mr free man sat out the last dance on the top step of the church you would have liked my boy mr freeman said looking into the night and too liked you very much he sighed then turned to jada cute as a bug you are in your aunt s old party dress thank you mr freeman jada put her arm around his shoulder i know i would have liked your son i would have liked him very much that fourth of july night in ravensfield jada would remember always she could have sat forever on the church steps listening to the haunting melodies of the orchestra listening to the gentle memories of mr freeman because starr freeman was there with her but day follows night and in ravensfield it was a rainy day rain fell for five continuous days uncle mac fussed with his machinery in the quonset and looked through mail order catalogs with aunt may con tented when will this rain stop jada asked in exasperation she sat on aunt may s bed looking out the misty bedroom window only the red poppies pushing gray world soon uncle mac answered as soon as the alfalfa understands it is to start growing again and the green wheat decides it is time to ripen it will stop soon the first day of the rain aunt may asked jada to bring out her white satin sheets and her fuchsia bed jacket and to wash her hair after the hair washing jada had to change aunt may and herself but aunt may looked divine just in time for visitors in fact since all the visitors arrived wet and wrinkled aunt may looked better than anyone jada collected umbrellas at the front door and kept the floor mop handy she served cupcakes and posturn and she sat next to uncle mac and enjoyed the company aunt may was genuinely entertaining and she had the visitors in fine spirits before they left whether they had their first crop of hay stacked or not you are a vision of springtime may bishop in no time at all no time at all i am happy you think so aunt may murmured the freemans arrived somber and wet with neither umbrellas nor galoshes jada followed them with the mop to aunt may s bedroom it has been sixteen years may mrs freeman said as soon as she was seated she propped her patent leather purse on her lap then folded her arms over it and it seems like only yesterday aunt may sank into her pillows uncle mac and mr freeman nodded their heads solemnly i relived it all again at the dance the other night mr freeman said seemed as if young jada here was your rosanne she looks just like her she does nt look a thing like rosanne mrs free man said emphatically tall with frizzy hair i have been telling hyram that for two days but he just keeps thinking it was rosanne she looked at jada and frowned she has rosanne s ways uncle mac said kindly rosanne was a beauty mrs freeman declared she heaved a sigh and continued with difficulty they were so much in love and so young with so much to look forward to how could the good lord let it happen to our starr mrs freeman wept openly and although she accepted the handkerchief mr freeman offered she twisted it between her fingers and let her tears roll down her thin cheeks mr freeman cleared his throat is she coming home this summer we always look forward to her visits just as if she were our own daughter we have always considered her our daughter mrs freeman added starr would have wanted us to she is coming home the end of this month uncle mac said with her husband and children you understand aunt a fine man but there will never be any one except starr of course we know she was heartbroken mrs freeman said but what else could a young girl do trying to piece her life together oh it was a shock that telegram she continued i will never forget it i was home alone when mr blakely called from town i knew what was in that telegram before he read it he knew also and his voice was trembling he said i am afraid i have bad news for you mrs freeman is your husband in and i said no mr blakely just read it to me mr freeman reached over and touched her hand and our boy starr his voice was muffled his name on a bronze monument in front of the city hall and a gold star for our window that is all jada looked in anguish mac mrs freeman and mr freeman all closed faces and she realized that this same conversation had been repeated before this same scene played before many many times she slid from her chair excuse me she whispered leaving the room no one
familiar types of stores woven rugs silver concha belts turquoise jewelry and pottery for money to buy everything from food and tires to tools and seed it was hard to imagine growing things here july thought as he looked out the window the land was dry and harsh yet mysteriously beautiful as the light fell across the country the mountains appeared sharp against the sky the light kept changing the mountains buff colored minutes before began to turn a dusky mauve the van wound through canyons dotted with pinon trees then up again to higher land where strange rock formations writhed out of the ground like fantastic beasts occasional road signs indicated a creek or a wash which putnam explained was a dried up streambed in this empty land that seemed to have no boundaries the natural features became the reference points and the names for places there was a chaco wash and a tsaya wash and a red wash and places with strange sounding names like tsoodzil that linked the land to the the children that new world was a white man s name for a very old place this world had been here long long before the spanish and the europeans came to explore it a hogan putnam exclaimed our first hogan we re in navajo country for sure he slowed the van down and pointed out the window the land fell away into a shallow basin a dirt road wound off toward a cluster of rocks that popped out of the ground like giant elephant legs and cast long shadows in the afternoon light where the shadows ended was a dome shaped cabin made of logs putnam pulled the car to the side of the road so they could have a better look see it s an octagon eight sides putnam said there s the smoke hole in the center no smoke though nobody home i guess do the indians live in them liberty asked yes town they drove on more rocks with flat table like surfaces on top climbed out of the broken land we re getting closer to tres arroyos you can tell by all these mesas put said what are mesas charly asked these rock formations put pointed out the window they look like big flat tabletops lifting high up from the ground some of them are so big that whole villages are built on top of them the navajos live in the hogans they re basically loners some of them still herd sheep in the lonely stretches of high desert country the pueblos live in the rock and adobe villages often tending communally owned fields suddenly putnam swerved the van sharply onto the shoulder of the road what in the world shrieked madeline a ruin right on schedule ruin you nearly wrecked the car and ruined your family madeline was irritated look it is a ruin oh gasped liberty in front of them was an expanse of rugged broken land that ended at a red rock cliff face under its overhang a jumble of large cubes seemed to hang in midair and between the cubes were many levels connected by terraces it s an anasazi cliff dwelling madeline s voice swelled with delight she rolled down the window and stuck her head out a genuine ruin and a lovely one at that they drove closer and got out of the car to get a better look compared to the scale of the cliff and the immense arch of the sky the pueblo looked like a miniature village constructed from children s building blocks the simple geometric shapes were arranged in a pleasing pattern of terraces that followed the contours of the land and the mountains can we go explore liberty asked then all the twins began clamoring please please we want s getting late madeline said yes it is turning chilly and we do have more driving to do put added charly said the final words it s educational part of the southwest curriculum the four twins said at once and looked at zanny on all their adventures zanny dreamed up special courses to fit the particular place the starbucks were living this time it would be the southwest curriculum with the focus on the native americans of the four corners area the region where the corners of new mexico colorado utah and arizona came together this was the land where the pueblos and the navajo still lived where the anasazi known as the ancient ones had lived and then mysteriously vanished almost two hun dred years before columbus arrived in the west indies all eyes were turned toward zanny zanny looked at madeline madeline looked at put and they all started line over broken ground which was dotted with silvery green sagebrush and spires of bristling cactus toward the cliff that seemed to change color in the setting sun the rock turned from soft red to rose to deep amber and finally to dusky purple the family stood in the lavender shadows of the overhanging cliff they had climbed up onto a terrace and although they were cold not one twin dared show it it was a strange place this ruin the small windows pierced in the two foot thick adobe walls seemed like ghost eyes from a time long long ago what had the ghost eyes seen children playing on these terraces what a neat place to live so high up you could reach out your window and touch a cloud it s like a city in the sky the telepathic channels were busy as the children tried to imagine how people had lived in this odd place look over there kids zanny said pointing to a high see those pictures on the rock oh yeah july said softly almost straight above them carved into the rock was a series of shapes some simple geometric ones others the contours of animals i see a frog molly exclaimed i think i see
the hearing chamber stately stone and warm dark wood seats upholstered in dark faux leather bithras allen and myself deliberately dressed in conservative martian fashions alice on her freshly polished carriage with our synthetic clothing and unaltered physiques we must have resembled hicks in a litvid comedy but we were greeted respectfully by five senators from the standing committee on solar system and nearearth space light conversation with the senators and a few of their staff the air was polite but formal again i sensed something amiss as did bithras whose nostrils flared as he took his seat behind a long maple table allen leaned over and asked me why are nt we testifying before the whole committee i did not know i sat to the left of bithras in a hard wooden chair allen sat to his right alice was connected to the senate thinker harold s who had served the senate for sixty years the gallery was empty obviously this would be a closed hearing senator kay juarez sommers of new mexico chair of the committee gaveled the hearing into order i welcome our distinguished guests from mars you do nt know how odd that is for an old terrie like myself to say even today maybe i need some enhancements to the imagination certainly some of my colleagues think so she when appearance seemed an arbitrary choice small and wiry clean simple features smooth voiced dressing hard in blacks and grays senator juarez sommers had not chosen any easy roads in her life and she had eschewed obvious transform designs also attending the hearing today were senators john mendoza of utah tall chocolate skinned severely handsome and stocky senator david wang of california white blond with golden skin a fairly obvious transform and senator joe kim of green idaho of middle height grayhaired wearing an expression of perpetual suspicion or perhaps it was discernment mr majumdar as you can see this is a closed hearing juarez sommers began we ve chosen key members of the standing committee to hear your testimony we ll speak directly since our time is limited we re curious as to how much progress mars will make toward unification in the next five years we face major obstacles bithras said not all of them caused bithras explained the complex interactions of binding multiple finances and politics martian resources were about two percent developed earth based corporations with bm subsidiaries and lunar based bms controlled fifteen percent of martian capital and ten percent of developed resources mars based bms frequently sought capital from triple sources off mars establishing temporary liaisons even giving the outside sources some say in their internal affairs it seemed everybody had a finger in the martian pie organizing so many disparate interests was more than difficult it was nightmarish and it was made worse by the reluctance of healthy and profitable bms to submit to central authority do martian bms feel they have inalienable rights corporate rights as p it were no matter what the needs of their individual members asked senator mendoza of utah nothing so arrogant bithras said binding multiples operate more like groups of small businesses and families than worker owned earthstyle corporations family members are all shareholders but they can not sell their shares to any outside special election or birth transfer through marriage or election removes you from one bm and places you in another within the family there is exchange of work credits only no money as such all investments outside the family are directed by the syndic s financial managers the senators appeared bored bithras concluded quickly i m sure you re familiar with the principles they re the same on the moon and in the belts as well being aware of a pattern should imply being able to change it said mendoza our witness has just admitted to us that there is reluctance said senator wang of california glancing at his colleagues with raised eye brows mr majumdar s own binding multiple has been reluctant to cooperate with attempts to unify said juarez sommers perhaps he can give us insight into both the reluctance and the proposed nurturing of a new social pattern bithras tilted his head to one reluctant witness we have worked long and hard to determine our own destiny we behave as strong willed individuals within an atmosphere determined by mutual advantage we are naturally not inclined to place our destinies and lives in the hands of agencies who do not answer directly to us your binding multiples have lived under this illusion for decades said senator joe kim of green idaho are you telling us this is truly how mars works each individual interacting directly with family authorities no bithras said surely you have a system of justice that all bms subscribe to how do you treat your untherapied your ill adapted have nt we strayed from the subject a bit senator bithras asked smiling humor me kim said looking down at the slate before him iithras humored him they have rights if their maladaptation is severe their families persuade them to seek aid therapy if that seems crime transcends family boundaries they can be brought before council judges but martians are not enamored of therapy mendoza said staring at us one by one some of us in utah share their doubts we do nt embrace the concept as a fashion bithras clarified neither do we oppose it on principle we think perhaps an improvement in the mentality of martians as individuals might lead to a greater acceptance of more efficient social organization juarez sommers said glancing at mendoza with some irritation the senator is privileged to think that bithras said quietly that line of questioning was dropped the senators paused for a few seconds tuning in to harold s perhaps then resumed the questioning you re no doubt aware that the major alliances of earth have expressed unhappiness with martian backwardness juarez sommers said there s
our tongues in the company of strangers referring to our love of which they were ignorant but this time it seemed the word had slipped out of nina s mouth without any intention of me to bring up the izmailovi zoo what could i be thinking of afterward she told me that she had been so shocked by her father s execution that she could not speak for a month it was then that she had made up her mind to return to poland it was in and everyone predicted that after the war poland would he under russian influence she hoped that they would open the ix rders and allow her to return to the land of her birth i found it strange that she should see fit to tell me this it amounted after all to an admission that she had had no intention of waiting for me i said nothing what did it matter now exactly when she had decided to break off relations with me suddenly she asked me about galina nikolayevna and yefim i was very surprised i had no idea that she knew about the episode in question the miserable meeting on my way to the front took on a grudge she had not hesitated to take her revenge on me even though i was on my way from siberia to the western front she had not even thought that i deserved to know what i was being punished for and she still had the nerve to blame me for not taking the child s feelings into account i said nothing i adopted her own superior attitude toward sins made obsolete by the law of limitations she spoke about galina nikolayevna and yefim as if they were characters in a story that had nothing to do with her they were mentioned only in passing in order to clarify a point why she had considered that she was entitled to plan her return to poland without taking me into account there was a relaxed expression on her face but she could nt fool me the tension was apparent in her fingers which were tightly locked together she was pleased with the way the meeting had gone she had expected worse i had not been aggressive except for the remark about the monkey in the moscow zoo which seemed to her completely out of context nina saw that she could rely on me there was no danger of anonymous letters to her husband from my quarter nor did my occupation pose a threat a translator from hebrew into russian was not likely to make a lot of enemies and nevertheless there was a feeling of unfinished business in the air the meeting had not solved anything we had seen each other learned what had changed and what had not changed and so we were still tied together by an indissoluble bond in a moment of goodwill after we had spoken kindly of departed friends i asked her and now what for a moment she thought that i wanted to set a date for another meeting she embarked on a long explanation of all the difficulties in which this would involve her i cut her short this was not what i had had in her free of me entirely as far as i was concerned i said this formality did not bother me in the least but in her world among the people she knew nina looked at me coldly our marriage is not valid she said and there is thus no need for a divorce for a moment i was full of rage what do you mean not valid because we never got married according to the law of moses and israel yes in other words from their point of view you are permitted even to a cohen and i simply never existed at all my irony made no impression on her but when i added in that case why was it necessary to sweep me under the rug she tensed although she held her tongue until you learned the laws you must have entangled yourself in a pretty web of lies that grew more indifferent from one moment to the next and why should i have lied so that people would think you were a widow to avoid complications to be on the safe side i never lied i was certain that you had been executed she said calmly you were certain i even saw a certificate confirming it a certificate who could have shown you any such certifi cate leopold the pole i never succeeded in getting to the bottom of leopold sherrer he was the editor of a polish journal a tall frail man with sparse hair and skinny arms and exceptionally refined manners interested in yiddish literature he would visit the editorial office rummage about in the archives and engage in polemics with the poets once he came down to the printing press to look for something since we had already met at minkovsy s we got habit to drop in to visit me we became friends to the extent that it was possible to make friends with a stranger in those suspicious days he flattered me calling me the philosopher of the lead cauldron and this was nothing to be sneezed at for he himself was a graduate of the institute of philosophy the polish speakers were lavish in their praises his essays on aesthetics were philosophical gems in the course of time he fell into the habit of accompanying me home he would kiss nina s hand pat olga on the head and take his leave nina was truly lovely in those days blooming gay always excited if she heard a concert read a book saw something in the street she had to share her experiences with others leopold sherrer would listen to her and nod his head he never flirted with her he never gave her admiring looks made
bines said ya ll be well camouflaged with that i ca nt go downtown without a shotgun rils said staring at lucy no you should nt go walking around town without one that s no good is it rils looked at him quickly ya ca nt have my shotgun but i ll see about one bines said see if i can get you one he said nothing more while rils told his story of being in kingston penitentiary the only problem now was money could bines get him some money i do nt know if i can get ya no money bines said but there was all this jewellery that he had he had a thousand dollars worth of jewellery some and he would give it to bines for six hundred dollars do nt want it jerry said sparks flew out of a chimney two or three houses down and snapped off in the air a bargain a bargain rils said his voice carrying a tone of being stung do nt want it bines said do nt trust me do nt want it why do nt you i was your friend when you needed one i was there when you needed me do nt want it bines had met him in calgary for when you go anywhere in the middle of the night who do you go to but to those who will have you alvin had been going back and forth carting things to rils and the old dog followed him up and down stairs and now sat wagging its tail at the door it would hobble back downstairs when alvin went on it and fed it toast and jam and called it sugar foot and no matter how deeply it slept once alvin left the room it would lift itself up and hobble behind him only to lie down again where alvin sat that the old dog did this hopping along on its lame feet and wagging its matted tail looking up shamefully from one person to another as if trying to find a human it could understand bothered bines that is he could not stand to think that rils would torment alvin in front of his old lame dog or the dog in front of alvin bines glanced over at lucy and then at alvin as rils told a joke that was not so much off colour as childish rils said he wanted to go by christmas eve but he had a few people to take care of and some money to collect christmas eve rils said that ll give us time jerry tossed his head pitifully looked up at him thumping its tail downstairs alvin begged bines to take him away he ca nt stay here alvin said you have to take him he s your friend your friend your friend alvin was close to tears and it was sad to see him crying in front of his children hazel stood behind him now and could feel his legs trembling as he tried to smile the old dog came over and sat near them and gave a sad whine when it yawned bines sighed and looked at lucy she too seemed to be worried because the man upstairs was crazy he keeps talking about going out and killing an old woman or two he says the world would be better off without a few old women or about getting the pillars back i do nt know why he talks like that for she said and we have a house filled with little kids here if bines said as if to reassure them well that s all right for you to say but it s us who ll be dead alvin said jesus we have little girls here alvin whispered i might turn him in is what i might do no bines said go get him tell him to come with me bines once again felt the power of his own personality surge through him because of what he had just said but he also had nowhere to take rils he had burned his camp for one reason only so he would have no hiding place to offer now to protect others he felt he must find one rils made bines wait as he argued about leaving no i do nt want you to go it is nt me alvin said but you d be safer with jerry they came down the stairs twenty minutes sheet and carrying two teacups in his hand to take into the kitchen like a man who does nt want some guest and makes the appropriate gesture to clean up in front of him when he has hope enough in his leaving rils expression had changed he kept looking at bines one moment and then looking away abruptly whenever bines glanced at him he would notice rils eyes flit past him as cold in their blueness as bines eyes ever were it was a look of absolute certainty of his betrayal at the hands of others and instead of making him afraid it gave him a frightening inquisitorial appearance as if he were keeping score bines called rils percy a term of affection only a few people maintained with him and they left and walked out into the iron smelling snow their first falling out had been over the tractor trailer the man said and now they had come to the second falling out as soon as they got outside you could feel the dark the lumber sat off along the wharf covered by snow all the buildings were dark their slanted roofs casting shadows on the white earth as it was when jerry was a little boy the argument came because mr rils wanted to rob mr pillar that was the statement given by lucy savoie to constable petrie in her meeting with him on january the idea jerry had was to get rils some money and to get him off
said to no one in particular the other faculty members present looked at him in a way that said so what michael went to see arthur and explained to him the rather neat and profound role the pond played in the traditions of the campus it was nt much in hundred feet long by fifty feet wide but it was home for little geezers with orange legs who looked at michael when he walked by and went quack when he grinned and said hello to them it was also a place for moonlight walks and tender thoughts a place where ten thousand engagement rings had been slipped over shaking fingers through the years not to mention various other assignations getting a little more carnal late at night when michael looked out his office window he could see the ducks on their pond a block away and often he had found solace in that when dealing with education gone ber serk but guys like arthur j wilcox have no appreciation for tradition it s not tangible enough michael talked hard but it did nt register arthur just kept saying but michael we need a new building what about the ducks michael was angry where will they go are we going to build a new eighteen million dollar pond for either you could see it on his face that and the plain wish michael would just go away and leave him alone with his blueprints michael was pretty sure he would nt have raised as much hell about the duck pond as he did if he slow waltz in cedar bend had nt been half crazed with sorting out his feelings in those days trying to push jellie far back and out of his mind and failing in that attempt he worked his way up through the provost who did nt understand ducks any better than arthur stomping past clarice s desk on his way out of the provost s office he turned around then talked with her for a moment next he made an appointment to see the president michael laid out his case move the building keep the duck pond the prez was smooth years of dealing with demented faculty and recalcitrant alumni who stapled their checkbooks shut when they saw him coming had provided him with a sheen and style worthy your point of view slithering public relations man professor tillman i do understand your concerns tradition is important i agree with you but in evolving times we must sometimes cast off our old traditions and establish new ones i like ducks too in fact i m a member of ducks unlimited and go duck hunting every fall michael was wondering if in addition to professional incompetence and moral degradation presidential dismemberment was sufficient cause for loss of tenure one of the best students michael ever had went on to law school and stayed in cedar bend after grad uating michael called him gene what can be done to prevent these clowns from pouring cement over ducks and tradition gene always had a soft spot for radical causes so he looked into it he called back in two days flat out saying the building could nt be halted by legal robert james waller chicanery something to do with state law and a board of education screw em gene i m going to plant myself right in the middle of that pond and make em drag me out with chains michael i ll defend you free of charge if you do it but you re going to lose you ll be better off spending your time looking for another home for the ducks knowing bureaucrats hate bad publicity more than anything else michael wrote a long article for the university newspaper making what he thought was a powerful and eloquent plea to save the duck pond that started a fair amount of debate over the whole affair which drove arthur dotty arthur went completely out of his mind when the longhairs from the student socialist brigade made up signs reading save the ducks and began marching around bingley hall in their birkenstocks recruiters from the fortune who were on campus interviewing savvy students told arthur they were looking for good corporate citizens not radicals he took them over to the faculty club for periodic outbreaks coming down to us as a result of universities being too lenient in the sixties and it would soon be over afterward he took the recruiters to his office unrolled his blueprints and showed them all the wonderful space the new building would have for interview rooms they liked that a lot better the university newspaper was flooded for a few days with letters pro and con one of the bookstores slow waltz in cedar bend printed up t shirts with the logo ducks not cement and sold them for twelve dollars each proving once again capitalism can profit even from the concerns of its enemies michael was surprised to see jellie write a letter to the newspaper in support of his position it was a nice letter and he knew it probably caused her trouble at home since jimmy had dropped by to talk with him about the issue and seemed utterly amazed or perhaps bewildered that michael could get so worked up over eight or ten ducks but nobody except michael and the earthmoving machinery was carted into position on the back of big muddy trucks gambling on having a mild winter the contractors would begin digging on the following monday michael was sure the tame ducks would nt know how to handle the filling of their pond and contacted the humane society he and the society put a notice in the paper saying anyone who wanted to help in getting the ducks moved should show up early saturday morning and be prepared to get wet light frost lay upon the grass of autumn when michael rode the shadow through early light and
would be better off auditioning with barnum and bailey than trying to go to i u but i was not in the college advisement business thank god gee said macguire in a deep voice he tilted his head and eyed greer lovingly i d really like to go to vassar now that it s coed i want to watch the knicks play in new york and i ca nt get into columbia laughter erupted from the gallery miss ferrell protested greer with a shake of her straight perfectly cut blond hair he s not taking this seriously i am too said macguire i really really want to go to your school hammer uh he opened his eyes wide at greer and she tsked miss dawson miss ferrell gestured to greer to continue greer s sigh was worthy of any martyr i understand you we have a year abroad program as you know does that interest you not that much drawled macguire his mouth sloped downward i really hate spanish and german is too hard what interests me is your coed dorms i did my senior thesis on sexual liberation macguire please cried miss ferrell over the squeals of amusement i told you not to talk about sex religion or poli tics oh god fuck i m sorry miss ferrell well i do nt care about politics anyway macguire well i do nt want to go to vassar anyway he whined i ca nt get into stanford or duke i just want to go to indiana yes and we ve all seen just how likely that s going to be snapped miss ferrell let s get two more people up here and heather coopersmith what school interview do you want to role play julian julian shuffled between the desks he flopped into the chair formerly occupied by macguire ran his hand nervously through his mowed hair and said cornell for food science all right said miss ferrell heather she said to au drey s daughter a dark haired girl with her mother s face pinktinted glasses and thin pale lips let him ask the questions this is not fair greer dawson was miffed i did nt really get a chance that s true she did nt piped up her father you will you will said miss ferrell dismissively this is a learning experience for everybody but the period s almost over greer cried miss ferrell opened her eyes wide the sherbet colored dress trembled sit down greer all right about cornell from the gallery came the cry ask her about home ec can i learn to be a smart caterer here julian flushed a painful shade my heart turned over julian touched his tongue to his top lip i do nt want to do this now the exasperated miss ferrell surrendered all right go hack to your desks everybody during the ensuing chairscraping and body squishing she said people do you think this is some kind of joke she put her hands on her sherbet clad hips i m trying to help you she panned the classroom she looked like a parisian model who had been told to do peeved and the class was taking her about that seriously to my great relief the bell rang miss ferrell called out okay drafts of personal essays before you leave people i fled to a corner to avoid the press of jostling teenage ferrell was slapping papers around on her desk looking thoroughly disgusted quel dommage i said approaching her what a pity oh i did nt see you here she riffled papers on top of her roll book it s always like this until a few days before the deadlines what can i help you with did you come to see me there s no french club today no i was here to see the headmaster forgive me i just wanted to drop in because actually arch loves french club but he s having trouble with his schoolwork she looked up quickly did you hear about this morning she drew back her tiny body framed by a rumpled poster of the eiffel tower on one side and a framed picture of the arc de triomphe on the other when i shook my head she walked with a tick tock of little heels over to the door and closed it yes i said mr perkins told me about arch about his academic and social problems come to think of it he d only mentioned the schoolwork mess did he tell you about this morning no i said carefully just that arch was flunking a class just this is worse than that worse miss ferrell eyed me she seemed to be trying to judge whether i could take whatever it was she had to say i asked what happened to arch this morning we had an assembly the student body needed to know about keith her abrupt tone betrayed no feeling when it was over i m sorry to say arch had a rather strenuous disagreement with someone i closed my eyes for being basically a kind and mature kid arch seemed to be getting into quite a few disagreements lately i wondered what do you know we ve just had someone throw a rock through one of our windows and maybe later arch came and told me he d gotten into a fight with a seventh grader a boy who is frequently in trouble the other boy apparently said keith was a tattler puzzling most seventhgraders do nt even know seniors is that all no when arch arrived at his locker he found a nasty surprise i went to check and there was something there what you d better let me show you i put my own lock on the locker so it should be undisturbed she peeked out into the hallway the students had settled into the new class period so we were able to make it down to the row of
making her an offer sir robert came along and fell over head and ears in love with her and won her for himself the colonel married guy s s all there is to it julian wondered he pictured the colonel and lady fontclair leaving the gun room arm in arm lady tarleton s insinuating voice rang in his ears touching is nt it how fond they are of one another look here said macgregor when you said you could make a case against all the fontclairs except hugh you ca nt have meant to include lady fontclair among your suspects yes i did but we ll pass over her if you d rather no let s hear what you ve got to say i d just as soon know the worst you know i like her too you do nt like anybody and you do nt trust anybody i ca nt afford no what s the use he rose would you rather i put an end to this discussion and this visit look not in so many words then sit down and behave yourself you ought to know better than to take to heart what i say when i m in a temper julian smiled and sat down again the case against lady fontclair it s not a strong one if sir robert is telling the truth he left her alone for only about a quarter of an hour during the period between half past four and six she was nt entirely alone even for that short time miss fontclair passed through the conservatory and spoke with her there might just have been time for lady fontclair to let the girl in through the conservatory windows bring her to my room and kill her but even assuming she could do it it s devilish hard to imagine that she would then why not rule her out well there are some disturbing facts lady fontclair says you ve taught her a good deal about medicine that means she has some knowledge of anatomy and probably is nt as squeamish as most of us would be about cutting into human flesh and she must know the house and its routine better than anyone it was most likely she who decided which room i would have and she repeatedly urged hugh to take me out for a long ride late yesterday afternoon clearing the way for her to kill the girl in your room while you were out kestrel i know her the same as you know your servant she would nt do a thing like that i could imagine her firing a gun or raising a knife against oh say a housebreaker who threatened her children but if nothing else she d never plan a murder at bellegarde and take the risk that anyone in her family or even any of her servants would take the blame for it this might not have been a planned crime but i admit what about sir robert is he on your list of suspects yes but i grant you the odds are lombard street to ninepence he had nothing to do with the murder he has an alibi for most of the period in question assuming he and lady fontclair are nt lying to shield each other and given his sense of right and justice it s devilish hard to imagine him committing a crime like this what is nt so hard to imagine is that he thinks or fears one of his family is guilty the question is does he have a particular one in mind and how far would he go to protect that person i do nt like to think of the dilemma he d face if he thought the murderer was one of his own family it may be worse than that you know how could it possibly be worse it may not be only one of them two or more together macgregor clutched at his hair see here kestrel is nt it just possible this is all the work of some aggrieved labourer attacking the local squire it happens you know though it has nt happened around alderton for lord knows how many years i do nt know much about those sorts of rural conflicts but would nt there have been a threatening note left behind a demand for redress well probably macgregor heaved a sigh and resumed his pacing finally there s miss fontclair there s a good deal of circumstantial evidence against her she admits to having passed close to my old room at about twenty minutes past five she had her sketching box with her which contains a small but very sharp knife that she uses to sharpen her pencils she s been very frank about all this that may mean she has nothing to hide it may also mean she s trying to disarm us with third possibility she may be trying to draw suspicion away from someone else who i do nt know the most obvious person he thought would be lady fontclair whom isabelle said she had met in the conservatory when she came in through the french windows but suppose isabelle had been lying suppose lady fontclair had not been in the conservatory while sir robert was gone suppose that instead of seeing her there isabelle had seen her a little while later outside julian s room he went on of course as a suspect miss fontclair presents a number of problems she was outdoors for the most of the time in which the girl could have been killed she might have brought the girl in with her through the conservatory windows but in that case we have to posit some sort of conspiracy between her and lady fontclair who says she came in alone she might have let the girl in through the front door at about that time they might all have missed one another but it seems farfetched and there
she said to me babies stay just the same i thought a lot about the two of them both past sixty and finally getting to have a baby of their own i was glad for them i could see it was no burden but still i wished it was nt my baby they had at the end of the day rose and i went over to june s and took sissy back june acted like we were tearing her heart out of her chest she ll be back in the morning june said first thing rose said june watched us walk back toward our house beside the hotel this is nt right i said to rose sissy fussing a little in my arms leaving i feel sure cecilia got more attention today than most children get in a lifetime i just do nt like it i said she stopped in the snow halfway between saint elizabeth s and our house we looked at each other in the darkness the stars behind her head looked like a decoration for rose i m tired she said quietly and i did nt say see there i told you and i did nt say that s what you get i said come on then let s get you home the next morning when i was on the second floor finishing up work on a sink flat on my back and staring up at the curved underside of a washbowl mother corinne came in son she said i wo nt have this i sighed sat up and wiped my hands i d gotten good at being careful not to hit my head she s not a resident anymore she should nt be here she s my wife now mother then she should stay at home as your wife im none too pleased about the way all of this went it was nt the time to talk to you before but i ll have you know this is a great disappointment to me i trusted you son if i d known you were going to be picking out girls for yourself i would have dismissed you years ago i stood up because mother corinne used her size to bully people since we both know that s not so i think it best we just do nt get into it she flushed a little bit the point of this conversation is your wife s continuing to work in our kitchen which is unsatisfac tory the thing you had to do if you were going to deal with mother corinne was forget about her being a nun i stuff took all her guff for years because she was supposed to be a woman of god you had to deal with her as straight as she dealt with you or you were dead in the water the way i hear it told the food went downhill fast with rose gone sister evangeline ca nt do it anymore she has nt been able to for years and she ca nt have a different girl coming and going for each meal she needs someone to look after her and she wants that someone to be rose as for my feelings i d tend to agree with you she s not getting paid and she s working like a horse which do nt make much sense to me i d say we should all be thankful for what s set before us mother corinne mulled on this for a minute she was not one to set her teeth so far into something that she could nt let go when presented with the truth if she s not asked to be here but if she wants to help for a while she said then i suppose that could be arranged but her daughter will have to stay at home this is no place for children surely even you would be able to understand that i understand that fine i said sissy is staying with june clatterbuck then this conversation is concluded she said except for this when you want to get rid of rose you go tell rose not me i turned the cold water faucet water came out fixed it i said mother corinne nodded toward the sink and left me there i did nt scare her and i did nt try to we d been around each other for so long and we both admitted at least to ourselves that we were dependent me on the work and her on the worker but from anybody and if you tried to tell her what to do chances were she was going to tell you to go to hell sissy was pure joy as smart and loving a child as god s made being around so many people while she was growing up made her friendly children are like pups sister evangeline told me the more people picking them up and playing with them the more people they ll grow up liking in their life by the time she was three she d started coming over to saint elizabeth s for lunch and when she was four she was pretty much around all the time it happened gradually so that even mother corinne was used to her she still went over to june s every day but it was almost like she was too busy to spend the whole day with one person all the girls wanted their time with her they wanted to brush her hair and read her stories they wanted to get to be mothers in their own right at the hotel she was the center of the world and it made her sweet where another child might have turned spoiled with all the excitement that came from spending her days at saint elizabeth s sissy must have found the evenings dull two quiet parents and a little house her mother read cookbooks at the kitchen table or did a
chapter one lt st james keep bavia what the deuce is she doing up there rafael st james prince of bavia demanded bending as far out his chamber window as he could without plunging headfirst into the empty moat a light and drizzling rain was falling that gloomy evening in late may but he could see all too clearly annie trevarren a lithe barefooted figure clad in a pair of kidskin breeches and a flowing shirt that might have been pinched from his own wardrobe was embracing the face of a gargoyle on the crumbling parapet of the south tower rafael felt an inward wrench at the sight of her a tug born of something other than fear for her safety beside him his eighteen year old sister phaedra fidgeted and wrung her hands annie wanted a clear view of the lake she said as if that were reason enough to risk life and limb you must nt be angry rafael runs in the trevarren family you know he cursed miss annie trevarren and her alleged adventurous nature as he whirled away from the window and sprinted across the room toward the yawning doors which stood a little ajar because of phaedra s abrupt entrance the princess scurried along behind him moving as rapidly as her cumbersome skirts would allow and prattling the whole way rafael ran down the hall toward the enclosed staircase in the southern most corner of the keep annie occasionally does impulsive things but she invariably regrets them later and makes up for her errors quite nicely and she is extremely practical in most instances rafael ignored his sister s breathless blatherings in defense of her friend and schoolmate and ran as fast as he could directing his thoughts to annie hold on you little fool just hold on his bodyguard and childhood friend edmund barrett reached the stairs at the same moment as rafael it was plain from the consternation in the other man s normally trevarren s predicament or had seen it for himself let me handle this your highness he began barrett tended to address rafael formally in any emergency rafael shook his head and pushed past barrett to mount the spiral steps he was still the master of st james keep however tenuous his hold on the rest of the country might be and thus responsible for the safety of those within its ancient walls not to mention the young woman s parents patrick and charlotte trevarren were among his most valued friends what would he say to them if annie fell to her death that they still had four daughters left and should nt trouble themselves over the loss of the eldest the little minx was a guest in his house had been for a week and it was his responsibility to look after her the door at the top of the staircase was open of course and rafael stepped cautiously over the threshold annie stood several yards away embracing the gargoyle with both arms her red gold hair tumbled down her back and curled in the moist air do nt worry annie phaedra called from just behind the prince s right shoulder rafael will save you be quiet and stay back rafael hissed assessing the state of the parapet itself the rain smelling of settled dust cooled his skin to annie he said do nt move apparently st aspasia s academy for young women of quality where both annie and phaedra had spent the past few years learning manners and deportment had served at least some part of its purpose even in that dire situation and it was dire for the girl was standing on loose pebbles and very little else she smiled bravely and nodded though she was pale and trembling i wo nt she promised in a stoic tone rafael indulged a perverse desire to look down the brick dusk and a number of spectators had congregated their torches making spots of fire he closed his eyes for a moment and offered a silent prayer to a god who had long since abandoned him then eased out onto the ledge some of the stone fell away beneath his feet and he leaned back against the moss slickened wall arms spread wide breathing deeply should the trevarren chit be fortunate enough to survive this folly he reflected he might well murder her himself do be careful annie counseled as though he were the one who needed rescuing rafael felt color surge up his neck and pulse along his jawline as he moved closer to her ever so slowly progressing by inches and fractions of inches i was nt planning to hang by my feet or do handstands miss trevarren he replied reasonably this was no time or place after all to lose his temper if they were both lucky he would have he vowed to himself he d deliver a lecture this little hellion would never forget after that he might just throw her into the dungeon or hang her up by her thumbs he reached annie s side on the strength of these fantasies and slipped one arm around her waist all right miss trevarren he said quietly with a calmness he did nt feel release your hold on the masonry if you will and we ll start back it s going to be a slow process though no sudden moves or we ll both be splattered on the stones of the courtyard understood remarkably he felt her bristle ever so slightly against his rib cage believe me your highness she said with stiff dignity your instructions were quite clear rafael risked a step holding his breath rejoicing inwardly when the parapet held he muttered something meaningless even to himself and they progressed another wall then tumbled soundlessly through space the mist had turned to hard rain soaking annie s clothes and hair extinguishing the torches below and making the stones of the narrow walkway slippery as well
a half james had been gone finn had written another three pages of his essay and had composed the covering letter no doubt james would be upset that he intended to run an errand particularly this errand before going home damn had he not taken so much wine last night he would ve been able to get up earlier to finish picking up the house earlier and to make his stop before coming to the airport but if there had to be a showdown then there would be a showdown this was his only life and there was only so much of it left he could nt concentrate on timon of athens at last passengers with suitcases and garment bags began straggling down the long passage from the gates to the security station no one had even bothered to announce the arrival the slipshod way everything was run these days would make a saint querulous yet he must nt visit this querulousness on james who would need his support now his canvas duffel bag slung from his shoulder and in his other hand what a net bag of oranges finn gave him a brotherly one armed hug james bent to lay the oranges on the floor straightened up gripped the back of finn s neck and kissed him on the lips this is new york city said james remember forgive an old man said finn giving his still one armed hug another pump when ye git my age sonny if said james finn let go james s tan he noticed was even deeper than when he d left so something more had been going on apparently than just the compulsive tv watching and the silent family dinners he d re created so amusingly on the phone ah nature s bounty said finn bending to pick up the oranges my mother insisted said james both of us well well well said finn god and sinners reconciled but would nt pink grapefruit have been more appropriate james began walking the sight of his firm buttocks under his white shorts made finn suddenly furious your tan looks splendid he said catching up so how are the beach girls down there really stacked i ll bet james stopped people went by on both sides paying no attention hey finn said james why do nt you give it a rest o k i m just really not up to it it s been a bad week yes i can see it must have been hell said finn appalled that he could nt shut up i do nt believe this is happening said james i ve been off the plane for two minutes and already we re in sorry jamie said finn i do nt know what the hell s wrong with me can we not stand here in the middle of all this sorry here he touched james s shoulder to guide him we re parked down this way they walked a few steps towards the escalator and james stopped again look he said would you rather i just took a cab into the city and got out of your life jamie i m truly because i do nt seem to be making you very happy and you re driving me out of my mind you re shouting said finn what these people have never seen a pair of bickering faggots before well he was shouting now at any rate james said finn for christ s sake said james well my parents have a pool man in their backyard which is where i sat for nine days man watching game shows with my mother she keeps a tv out there so she can work on her tan she looks like distressed leather my father meanwhile sits in the den with the blinds closed watching i kid you not old super bowl games on his vcr he s got tapes of all but four of however fucking many super bowls there are and he s scared shitless and he eats so much valium his flesh is turning to balsa wood i m so sorry said finn look said james do you mind very much if we get out of here in the parking garage finn unlocked the passenger door first james in turn reached over and unlocked the driver s door which finn took as a sign of conciliation he decided not to and stroked the back of james s head james allowed it when they came out into the sunlight it was still only five o clock finn put on the air conditioning james had taught him that it was more fun to keep the windows open when the air was on even though it was nt fuel efficient on the grand central traffic in the other direction was motionless but inbound it was moving right along i hate to backseat drive said james but should nt we be in the other lane ordinarily said finn but i need to make a quick stop off in midtown for what finn drew a long breath let it out for something you do nt approve of he said oh said james he looked at his watch you know it s going to take hours to get in and out of manhattan at this time your way i m sorry said finn i ll make this as quick as i possibly can but i get to the city so seldom that i really must nt pass up the chance so this is why you were so anxious to come down and pick me up said james tell me something do you ever think your tastes might be a little depraved we ve been over this said finn well let me put it in another light for you said james did it ever occur to you that it might be insulting to me they were caught behind a huge yellow school bus the lanes on either side were nt
another black pasty morning shrouded the camp and nacho like always was up early getting ready for his job as a porter in the library i saw him with a can of magic shaving powder he shaved about every fourth day but the job was a daily thing and at least twice a week the librarian threatened to write him up over his beard stubble usually with a guard present finally he would shave i never liked that aspect of working either just tighter confinement around the rules of prison like a hat size that was constantly being reduced but i knew nacho he had lived across from me in the dorm for close to a year one of the first things i had noticed were the two teardrops he had green teardrops tattooed below the corner of his left eye each drop represented five years in stir he also had a large cobra coiled in the small of his back of his neck his arms were designed with affiliation symbols club symbols and during the lockdowns when separated from his homeboys we sometimes kicked it together but since i was nt working i had nacho get me up that morning for breakfast he d said that the school across from the library might be looking for another porter the plan was to check it out with him after chow the rest of the dorm just snored contentedly like apes stretched out in a tropical lull i lay in bed scratching not at all eager to work or to hustle up one of their jobs i knew that porters were a special type of janitor who hung out a lot on the job after they cleaned and mopped and did the rest of their schedule they were often contacts between yards running a sort of messenger service for small favors no room for scrubs in this line of work but most of them had been fucked over at one fresh from the academy who confused prison with the duties of a high school hall monitor yet nacho had tried to school me the previous night he explained it this way capone atwood all them old gangsters used to be porters now you have crips and el rukins bloods who are porters yeah i had told him shit he said it s an honorable tradition a tough tradition he then leaned a little closer i heard that james brown worked as a porter the godfather ese a real classy bro in the union i had told him all right i might become a porter but as usual i was thinking about my own ass we were in a high medium institution and you got fucked around badly if you did nt hire on somewhere they started by having you rake rocks on the track by the dorms which enclosed took an amount of good time and put you on the shotgun crew when you told them to jam that crew you were taken off the yard placed in a higher super maximum run and given a cell with some headcase i knew there were plenty of nuts around our camp and felt no need to be on a permanent lockdown basis with one so i figured the sensible thing would be to cover myself to just fart along with the game until i made a lower security yard and since jobs meant bosses and authority i also thought it would be sensible to work as little as possible it was barely seven o clock in the morning nacho came back wearing blue striped boxers scuffling the floor with his shower shoes he dumped the shaving material on his bed and sat down opened his locker i saw the roll on his stomach and the old knife wound which glowed like cartilage upon his left side someone had once caught him from behind or the other about who had the claim to a job opening i exhaled sawdust from the last of my cigarette thinking of breakfast peeling slowly at first from my sheets to get dressed our shirts were blue the air was black my rug was a towel i had folded under the bunk and the dorm was freezing when you had hot arizona skin i got into my clothes as quickly as possible the light from the bathroom like a white frosting on my eyes i glanced at grissom my cellmate as i tied on my boots he was all right he just snored under the hairy black blanket nacho still sat on his bed in his boxers unfolding t shirts his television on i tucked in my shirt and called him a cold calloused motherfucker he put his teeth together and hissed at the wall five minutes he said adjusting the volume on his set always this nervous bit of him but i need some air i wan na breathe air again su aliento huele a mielda he said your breath smells like shit no doubt i put my jacket on and went outside spitting at the trash can that stood near our walk i glanced at the sky the world up there was like an asphalt parachute rugged wet charcoal the yard and the trailers looked worse like filmed reports i d seen of outback nicaragua the smarter convicts wore stocking caps going into and coming out of the chowhall i drifted looking for my breath against the clouds and porters went through this shit every morning nacho came out jacketless wearing his shades fuck he said cold out here but all he did was shrug we footed it the short distance to the chowhall there was a short line when we arrived we walked up the cattle at the corner to the right it was spacious almost elevated in there though a hundred steel tables were cemented in the floor each table was fitted with four attached stools and glowed under these snarling length long fixtures
my mother stumbles going through the door and mr arnette catches her leads her inside then he comes back out grunts and sits down on the porch step what have looking through this i say holding up the album he is quiet for a moment then he says you ever see your father he says it almost as an afterthought but to something that was nt said he says it like we ve been on the porch together all night discussing my father for hours like he was really one of the family just in here i say think he s still a good looking guy dashing i imagine i say he snorts out a laugh why d you marry her i hear myself ask he leans back rests his head on the wood inches from my feet company he says he yawns and i can see him now too safety glass that still shatters he begins to snore mr arnette i say i reach down he does nt move i go into the house and up the stairs their bedroom door is closed and i imagine my mother is in about the same shape as he is but that they will sleep it off in different places with dreams of different people s arms when i open my door my mother is standing in my room the empty bottle of xanax in one hand the other hand palm up as if she were questioning someone even before i arrived wait a minute i say just wait i knew it she says i knew there was something wrong nothing s wrong i say what are you doing in my room you scared me standing there like that her mouth opens i scared you i do nt think i need those anymore i say forgive me if she says i want a cigarette bad i had to go all night without them and i go to the dresser for my pack a light i say do you have a light not on your life she says i m fine i say i accidentally break the cigarette between my fingers and reach for another one she sits down on the bed you hurt people she says quietly not just me you think you take those pills because i do nt want you to hurt me i never hurt anybody i say you are so lucky she says you could have killed both of us five times over in the dressing room did you ever think about the woman in the next one i was nt trying to hurt anybody i say you do nt she says she sets the empty bottle on the bed and stands up i m sorry she says i can only live with this for so long she leaves i hear her bedroom door close the house is silent below me mr arnette sleeps on the porch i sit down on the bed i am crazy all right i have always been crazy i see my mother standing on the front porch as i get out of my first police car only fourteen braces squeezing my teeth she stares at me in disbelief when the police tell her that i have caused over a thousand dollars in damage at the record store a thousand dollars with only one match it is then that she begins to look at me like a stranger it s monday again and she is in her bedroom preparing mr arnette sits in the rocking chair watching a basketball game i am on the couch you to go back into the hospital he says he does nt look at me he moves his glasses from hand to hand i know i say it s o k it s not so bad there anybody play parcheesi a man on the court has lost his contact lens players are on their knees hunting cards mostly i say lots of jigsaw puzzles he nods you take those drugs today no i say soon enough it s funny being able to see so well but not great so much my mother comes into the room and picks up her purse have a good game she says she kisses mr arnette on the top of the head presses her lips into his hair for a long time until he moves away what was that for i can tell it does nt have to be for anything does it she says she smiles at me lingers for a moment as if she has something to add but can not remember what it could have been and then she leaves mr arnette swings the rocking chair around and faces me you do nt have to go he says imagine me here all by myself you ll do o k i say come visit he nods picks up the poetry book from the coffee table where my mother has left it absently flips through it she did nt even think to take it along he says she does nt try so hard anymore i say to fool anybody he stops on a page squints at it puts on his glasses here s one you d like he says in fire others say in ice he stops looks up at me and raises his eyebrows i d like to see them i say i hear my mother s car start up in the driveway lust one time see them together be a fly on the wall we can be flies together he says it is not a long drive only a few miles much too close as far as i m concerned for something that seems like it must be another world mr arnette stays a few cars behind her then drives past the motel after she pulls into the lot he drives around the block twice the three times what are you waiting for i ask him a reason not to do
used to grab us by the hair on the back of our necks tilting our heads so we looked into his face i want you to look at me when i talk to you that was about the worst of it until del started getting into trouble and by that time my father s blows were nt enough del would laugh he would strike back it was then that my father finally decided to turn him over to the authorities he had no other choice he said he must have believed it he was nt despite his temper a bad man a bad parent he d seemed so kindly sometimes so fatherly especially with del i remember watching them from my window some autumn mornings watching them wade through the high weeds in the stubble field out behind our house walking toward the hill with their shotguns pointing at the ground their steps slow synchronized once i d gone upstairs and heard them laughing in del s and my bedroom i just stood there outside the doorway watching as my father job their talk easy happy this was what i thought of that night we were talking i thought of my own son the innocent baby i loved so much and it chilled me to think that things could change so much that del s closeness to my father could turn in on itself transformed into the kind of closeness that thrived on their fights on the different ways del could push my father into a rage that finally my father would feel he had no choices left we looked at each other my father and i what are you thinking i said softly but he just shook his head del and i had never been close we had never been like friends or even like brothers yet after that day on the elevator i came to realize that there had been something between us there had been something that could be taken away he stopped talking to me altogether for a while in the if we even looked at each other more than two or three times though we shared the same room for a while i slept on the couch i was afraid to go up to our bedroom i can remember those first few nights waiting in the living room for my father to go to bed the television hissing with laughter the furniture the table the floors seemed to shudder as i touched them as if they were just waiting for the right moment to burst apart i d go outside sometimes though that was really no better it was the period of late summer when thunderstorms seemed to pass over every night the wind came up the shivering tops of trees bent in the flashes of heat lightning there was no way out of the situation i d created i could see that days and weeks stretched out in front of me more than a month before school started by that time i thought maybe it the whole series of bad things that had happened another layer of paint that would eventually be covered over by a new one forgotten if he really had pushed me that was what would have happened it would have been like the time he tried to choke me or the time he tried to drive the car off the hill once those incidents were over there was always the possibility that this was the last time there was always the hope that everything would be beer now in retrospect it would nt have been so hard to recant there would have been a big scene of course i would have been punished humiliated i would have had to endure my brother s triumph my parent s disgust but i realize now that i would nt have been so bad i might have finally told the truth too if del had reacted the way i expected i imagined that there would be a string of confrontations in protest with my father i figured he would nt give up but he did after that night he did nt try to deny it anymore for a while i even thought that maybe he had begun to believe that he pushed me he acted like a guilty person eating his supper in silence walking noiselessly through the living room his shoulders hunched like a traveler on a snowy road my parents seemed to take this as penitence they still spoke sternly but their tone began to be edged by gentleness a kind of forgiveness did you take out the trash they would ask another potato and they would wait for him to quickly nod he was truly sorry they thought everything was finally going to be o k he was shaping up at these times i noticed something in his eyes a kind of sharpness a subtle shift of the iris he would lower his head to me his face seemed to flicker with hidden mysterious thoughts when i finally began to sleep in our room again he pretended i was nt there i would come in almost as quiet as he himself had become to find him sitting at our desk or on his bed peeling off a sock with such slow concentration that it might have been his skin it was as if there were an unspoken agreement between us i no longer existed he would nt look at me but i could watch him for as long as i wanted i would pull the covers over myself and just lie there observing as he went about doing whatever he was doing as if oblivious he listened to a tape on his headphones flipped through a magazine did sit ups sat staring out the window turned out the light and all that time his face remained neutral impassive once he even chuckled to himself at a book he was reading when
crazy angles to one another to accommodate the dividing curtains he set up his wife with a sitz bath in the narrow bathroom through the curtains he could hear a nurse scolding one of the new mothers you have to change him she said it s your responsibility the walls of the bathroom were green and when the door opened and his wife came out from her sitz bath and maneuvered herself into bed her section of the room was washed with a greenish light he tucked her in and asked if she wanted her teddy bear she shook her head no he was not allowed to stay in any of the parents rooms because they had all been previously booked and he was not allowed to stay in his wife s room he found a small waiting room across from blanket from his wife s bag the room was airless and dark and cold and he did not think he could sleep he woke to the feeling of someone recovering him with the blanket is that you he said what time is it a quarter to four he made himself get up into the cold room he walked out into the hallway with her there were still skins of little puddles where he d dropped the ice as they hurried along the corridor to the icn he asked her if she d heard anything nothing she said their baby s side of the nursery was well lit in an enclosed room off to the right a woman in blue scrubs bent over a spiral notebook with a four color pen she looked up nodded at the parents and scrawled on a ruled line they washed their hands for one minute and pulled on the sterile yellow gowns he put his baby they stood by the side of the bed her belly was puffed up and her chest fluttered in regular wingbeats as the respirator fed her air a dark ring of crusted blood had formed around the white tube at her umbilicus her cheeks pursed against the white adhesive tape and dried perspiration left a film around her eyes and on her forehead at two of the iv insertions one at the foot and one on the hand little bulbs of orange light had been attached in an almost ornamental fashion you can touch her someone said behind them and talk to her too she ll recognize your voices it was the doctor leaning against his sink the mother reached out and stroked an unmarred length of the baby s arm when she was finished the father felt along the soft skin patches flaking with a layer of birth fluid you re the only ones who touch her who wo nt hurt her us touches her he smiled apologetically it s to start an iv or suction the breathing tube the mother bent down to the baby hi sweetie she said how is she doing the father said the pictures were not good the doctor looked at both of them as the mother turned from the baby but she s shown great resiliency her heart is normal she s urinating which means her kidneys are in order he pointed at the respirator settings you can see for yourself she needs a hundred percent oxygen eighty breaths a minute she s not processing it that well we ll have to wait and see she s not stable the mother said she s critical the doctor said how many cases of this do you see a year the father said the doctor shrugged happens next the mother said we ll have to see the father touched his daughter s arm gently scraped away some of the flaking an alarm gonged the father was horrified the woman in blue scrubs came out from her office and shut the sound off looked around at the father and the mother and the doctor i do nt think you should touch the baby she said they can touch the baby the doctor said she pulled up a high cushioned chair on wheels and sat next to the bed with her notebook where were we the doctor said the father was torn between wanting to be with the baby as closely as he could to let her know he was there and wanting to listen to the doctor the mother lay a pinky in the baby s hand and the baby squeezed it her face grimacing around the white tape another alarm beeped and clicked it off do you have any family here the doctor said to the parents no the mother said they re all on the east coast they ll be coming out the father added quickly good the doctor said he started to leave then tapped the white index card on the side of the warming bed that said baby girl keenan let us know when you name her he said when he was gone the woman in scrubs looked up from her book i did nt mean to be rude she said it s just better for the baby if she rests as quietly as possible she got up and retreated to the little office behind the glass windows they stood by the baby in the mother s bag in her room was a list of a half dozen boys and girls names but they had for the boy emery for the girl after the mother s grandfather the girl lay there in sleep with her knees at a slightly jaunty angle as if perhaps she could push herself up and run off the father did nt want to name her just yet to name her would be to somehow condemn her he felt superstitious just as he d been about calling the grandparents he felt it was better to wait until everything was in the state it ought to be he could feel the pressure of his wife beside him wanting
of his father s debts within two years daniel said there was cool admiration in his voice he rebuilt his father s fortune from scratch it s now far larger than it was before edward rain disappeared which should tell you something about oliver poor oliver annie whispered he must have been emotionally devastated when his father vanished daniel frowned in alarm now annie the shame and humiliation would have been intolerable to a man like that annie continued thoughtfully he s obviously been scarred for life no wonder he s not very outgoing hold it right there daniel ordered don t even think about it about what annie asked innocently about trying to rescue oliver rain he is definitely not another wounded stray male you can add to your everyone needs to be rescued at one time or another daniel not rain daniel said flatly that man can take care of himself trust me annie did not see or hear from rain again until two weeks later he had called the day after daniel s private plane went down in the ocean on a flight to alaska that had been a month ago in october rain had asked her very gently if she needed help of any kind caught up in the chaos of the situation struggling to deal with reporters and the authorities who were conducting the search and rescue operation as well as trying to console joanna annie had been tense and distracted she had brusquely told oliver rain that she did not need his assistance it was only as she hung up the phone that she belatedly recalled the fact that rain was her brother s chief creditor now that daniel had disappeared rain was a potential threat if he chose to call fledgling company lacked leadership lyncroft unlimited would go under there was simply no way to pay off oliver rain at this point but it was nt rain who had turned out to be the immediate threat it was a coalition of suppliers and the other investors all of whom panicked when they realized that daniel was no longer at the helm of his company barry cork daniel s trusted assistant did the best he could to reassure everyone that business was going on as usual but no one believed him a few days later rain had called again perhaps we had better talk he said quietly about what annie demanded knowing full well what he wanted to discuss lyncroft s future lyncroft is doing just fine thank you barry cork has everything under control my brother will be rescued any day now and everything will go back to normal i m sorry ms lyncroft but you must face i do nt believe that and neither does his fiance we re going to hold lyncroft together until he returns annie gripped the phone cord and tried to keep her voice calm and confident i appreciate your concern but nothing has changed at the company everything s under control i see there was a long silence on the line i hear rumors that some of your brother s other creditors are starting to press for a sale or merger nonsense strictly rumors i ve explained to all ofthem that things are fine and that we expect daniel to return soon there was another thoughtful silence as you wish please feel free to call me if the other investors become difficult i might be able to help you annie had hung up the phone feeling more uneasy than ever lyncroft unlimited was a family owned corporation no one except family members could hold stock in the firm daniel had been intent on there were only two members of the lyncroft family annie and her brother that made annie daniel s sole inheritor two weeks ago rain had again contacted her instead of talking about the fate of lyncroft unlimited he had explained that he was requesting her services in a professional capacity he wanted her to provide the finishing touches for the rooms in his new penthouse annie was still not quite sure why she had accepted the job she certainly had more than enough to do without taking time out of her frantic days to provide personal consultation to a client but today was her fourth visit to the twenty sixth floor of the downtown seattle high rise thus far it had followed the same pattern as the previous visits it was nt easy getting to oliver rain first she had to get past the doorman in the lobby of the building there was a special code that had to be punched into the elevator control panel in order to get to the twenty sixth floor when she arrived robot of a man known only as bolt he appeared to be a combination of butler and chauffeur annie wondered if he was also a bodyguard in his own way bolt was almost as interesting as his employer he looked to be somewhere in his early fifties every time annie had seen him he had been wearing a formal dark suit his pale blue eyes betrayed no emotion of any kind his thinning hair was razored to within a quarter of an inch all over his head there was a mechanical quality about bolt that made annie wonder if he was part machine she had visions of him plugging himself into an electrical outlet each night to recharge his batteries she got the distinct impression he did not approve of her on that first visit bolt had shown her into the study with a minimum of words tea had been brought in on a tray annie had waited nervously for rain to bring up the subject of her missing brother but he had proceeded to after the first consultation annie had begun to look forward to these quiet serene interludes during the time she was safely secluded here in rain s study drinking his exotic aromatic
d like to know what made me like i am in every aspect until i was seven years old i was the happiest child on the planet my parents and sister and i lived next door to two houses filled with cousins and aunts and uncles and a couple of sets of grandparents it was heaven i was the ringleader of the bunch ordering everyone about telling them what to do and how to do it my creativity was truly appreciated well maybe not appreciated by everyone there was the time i saw my grandmother twist the head off a chicken so i told my cousin we ought to help nana and twist the heads off all the chickens there we were no more than five years old chickens tucked between our scraped knees and twisting and twisting and twisting my grandmother came out of the house with a load of wash and there were all her chickens their heads cocked to one side listing drunkenly about the yard temper of my grandmother i do nt know how my cousin and i escaped alive but those wonderful years ended soon enough when my mother decided she d had enough of her mother in law s renowned temper my mother who could defeat any temper with her rock hard stubbornness on one fateful day informed my father that she had bought a piece of land and he was going to build her a house on it in my parents household we all liked to pretend that my father was the one who made the rules i think the rule he made was give mama what she wants or she ll make life hell for all of us whatever his thoughts he was nt fool enough to say no to my mother when she had that look in her eye whatever the philosophy behind it the result was the same we moved in that one day i lost all those cousins and grandparents i lost the chickens and the cows and the possum that lived in a barrel in chiggers and i lost apple trees to climb in one day i went from being the champion of all a person of prime importance to being the toolong in a matter of hours i went from having the most exciting life in the world to having a life of supreme dullness my mother and sister were cut out of the same cloth they were good good good good what is more boring than good my mother was always saying do nt eat too much chocolate it ll make you sick or i ca nt look at that right now i have too much work to do or hayden you can not read that book now you have nt finished cleaning the bathroom on and on she went there was a right time and a wrong time for everything but as far as i could tell the right time for exuberance never came did nt people ever want to do something that was nt on world who actually wanted to eat as much chocolate as i could hold and damn the consequences looking back i think that some people are afraid to break out of the rules maybe they re afraid that if they break the rules they ll lose all self control and become something horrible in my mother s case that would be a woman with a dirty bathroom floor whatever was behind it all again the result was the same i was put in a bubble of isolation and left there alone i had to try to remember to sit up straight walk sedately and never never be rambunctious i tried but it s difficult to control yourself when you re a child i guess an awful lot of me slipped out because i heard the phrase you know how you are a few million times sometimes i got the feeling that my parents thought that if they did nt keep me under rigid control every minute of every day that i d lose it altogether just plain never stop maybe they feared not being able to reel me back in if they just let me go ahead and be myself now that i m an adult and know all about adult things uh huh sure i know that my parents were not creative and i was if they bought something that needed assembly they read the box and put it together in the way the manufacturer wanted them to if i bought something i felt that reading the instructions was cheating and if i could nt put it together easily it was quite ordinary for me to jump up and down on the box and say all the dirty words i knew which thankfully were nt many my punishment for box jumping or any infraction of the peace rules was to be talked to for my own good never in my life have i understood that phrase when someone says this is for your own good it always always always means that someone is power so anyway how did i survive these spirit killers how did i survive being dragged to the preacher so he could talk to me because i was different how did i survive hearing my mother ask my relatives if they had any idea what she could do with me i did the best i could by escaping into a land of stories i read incessantly when my mother made me vacuum the bedroom i shared with my sister she was more concerned with the length of time i spent vacuuming than with how clean the floor was after i was finished all she ever checked was to see that the light bulbs were spotless so i learned to clean the bulbs then i d get in the closet with a book a flashlight and the vacuum and sit down for a forty five minute read
beady eyes glittered with malice heh heh heh elias examined the bird with interest i sense some hostility here he always acts like that charity made a face he knows it irritates me and after all i ve done for him too you d think that bird would show some gratitude otis cackled again i took him in after hayden died you know charity explained he was extremely depressed moped around let his feathers go lost his appetite it was terrible he was in such bad shape i was afraid to leave him alone during the day he sat on the coatrack in my back room office i kept his cage in my bedroom at night i m sure he s grateful elias bird that bird does nt know the meaning of the word crazy otis sidled along the tree limb muttering with evil glee you do nt know how lucky you were otis charity said no one else on the pier was willing to take charge of you more than a couple of people suggested that we try to sell you to some unsuspecting tourist and one individual who shall go unnamed wanted to call the pound and have you taken away but i was too softhearted to allow that i gave you shelter food free rides on yappy s carousel what did i get in return nothing but nasty complaints heh heh heh otis flapped his clipped wings take it easy otis elias reached out with one long fingered hand and scratched the bird s head an obligation exists until it is repaid you owe her crazy otis grumbled but he stopped chortling contented stupor as elias stroked his feathers amazing charity said the only other person that bird ever treated as an equal was hayden stone everyone else is just so much old newspaper beneath crazy otis s grubby claws otis and i had a long talk after newlin brought him over here yesterday elias said he and i have decided that we can share this shop together that s a relief to tell you the truth when i sent newlin down here with that nasty beast i expected you to refuse to take him in all fairness crazy otis is nt your responsibility just because you took over charms virtues does nt mean you have to take charge of him elias gave her a long considering look otis was nt your responsibility either but you took him in and gave him a home for the past two months there was nt much else i could do hayden was even if he was a little weird the fact that you liked hayden did nt mean that you had to take care of otis unfortunately it did charity sighed somehow crazy otis has always seemed like one of the family here on the pier a particularly unpleasant relative i admit one i d prefer to keep stashed out of sight in the attic but nevertheless a relation and you know what they say about your relations you ca nt choose them you have to take what you get i understand elias stopped rubbing otis s head and picked up the teapot again you do nt have to keep him you know charity said in a burst of rash honesty he s not a very lovable bird as you said he s family parrots like otis have long life spans you ll be saddled with him for years cheered by the fact that elias was not going to change his mind on the subject otis is settled now about this situation with far seas yes all of the rents on the pier are due to be renegotiated before the end of september today is the fourth of august we ve got to act quickly just what action do you plan to take elias set down the teapot as i said we want to approach far seas as a united front charity realized with a start that she was staring at his hands they were very interesting hands powerful hands imbued with a striking utterly masculine grace a united front elias watched her as she hurriedly raised her gaze from his hands to his face right united she noticed that his eyes were the color of the sea during a storm a bleak steel gray her fingers clenched around the clipboard to lock in long term leases at reasonable rents before the corporation realizes what s happening here in whispering waters cove what is happening here elias s mouth curved faintly aside from the impending arrival of our visitors from outer space i see you ve already met some of the voyagers it s a little hard to miss them on the street true charity shrugged they re quite an embarrassment to the town council most of the members think the voyagers give whispering waters cove a bad image but like the mayor says one way or another the cult should be gone by the middle of august what happens then have nt you heard charity grinned gwendolyn pitt the leader of the group has told her followers that the alien spaceships will arrive at midnight on the fifteenth to take them all away on an extended tour of the galaxy during said tour everyone and philosophical enlightenment i ve been told it s difficult to mix the two yeah well evidently the aliens have mastered the problem as you can imagine the town council is hoping that when nothing happens that night the voyagers will figure out that the whole thing is a hoax and will leave whispering waters cove bright and early on the morning of the sixteenth in my experience people tend to cling to a belief even when they are confronted with clear evidence that it s false well it wo nt bother me or anyone else here on the pier if some of them decide to stay in the area charity admitted most of the

man chico capitan john paul osbourne was his name but his friends called him hay pee bernardo took only coke with his peanuts so esteban did the same though he felt entitled to drink whatever he

urus he d be able to pay them back and there d still be four months to go then he d be able to sign on for a whole other year provided his capitan was happy enough with his work the best years of my life muchacho no major port on earth apparently where bernardo had nt walked with the long loping steps and sinewy smile of a lighthearted and elegant officers saloon waiter but he had nt been to sea in eighteen years not since clara his second wife clarita was only twenty nine when she died he said of tetanus horrible she was german on her papi s side chavalo and he was left with three little

nine comandantes the way they did those terrorists on that hijacked plane at the airport in africa bernardo looked directly at esteban the forced vehemence of his expression contradicted by the clouded softness of viejo looked away his tios always talked like that if not quite as screwily what was it to him what viejos thought except chocho why did they always seem to think he needed to hear strong opinions and that he must be full of strong opinions about the same things they always had strong opinions about seething he barely listened while bernardo chattered on about his years working as a chauffeur in managua the families he d driven for including one related to the petrocelis bernardo had nt touched the lunch that had been served in the middle of his life story esteban had glumly passed up wine again but now the viejito punctured the wrapping of his crackers with his plastic fork carefully peeled yellow wax from his tablet of cheese and cut the cheese into thin slivers which

the shadow of a crow at the first gesture of morning flies began stirring inman s eyes and the long wound at his neck drew them and the sound of their wings and the touch of their feet were soon more potent than a yardful of roosters in rousing a man to wake so he came to yet one more day in the hospital ward he flapped the flies away with his hands and looked across the foot of his bed to an open triple hung window ordinarily he could see to the red road and the oak tree and the low brick wall and beyond them to a sweep of fields and flat piney woods that stretched to the western horizon the view was a long one for the flatlands the hospital having been built on the only swell within eyeshot but it was too early yet for a vista the window might as well have been painted grey had it not been too dim inman would have read to pass the time until breakfast of settling his mind but he had burned up the last of his own candles reading to bring sleep the night before and lamp oil was too scarce to be striking the hospital s lights for mere diversion so he rose and dressed and sat in a ladderback chair putting the gloomy room of beds and their broken occupants behind him he flapped again at the flies and looked out the window at the first smear of foggy dawn and waited for the world to begin shaping up outside the window was tall as a door and he had imagined many times that it would open onto some other place and let him walk through and be there during his first weeks in the hospital he had been hardly able to move his head and all that kept his mind occupied had been watching out the window and picturing the old green places he recollected from home childhood places the damp creek bank where indian pipes grew the corner of a meadow favored by brown and black caterpillars in the and from which he often watched his father driving cows down to the barn at dusk they would pass underneath him and then he would close his eyes and listen as the cupping sound of their hooves in the dirt grew fainter and fainter until it vanished into the calls of katydids and peepers the window apparently wanted only to take his thoughts back which was fine with him for he had seen the metal face of the age and had been so stunned by it that when he thought into the future all he could vision was a world from which everything he counted important had been banished or had willingly fled by now he had stared at the window all through a late summer so hot and wet that the air both day and night felt like breathing through a dishrag so damp it caused fresh sheets to sour under him and tiny black mushrooms to grow overnight from the limp pages of the book on his bedside table inman suspected that after such long examination the grey window that morning though it surprised him for it brought to mind a lost memory of sitting in school a similar tall window beside him framing a scene of pastures and low green ridges terracing up to the vast hump of cold mountain it was september the hayfield beyond the beaten dirt of the school playground stood pant waist high and the heads of grasses were turning yellow from need of cutting the teacher was a round little man hairless and pink of face he owned but one rusty black suit of clothes and a pair of old overlarge dress boots that curled up at the toes and were so worn down that the heels were wedgelike he stood at the front of the room rocking on the points he talked at length through the morning about history teaching the older students of grand wars fought in ancient england after a time of actively not listening the young inman had taken his hat from under the desk and held it by its brim he flipped his wrist an updraft and soared it landed far out across the playground at the edge of the hayfield and rested there black as the shadow of a crow squatted on the ground the teacher saw what inman had done and told him to go get it and to come back and take his whipping the man had a big paddleboard with holes augured in it and he liked to use it inman never did know what seized him at that moment but he stepped out the door and set the hat on his head at a dapper rake and walked away never to return the memory passed on as the light from the window rose toward day the man in the bed next to inman s sat and drew his crutches to him as he did every morning the man went to the window and spit repeatedly and with great effort until his clogged lungs were clear he ran a comb through his black hair which hung lank below his jaw and was cut square around he tucked put on his spectacles of smoked glass which he wore even in the dim of morning his eyes apparently too weak for the wannest form of light then still in his nightshirt he went to his table and began working at a pile of papers he seldom spoke more than a word or two at a time and inman had learned little more of him than that his name was balis and that before the war he had been to school at chapel hill where he had attempted to master greek all his waking time was now spent trying to render ancient scribble from a fat little book into plain
the folks of gil antitoi son of a canadian history professor from urbana to events like the central illinois open in decatur a town built and owned by the a e staley processing concern and so awash in the stink of roasting corn that kids would play with bandannas tied over their mouths and noses like the western closed qualifier on the isu campus in normal like the mcdonald s junior open in the serious corn town of galesburg way out west by the river like the prairie state open in pekin insurance hub and home of caterpillar tractor like the midwest junior clay courts at a chichi private club in peoria s pale version of scarsdale over the next four summers i got to see way more of the state than is normal or healthy albeit most of this seeing was a blur of travel and crops looking between nod outs at sunrises abrupt and terribly candent over the crease between fields and sky plus you could it came around the earth s curve and the only part of proust that really moved me in college was the early description of the kid s geometric relation to the distant church spire at combray riding in station wagons backseats through saturday dawns and sunday sunsets i got steadily better antitoi unfairly assisted by an early puberty got radically better by the time we were fourteen gil antitoi and i were the central illinois cream of our age bracket usually seeded one and two at area tournaments able to beat all but a couple of even the kids from the chicago suburbs who together with a contingent from grosse pointe mi usually dominated the western regional rankings that summer the best fourteen year old in the nation was a chicago kid bruce brescia whose penchant for floppy white tennis hats low socks with bunnytails at the heel and lurid pastel sweater vests testified to proclivities that would nt dawn on me for several more years but brescia and his henchman anything but the midwestern clays and some indoor events in cook county being too busy jetting off to like the pacific hardcourts in ventura and junior wimbledon and all that i played brescia just once in the quarters of an indoor thing at the rosemont horizon in and the results were not pretty antitoi actually got a set off mees in the national qualifiers one year neither brescia nor mees ever turned pro i do nt know what happened to either of them after eighteen antitoi and i ranged over the exact same competitive territory he was my friend and foe and bane though i d started playing two years before he he was bigger quicker and basically better than i by about age thirteen and i was soon losing to him in the finals of just about every tournament i played so different were our appearances and approaches and general gestalts that we had something of an epic rivalry from through i had gotten so prescient at using stats of stoic cheer that i was regarded as a kind of physical savant a medicine boy of wind and heat and could play just forever sending back moonballs baroque with spin antitoi uncomplicated from the get go hit the everliving shit out of every round object that came within his ambit aiming always for one of two backcourt corners he was a slugger i was a slug when he was on i e having a good day he varnished the court with me when he was nt at his best and the countless hours i and david saboe from bloomington and kirk riehagen and steve cassil of danville spent in meditation and seminar on just what variables of diet sleep romance car ride and even sock color factored into the equation of antitoi s mood and level day to day he and i had great matches real marathon wind suckers of eleven finals we played in i won two midwest junior tennis was also my initiation into true about my taoistic ability to control via noncontrol i d established a private religion of wind i even liked to bike awfully few people in philo bike for obvious wind reasons but i d found a way to sort of tack back and forth against a stiff current holding some wide book out at my side at about degrees to my angle of thrust bayne and pugh s the art of the engineer and cheiro s language of the hand proved to be the best airfoils so that through imagination and verve and stoic cheer i could not just neutralize but use an in your face gale for biking similarly by thirteen i d found a way not just to accommodate but to employ the heavy summer winds in matches no longer just mooning the ball down the center to allow plenty of margin for error and swerve i was now able to use the currents kind of the way a pitcher uses spit i could hit curves way out into cross breezes that d drop the ball just fair i had a oval in the air and curved left to right like a smart slider and then reversed its arc on the bounce i d developed the same sort of autonomic feel for what the wind would do to the ball that a standard trans driver has for how to shift as a junior tennis player i was for a time a citizen of the concrete physical world in a way the other boys were nt i felt and i felt betrayed at around fourteen when so many of these single minded flailing boys became abruptly mannish and tall with sudden sprays of hair on their thighs and wisps on their lips and ropy arteries on their forearms my fifteenth summer kids i d been beating easily the year before all of a sudden seemed overpowering i lost in two semifinals at
block the music but blurred and softened it absorbing it deep within the wall on the morning of tian s recital i woke up alone as i lay in bed listening to his swooping dizzying warm up scales i suddenly felt our narrow room pitch up and down like a ship on a swell i tumbled out of bed and staggered to the bathroom where i bent down and seized the toilet waiting there until i was sick as i knelt against the cold floor and vomited again i understood that tian and i would have a child it seemed to me that some spiritual power had focused upon me that i knelt before a tablet of our ancestors i wanted to meditate burn incense as a sign of thanks to them and as a caution against any harm that might come a moment later i found myself in the hallway breathing hard my hand on the knob of the door to tian s little room the music stopped cautiously i turned the knob but he had not heard he re tuned his instrument and impatiently began his piece again perhaps it would not be wise to share my news so close to his recital after all we had not planned for this i tiptoed away that evening we had a light dinner and left early we boarded the subway sitting side by side as if we were brother and sister i stretched my legs in front of me to make him notice my new shoes but he did not notice i stared at the soft black shoes myself as we lurched along in the empty car the steel car roared and rushed we held tian s violin case over our laps he clutched the canvas cover tightly the fluorescent lights cast bruised shadows on his high sallow cheekbones and but i felt as if i were encased in a bubble of happiness and illness i did not want to ruin his concentration i folded my gloved trembling hands over the violin case i had dressed protectively in a hat a scarf and a long wool coat we arrived early to an almost empty recital hall far to the left by himself sat an older man with a thick head of gray hair and a big mustache this tian whispered was professor spaeth his former teacher and now his dean every now and then someone would come up and chat with spaeth for a minute or two but his responses were brief and none of the visitors stayed for long tian vanished into a door next to the stage i sat alone in the third row too shy to turn around and watch the students and colleagues who came in groups of twos or threes and scattered themselves among the seats they spoke fluently as carelessly to their english and knew that i would not be able to hold my own in any conversation i could only make out a few words including teacher china curious before i came to this country i felt at home in the chinese language the way a fish feels at home in the sea when i came to new york i vowed to practice speaking english but it was difficult working in the restaurant i did not talk to customers i did not own a television i took classes at a community college but made little progress with the humped and tangled grammar instead i spent my spare time reading novels i bought and traded with the other waitresses books that had seduced me with their bright familiar covers lined up along the shelves in the chinatown stores now as i sat alone i was overtaken by fear i longed to be back home in brooklyn curled up in tian s big the lights dimmed and tian took the stage with john o neill his accompanist and officemate i had never met john although tian often spoke about him and i was surprised by his height his reddish beard the audience gave a generous welcome the clapping died down the two men bowed then took their places tian in front of the piano his bow struck the strings it seemed to drop from above the way a hawk will plunge with sudden swiftness to its victim tian bent and swayed in the vivid light dark and wild and foreign altogether unfamiliar a vein in his right jaw which i had only briefly noticed rippled and stood out it was like watching a man have a seizure he terrified me his music shuddered through me with a violence i am not sure i can describe now delicate and now enormous but always more powerful than his swaying fragile figure on the stage i felt as if he had achieved these sounds myself pulling away from him my back pressed tight against the chair how could i have chosen such an unforgiving man i knew nothing about music but i could hear in these sounds a man who would accept no excuse from anyone or anything close to him the violin uncaged from the practice room filled the recital hall with a clear intensity each note attacked the air quick and piercing as a dagger i fought an urge to run from the auditorium finally he stopped there came a prolonged and steady storm of applause i kept my wet hands tightly folded tian looked straight at me and smiled reappearing from this monstrousness then i did applaud he raised the violin and began his next piece afterwards we stood next to a bowl of orange punch tian spoke to the people who crowded us sometimes he made an introduction min this is jennings he and i share a practice locker i nodded and smiled they assured me so i nodded and smiled again sometimes i turned to tian for a translation but he seemed to be having problems with his english he stumbled over certain
the week i ll just use the phone there he said and call strathbane and then i ll take a look around detective chief inspector blair when contacted said he was busy on a drugs job but would send his sidekick jimmy anderson over with a forensic team hamish examined the hotel office apart from the gaping hole in the back of the safe there was no other sign of a break in that he could see you discovered this in the on here last night there was a ceilidh how many people about a hundred or so but the office was locked hamish examined the office door it was wooden with a frosted glass panel the lock was a simple yale one easily picked the barman and the waiter were brought in hamish questioned them closely they had nt finished their duties until one in the morning and then had gone straight to bed the barman johnny king was a sinister looking man in his thirties with his hair worn in a ponytail and his thin face marred by a long scar peter sampson the waiter was a small smooth faced youth of about twenty after he had finished interviewing them hamish walked around the public rooms of the hotel it was typical of the more depressing type of highland hotel everything in pine and plastic and with the once gaudy carpets looking as if they badly needed shampooing tartan curtains hung at the windows shields along with bad murals of depressing historical events like the battle of culloden and the massacre of glencoe the artist had not liked bonnie prince charlie for there he was with a cowardly look on his white face fleeing the battle of culloden and he had nt liked the campbells either witness their savage and gleeful faces as they massacred the macdonalds of glencoe what s the polis doing here demanded a shrill voice behind him he swung round a small blonde middle aged woman stood glaring at him her hair was wound around a forest of pink plastic rollers and a cigarette hung from thin lips painted orange beside her stood a tall sulky girl in micro skirt and black suede thigh boots fringed suede jacket and purple blouse her makeup was dead white her lipstick purple and her black hair gelled into spikes mrs macbean aye what s it to you the safe in the office was broken into last night mrs macbean it s gone all gone said hamish cool said darleen her eyes were flat and dead valium or sheer bovine stupidity thought hamish where is he demanded mrs macbean in the office said hamish and then turned away as he heard cars driving up outside he went out to meet the contingent from strathbane detective jimmy anderson s foxy features lit up in a grin when he saw hamish if it isnae mr death hisself he said cheerfully where s the body wi the great hamish macbeth on the scene there s bound to be a body no body the safe s been broken into like i told you i figure someone from the hotel did it aye maybe hamish but what makes you think that i chust have this feeling the seer of lochdubh jeered jimmy of them opening up that bar you shouldnae be

up that horrible uniform your trousers are so shiny i can see ma face in them are we going to investigate this snapped hamish or are we going to stand here all day trading insults where s the body then said jimmy with a sigh if you mean the safe it s in the office afore you go in jimmy is there any gossip about macbean not that i ve heard somat enterprises a glasgow company who owns this place employed him two years ago the food s rotten and the drinks are suspect but they come for the bingo hamish it s not as if sutherland is a swinging place no competition oh well lead the way macbean was standing outside the office in the entrance hall through the open office door the white coated forensic team were busy dusting everything for fingerprints damn muttered hamish two of the men turned the safe around their fingerprints will be on it i ll tell them said jimmy you stupid fool mrs macbean suddenly shouted in her husband s face one pink roller shaken loose by her rage fell onto the carpet i tellt ye that safe was silly but you had tae go and dae things on the cheap shut your face growled macbean and go and do something to yourself you look a right fright with them curlers in hamish s tooth gave a sinister twinge wait a bit mrs macbean he said you went what s gilchrist like she looked at him in amazement it wisnae me it was darleen that had the toothache hamish turned questioningly to darleen who was slumped against the wall studying her long purple fingernails darleen she suddenly opened her mouth and pointed to the bottom front row of her teeth where there was a gap he pulled your tooth too right could nt he have saved it whit fur because teeth can be saved these days darleen stifled a yawn no shit sherlock whit the hell are you asking questions about some poxy dentist when you re supposed to be finding out who burgled my safe howled macbean i m working on something else said hamish jimmy anderson came out of the office okay i ll take you one at a time there s no need for you any mair papers or whatever exciting things you usually do in lochdubh hamish went reluctantly there was an odd
argued emma was her sister and her major source of gossip know what else she says julia dean got a postcard mother jane pleaded well it s fact dotty argued earl saw the postcard and told eliot since he s the one has to keep peace here and family being upset can she s here the postcard was from her daughter in des moines who said that it was a shame that julia was isolating herself and that she understood how upset she had been by daddy s death that they all were but three years of mourning should be enough so when was she coming home all that on a postcard bree asked she did nt know much more about julia than that she had opened a small flower store three years before and twice weekly arranged sprigs in the diner s vases she came by for an occasional meal but kept to herself she struck bree as shy but sweet certainly not the type to deserve being the butt of gossip julia s family does nt know about earl jane muttered really bree glanced toward the window when a bright light swelled there another eighteen wheeler pulling into the parking lot and then dotty said with a glance of her own at that saw another ufo eliot says the lights were from a truck but she insists there s a mark on the back of her car where that mother ship tailed her leeann leaned closer did she see the baby ships again the squiggly little pods i did nt ask dotty shuddered that woman s odd bree had always found verity more amusing than odd and would have said as much now if flash had nt called twenty two s up leeann bree stayed leeann with a touch i ll get it she topped off dotty s coffee and returned the carafes to their heaters scooping up the chicken piccata with angel hair that was ready and waiting she headed down the counter toward the booths twenty two was the last in the row tucked in the comer by the jukebox a lone man sat there just as he had from time to time in the last seven months he never said much like now he was reading a book his name was tom gates he had bought the hubbard place a shingle sided bungalow on west elm that had nt seen a stitch of improvement in all the years that the hubbards health had been in decline since tom gates had taken possession missing shingles had been replaced shutters had been straightened the porch had been painted the lawn cut what had happened inside was more murky skipper boone had rewired the place and the wrights had installed a new furnace but beyond that no one knew and bree had asked she had always loved the hubbard place though smaller than her victorian it had ten times the charm she might have bought it herself if she d had the nerve but she had inherited her own house from her father who had inherited it from his millers had lived on south forest for too many years to count and too many to move so she contented herself with the bungalow on west elm none of those bits came from tom gates he was nt sociable good looking very good looking too good looking to be alone but not sociable here you go bree said when he moved his book aside she slid the plate in she wiped her palms on the back of her jeans and pushed her hands in the pockets there reading anything good his eyes shifted from his dinner back to the book it s okay she tipped her head to see the title but the whole front looked to be typed weird cover it has nt been published yet really how d you get it i know someone the author when he shook his head the diner s light shimmered in hair that was shiny light brown and a mite too long are you a reviewer she asked he shifted then she decided not that he looked scholarly he was too tanned too tall too broad in the shoulders coming and going he strode flash bet that he was a politician who had lost a dirty election and fled dotty bet he was a burned out businessman because earl told of mail from new york leeann bet he was an adventurer recouping after a tiring trek bree could see him as an adventurer he had that rugged look his buying a house in town did nt mean much even adventurers needed to rest sometimes but they did nt stay put for long panama bored men who loved risk this one would be gone before long it was a shame because tom gates had great hands he had long lean blunt tipped fingers and moved them in a way that suggested they could do most anything they tried bree had never once seen dirt under his nails which set him apart from most of the men who calluses those men did his hands looked well used he had cut himself several months back and had needed stitches the scar was nearly two inches long and starting to fade i just finished the new dean koontz she said have you read it yet he was studying his fork no it s pretty good worth a shot can i get you anything else another beer she hitched her chin toward the longneck on the far side of his plate you know that s local do nt you sleepy creek pale it s brewed down the street his eyes met hers they were wonderfully gray yes he said i do know she might have been lured by those eyes to say something else had not the front door opened just then to a flurry of flakes and the stamping boots of four truckers shaking snow
a whole month s rent there was a rush to his voice a desperation i m not sure i said i was caught off guard but i did nt want to say no immediately and hurt him reject him i think we d get along fine and you only have to try it for a week he said we can even make it per diem nine no eight dollars a day i ll do it i blurted out suddenly i ll give it a try what moments before had been out of the question w as now the path i had leaped upon i changed my life without a moment s because he wanted me i was responding to that i was flattered i wanted to be wanted this will be very good for you he said and he sounded happy there s much i can teach you about new york you know i can advance you socially his voice was confident again regal that would be very nice of you i said my heart was pounding i think we both felt giddy his wanting me and my accepting of his wanting had both of us rejoicing i gushed to him perhaps revealing too much it s really very strange that i ll be moving to new york it s all because i was looking at the cover of henry james s washington square and i thought i should be in new york i ca nt stand james he proclaimed he s unreadable i know what you mean i was worried that i up for myself and james a little bit by saying but the earlier books are quite good like daisy miller or washington square yes that s true his style did change i wonder why he burned himself you know sat on a stove and shriveled his testicles that may account for the change in style he laughed and i laughed with him but it was hard to know what to expect from him the issue of sex was unclear i was nt sure if he was heterosexual homosexual or if he was some kind of bawdy puritan but this uncertainty did nt bother me i found it intriguing and familiar i told him that i would need a little time to tie things up in princeton and that i d move in as close to the first of september as possible this was suitable to him and we rang off lt i did nt give my park place landlord sufficient notice but he returned hastily but i felt drawn to new york and to henry harrison it was my perception that mr harrison was a gentleman and that i was a fledgling gentleman and so we would be well suited for one another i had been acting like a novice gentleman for almost six years it started in my sophomore year at rutgers when i began to address myself in my thoughts as the young gentleman and i think its precise beginning was after i read w somerset maugham s the razor s edge and evelyn waugh s brideshead revisited in too close a succession then there followed fitzgerald and wodehouse and wilde and mann and i came to only want to read books about young gentlemen for me they were like don quixote s books of chivalry i tried to live as the young gentlemen lived i wrote thank you notes and i enjoyed train travel i shaved daily ate solitary meals and dressed neatly i used the authors themselves as models i attempted to dress like wore sneakers favored pants with texture linen wool or corduroy and went to italian barbers for short haircuts so i developed a style a manner of living it was a fantasy that i wore like armor to get me through the day and to enjoy the day it made loneliness feel like a movie a typical saturday in princeton sounded like this in my mind the young gentleman strolls up nassau street he wears his blue blazer he goes to his favorite restaurant the annex for his luncheon he sits at his bachelor table and reads the paper while he eats he is kindly to the anc ient waitresses for his digestion the young gentleman strolls some more he stops at micawber s bookstore greets the hardworking proprietor and browses he is one of the legions who browse and rarely buy but the proprietorappreciates the young gentleman his dignified manner his wearing of a tie the young gentleman walks to palmer square and sits and desire his company the young gentleman smiles but remains aloof he watches the packs of young girls get ice cream at thomas sweet s he sniffs the air as they walk past him hoping to catch a hint of young perspiration helooks at their sugary mouths their thin legs and arms their ice cream cones he wants to run home and hide in bed he s nothing but an onanist unfortunately i was always dissolving into overly lonesome thoughts which turned sexual out of desperation but that sample day illustrates very well the young gentleman s life the idea was to establish a routine routines were romantic young and old gentlemen had them you went about your routines quietly but people took notice and admired you i wanted them to be able to count on me appearing at the annex on saturdays it was like being a force of nature a robin redbreast who returns to the same tree every spring a young gentleman in a blue that i had done a good tour of duty in princeton people did nt know me but they would miss me and now i wanted to go live with henry harrison he was a fellow gentleman he wanted to advance me socially i did nt really think he could advance me but the fact that he said such a thing inspired me i had been living as
find every reason to mention it in front of the women who look at eva the men who stare at jiri to discern what secret quality can make a member of the opposite sex behave so shamelessly the sweet unlikely promise of february in prague now traffic stalls in a stagnant pool of exhaust that makes landau s eyes burn outside the window a roadside stand sells huge stuffed animals plush neon pink panthers with black button noses sucking up pollution landau nudges his seatmate a depressed albanian novelist the albanian glances over and nods and emits a tragic snort even in the august heat the albanian wears a scratchy brown cardigan a muffler of the same fabric bandages his throat at the welcome cocktail party the whole congress overheard jiri complimenting the albanian s outfit recalling how in the camps he d worn every scrap of scrounged clothing if you slipped into something more comfortable everything else you owned was stolen the albanian had made the same melancholy snort with which he s just responded to landau and what is jiri wearing an expensive pale blue silk shirt with the top buttons undone revealing a freckled chest thatched with white hair and even to go to the camp he changed his mind ten times erasing and rewriting his name until he dug a hole in the sign up sheet he hates to think of the holocaust or rather he feels it too deeply unlike all those slobs who take dates to schindler s list so they can provide a manly shoulder for their girls to burrow their faces in during the scene in which the naked female prisoners do nt know if the shower will spray water or poison gas is nt there something by definition obscene about guided tours of hellexcept of course if you re dante yet plenty of people visit the camp for as many different reasons at the last minute landau decided to go to shut up and take his medicine maybe it would do him good just as working with children was supposed to be good for felice and it is nt as if he s making a special effort going out of his way to satisfy a ghoulish curiosity the whole kafka perfectly normal landau will probably feel left out if he does nt go also he d hate to look like a coward who ca nt even visit the camp where jiri spent three hellish years which is another reason not to go the camp is jiri s kingdom they turn a corner and there it is a solid brick fortress not unlike the state colleges built after the vietnam war after students like landau ran around smashing windows and there is the sign over the gate arbeit macht frei work makes you free oh the fabulous ironies of the german sense of humor and how amazing how incredible that you can see it from a tour bus which for the first time since they left prague hits a reasonable speed and zips past the camp then past parking lots crammed with dusty cars campers and fully loaded german made rvs the passengers murmur anxiously could they have missed their stop wait this bus was hired to take them calming hand the bus is just going to parkmiles away from the camp how will the frail israeli rabbi manage the long hike back but first they must drive past another tourist attraction eva kaprova points out the national memorial cemetery the tidy straight rows of pale identical markers over which the state has recently erected a monumental gleaming silver cross the passengers fall silent and gaze dully at the cross then something startling happens jiri lopes to the front of the bus he turns to mug at his colleagues and with broad clownish gestures spreads his arms out wide as if he is hanging on the cross but he does nt look like jesus jiri s in much better shape a condor about to flap its wings and fly up through the bus ceiling the conferees gaze at him worshipfully why did landau come here he d told himself it would be worth it for the free ticket to prague and let s be honest he was flattered that he d been somehow crossed the ocean the bus squeezes into a parking space its passengers do nt notice they go on staring at jiri until he collapses his arms and laughs the moment s over they too can laugh and be released to stand and gather their things and follow jiri off the bus and up the road to the camp the kafka congress flocks around eva kaprova who collects them on the drawbridge and invites them to look down at the moat that the nazi engineers designed so they could flood it in an emergency with water from the nearby river landau stares down into the weedy moat which is dry of course and littered with paper broken glass eastern european landscaping the parching sun sears the back of his neck he lifts his head too quickly and tiny black spots swim before his eyes oh god what if he faints here kafka s castle says eva with a bitter actressy chuckle but no one s paying attention gone ahead of them and is heading into the camp what is it like for jiri to walk up that cobblestone road and under that soot blackened stone arch could this be the first time since landau ca nt help wondering but jiri s beyond cheap psychology or sentimental melodrama he enters the camp like its owner a hero or messenger storming the fortress with urgent news for the king the kafka congress ditches poor eva and rushes ducklinglike up the path scurrying after mr pied piper even the elderly rabbi lifts his cuffs and hurries landau lingers watching eva s generous sullen mouth droop even lower as she shades her eyes with
let me kill him cara said her boot strikes sounding like rawhide mallets hammering the polished marble floor the supple leather boots kahlan wore beneath her elegant white confessor s dress whispered against the cold stone as she tried to keep pace without letting her legs break into a run no cara exhibited no response keeping her blue eyes ahead to the wide corridor stretching into the distance a dozen leather and chain mail clad d haran soldiers their unadorned swords sheathed or crescent bladed battle axes hooked on belt hangers crossed at an intersection just ahead though their weapons were nt drawn every wooden hilt was gripped in a ready fist as vigilant eyes scrutinized the shadows among the doorways and columns to each side their hasty bows toward kahlan only briefly interrupted their attention to their task we ca nt just kill him kahlan explained we need answers an eyebrow lifted over one icy blue eye oh i did nt say he would answer any question you have when i m finished with him a mirthless smile ghosted across her flawless face that is the job of a mord sith getting people to answer questions she paused as the smile returned to widen with professional satisfaction before they die kahlan heaved a sigh cara that s no longer your job your life your job now is to protect richard that is why you should let me kill him we should not take a risk by letting this man live no we first have to find out what s going on and we re not going to start out doing it the way you want cara s smile humorless as it was had vanished again as you wish mother confessor kahlan wondered how the woman had managed to change into her skintight red leather outfit so fast whenever there was so much as a whiff of trouble at least one of the three mord sith red as they often pointed out did nt show blood are you sure he said that this man those were his words yes mother confessor his exact words you should let me kill him before he has a chance to try to bring them to pass kahlan ignored the repeated request as they hurried on down the hall where s richard you wish me to get lord rahl no i just want to know where he is in case there s trouble i would say that this qualifies as trouble you said that there must be two hundred soldiers holding weapons on him how much trouble can one man cause with all those swords axes and arrows pointed at him my former master darken rahl knew that steel alone could not always ward danger that is why he had mord sith nearby and at the ready that evil man were really a danger to him richard is nt like that and neither am i you know that if there is a true threat i m not shy about eliminating it but if this man is more than he seems then why is he so timidly cowering before all that steel besides as a confessor i am hardly defenseless against threats that steel wo nt stop we have to keep our heads let s not start leaping to judgments that may be unwarranted if you do nt think he could be trouble then why am i nearly running to just keep up with you kahlan realized that she was a half a step ahead of the woman she slowed her pace to a brisk walk because it s richard we re talking about she said in a near whisper cara smirked you re as worried as i of course i am but for all we know killing this man if he is you could be right but that is the purpose for mord sith so where is richard cara gripped the red leather at her wrist and stretched her armor backed glove tighter onto her hand as she flexed her fist her agiel an awesome weapon that appeared to be nothing more than a finger width foot long red leather rod dangled from a fine gold chain at her right wrist ever at the ready one just like it but no weapon in kahlan s hands hung on a chain around kahlan s neck it had been a gift from richard a gift that symbolized the pain and sacrifice they had both endured he is out behind the palace in one of the private parks cara gestured over her shoulder the one that way raina and berdine are with him kahlan was relieved to hear that the other two mord sith were watching over him something to do with his surprise for me what told you cara cara snatched a glimpse out of the corner of her eye of course he has told me then what is it he also told me not to tell you kahlan shrugged i wo nt tell him that you told me cara s laugh like her smile before bore no humor lord rahl has a peculiar way of finding out things especially those things you wish him not to know kahlan knew the truth of that so what s he doing out there the muscles in cara s jaw flexed outdoor things you know lord rahl he likes to do outdoor things kahlan glanced over to see that cara s face had turned nearly as red as her leather outfit what sort of outdoor things cara cleared her throat into her armored fist he is taming chipmunks he s what i ca nt hear you said that the chipmunks have come out to test the warming weather he is taming them her cheeks rounded as she huffed with seeds kahlan smiled at the thought of richard the man she loved the man who had seized command of d hara and had much of the midlands now eating out of
lover for almost two years marcus he laughed low thats far longer than anyone has lasted since at the expression on marcus face he raised a tell me you parted with her amicably arria was still beautiful still intent on gaining the adoration of every male in the room still amoral and eager for any new excitement however marcus saw subtle changes the soft loveliness of youth had given way to a harder edged worldliness her laughter held no exuberance or pleasure rather it carried a quality of brashness and crudity that grated several men hovered around her and she alternately teased each making jokes at their expense and offering whispered suggestive observations she glanced across the room then looking at marcus in question he knew she was wondering why he had nt been caught by the smile she had cast him when he came in but he knew that smile for what it was bait for a hungry fish unfortunately for arria marcus was not hungry not any longer antigonus leaned closer see how she looks at you marcus you could have her back with a snap of your fingers the man conquest metrodorus crateuas merula what he lacks in wit he more than makes up for in money he s almost as rich as you are but then our little arria has money of her own these days her book created quite a furor book marcus said and gave a sardonic laugh i did nt know arria could write her name let alone string enough words together to make a sentence obviously you know nothing of what she s written or you would nt be making light of it its hardly a laughing matter our little arria had secret talents unbeknownst to us she s become a woman of letters or more precisely erotica a do all tell all collection of stories by the gods its stirred up trouble in high places one senator lost his wife over it not that he minded the loss of the woman but her family connections cost him dearly rumor has it he may be forced into suicide arria i think she s addicted to scandal she has scribes working night and day making copies of her little tome the price for one copy is exorbitant which you undoubtedly paid marcus said dryly but of course antigonus said with a laugh i wanted to see if she would mention me she did in chapter eleven to my dismay it was a rather cursory mention he glanced at marcus with an amused smile she wrote about you in detailand at length no wonder sarapais was so enamored of you at the games the other day she wanted to see if you were all arria said you were he grinned you should buy a copy for yourself and read it marcus it might bring back a few sweet memories for all her exquisite beauty arria is crass and best forgotten a rather cruel assessment of a woman you once loved is nt it antigonus marcus turned his attention to the dancing girls undulating before him the bells on their ankles and wrists jingled grating on his nerves rather than be aroused by the boldness of their sensual dance and transparently veiled bodies he felt discomfited he wished their performance would end and they would depart antigonus reached out to grasp one of the women and pulled her down onto his lap despite her struggling he kissed her passionately when he drew back he laughed and said to marcus pick one for yourself the slave girl cried out and the sound sent marcus insides instinctively recoiling he had seen the look on the girls face before in hadassah s eyes when he had let his own passions burn out of control let her go antigonus others were watching antigonus laughing and calling out encouragement drunk and provoked antigonus became rougher in his determination to have his way the girl screamed marcus found himself on his feet let her staring at marcus in astonishment laughing antigonus raised his head and looked at him in mild surprise his laughter died alarmed he rolled to one side releasing the girl weeping hysterically she stumbled to her feet and scrambled away antigonus regarded marcus quizzically my apologies marcus if you wanted her that badly why did nt you say so earlier marcus felt arrias eyes fixed on him like hot coals burning with jealousy he wondered fleetingly what punishment the slave girl would receive at arrias hands for something that had nothing to do with her i did nt want the girl he said tersely nor any other in this room whispers rippled several women glanced at arria and smirked antigonus countenance darkened then why intrude upon my pleasure you were about to rape the girl antigonus laughed dryly rape given another moment she would have enjoyed it i doubt that the insult since when did a slaves feelings matter to you i ve seen you take your pleasure in like ways a time or two i do nt need to be reminded marcus said grimly downing the remainder of the wine in his cup what i do need is a breath of fresh air he went out into the gardens but found no relief there for arria followed him merula at her side gritting his teeth marcus bore their presence she talked about their love affair as though it had ended yesterday and not four years before merula glared at marcus who felt pity for the man arria had always enjoyed tormenting her lovers have you read my book marcus she said her voice dripping honey no its quite good you d enjoy it i ve lost my taste for trash he said his gaze flickering over her her eyes flashed her face contorted with rage you were the worst lover i ever had marcus grinned back at her coldly thats because im the only one who walked
flies with no wings run and jump off their hind legs only to land on their faces i have splattered flies and decapitated them to splatter a fly in one straight shot i have discovered is nt nearly as entertaining as breaking it down bit by bit wing by leg by head since the first day i was escorted to my quarters i have sent three hundred twenty three flies down the incineration chute to the fire i have killed flies on every wall under my bed in the shower and the sink i have even splattered one directly on the lens of a surveillance camera i have of collecting them i would like to label and pin them to rows of styrofoam and catalogue them in wooden drawers of course i would never be allowed but i do relish the idea i ca nt help but wonder whether if i had any concrete memories of the past i would be fascinated with such things but the fact of the matter is that i do nt i do nt know why this is or why it has to be i have asked i have asked and i have been ignored and have been dealt with so i stopped asking after some time now among other things i chase flies when i am away from my duties when the dizziness from my injection passes i wash my hands and my face with surgical scrub then change my shoes and my uniform i send the smock mask and rubber gloves down the incinerator chute and continue toward the interoffice elevator bank in order to gather supplies for the midnight movie more than nine minutes and thirty seconds should an attendant think of taking half steps or shortcuts through this procedure he can be demoted up to percent against his debt the current yield on his debt will appreciate x months later than current appreciation date number of months are determined by the level of the infraction the regulation of half steps and shortcuts applies to all procedures for which all staff members are responsible it is known as the liability doctrine in short if any half step or shortcut is taken through any procedure we are liable for our lack of thoroughness and or attention to detail even when such thoroughness and or attention to detail is dependent on another staff member this dependency on other staff members makes for interdependence every week since i have been poppy s ward i have been suffering from a lack of interdependence i have been demoted once a week for as long as i can remember because poppy s exterminator has never appeared in poppy s chambers to perform considered a full step i half the step he the other half my efforts can not be completed in full according to my contract i am to escort the exterminator through the corridors into the bathrooms and through poppy s living quarters every third thursday of the month at exactly p m i am to wait in one of the three corridors leading to poppy s chambers i am to wait until either poppy calls for me or until i am supposed to be somewhere else not once has the exterminator shown up and not once have i heard of an investigation into the exterminator i do not understand why there has nt been any investigation especially since poppy has seen on more than several occasions a small beetle crawling in and out of the various ravines of his chambers landscape when i tell poppy that the exterminator has been neglecting his duties he tells me about the communist diaspora and the nature of the mongol hordes of the thirteenth century khan led on a fortress in bukhara in the region of central asia he will condemn the mongols in both the chinese and russian governments blame them for these regimes obstinacy throughout the centuries when he is through with his discourse i ask him what should be done he says he does nt want me to do anything in fact he warns me that i am not to speak about such things until he himself sees the insect with his own eyes and when this occurs i am not supposed to contact the exterminator but rather am expected to chase after the bug capture it and send it down the incinerator but every time he has seen this beetle i have nt i tell him so regardless i am sent off to attack this invisible creature dig for it with my fingers through the refuse of headlines and history tear away words upon his commands i destroy the mountain range as i know it rearrange it the land of all its precious qualities he points me in this direction and that direction until he tires from the chase and i m left panting and sweating and have newsprint and paper cuts covering my hands i discovered early on that poppy is deathly afraid to be in the same room with another s blood which i find confusing because he is so exacting when describing the details of medieval weaponry and how with the proper amount of brute force a thick and heavy sword cuts through skin and crushes bone whereupon a man is a pulsing corpse on the several occasions i have bled in his presence he has informed celia lonesome head of domestic staff to send a cleaning crew to disinfect his chambers during this time he remains in bed as the workmen clean around him spraying heavy doses of ammonia onto the newspapers and into the air dressed in smocks masks and rubber gloves the crew disinfects and scours until they have depleted most of the chambers calms him of his terror and mind you his terror is quite real i have learned that he has many fears like this and if one wished to torment him it would be a very simple
first grandchild and old enough to be my father my grandfather took me to meet him at the dock in port of spain the ship that brought him hull painted in big bold black letters was the name of our recently crowned queen queen elizabeth ii at the time i shared the awe my teachers had for her the sun never sets on british soil this young queen had the responsibility for us all and the arrival of a ship named after her was an occasion for much pomp and circumstance hundreds of people thronged the dock that day pressing against the wooden barriers that separated them from the ship s passengers the police brass hand comic to me then as it was now played military marches in praise of our queen the musicians looked like costumed players at carnival chocolate faces melting under stiff white cardboard helmets white plumes fanning on top of brass spikes brass buttoned white jackets heavy navy pants black leather shoes crimping flat feet but they were not players at carnival the uniforms they wore paid homage to the queen and to a system of government of which we were proud down the steps from the hands of the ship s crew on the top deck to the left of the ship s steps i saw my cousin standing defiantly alone his legs firmly planted apart in one hand a spear and in the other an underwater spear gun he reminded me of an african warrior though the only ones i had seen at my age then were in my schoolbooks and they wore grass skirts and carried no guns of any kind long after my memories of the excitement on the dock that day dimmed the image of the spear and gun remained with me as clear as the sparkling waters that cascaded over the rocks in blue basin for my cousin who had caused jaws to drop in disbelief when with the accuracy of a seagull plunging its beak into a darting fish he dove from the highest rock into that tiny pond we called blue basin let that spear and gun distract him under the water in maracas bay when he floated to the surface again blood was pouring from night the kind of bottomless yawning grief that can find nothing upon which to anchor itself that stretches itself out into a long howl ending in a hollow silence i heard men cry that night my father his five brothers my grandfather my cousin s friend his two brothers the sounds they made were different from the muffled sniffles of the women the men bellowed loudly in impotent rage lashing out at a young man who so missed his warm tropical sea on that damp cold island we called the mother country that one night was all he could wait before he took his spear gun with him and dove deep deep into the sky blue water they found no water in his lungs only blood streaming down his face from veins in his head that had ruptured under the pressure of the sea still his fingers were locked around his spear gun his knuckles turned grisly white he must have thought he was a fish the damn who the hell would dive down in the middle of the sea with no oxygen who the hell did he think he was a damn fish the blue basin champion blue basin s no sea dammit the fool my uncle railed against my cousin s folly his pride his ignorance his bullheadedness he hurled blame at his dead son until he exhausted himself and only grief remained releasing tears that poured without restraint down his cheeks my grandmother remained in stony silence not a word of consolation not a tear in sympathy finally my youngest uncle melvyn gathered up the courage to explain he was with my cousin when he died we had a warning he began cautiously i told him so i told him what warning my grandmother s voice soft but firm stopped melvyn in midsentence go on tell me talk a big black fish like a giant boat was out at sea i saw it break through the water it looked my uncle melvyn paused go on my grandmother urged him gently like a woman maybe it was his words alone that stoked his brother s fading anger or the way he mumbled them under his breath as though ashamed for thinking them begging some retribution that would have proven his thoughts wrong but they revived my uncle and he flew into a rage again stop it stop it not your goddamn stories and lies but my grandmother did not stop like a woman she repeated dreamily melvyn s eyes darted nervously from her to his brother with arms like a woman she asked short stunted but like a woman my dead cousin s father stared at my grandmother in disbelief his lower lip shaking but he did not dare cross her he unleashed his fury on melvyn instead you stupid fool this is what you have to say when my son is dead the orehu said my grandmother my dead cousin s father held his tongue and let her speak the mermaid the orehu she called your son home later when he chose to forget that his brother had said he saw a fish like a woman in the sea and that his mother had named it orehu and claimed it had called his son home my uncle asked melvyn to tell his story again he would listen to his tale about a big fish like a dolphin alan had laughed at him melvyn said when he told him he had seen a big black fish with fins like arms rise vertically from the sea i laughed at myself too no fish has arms my uncle was satisfied not like a woman he was reassured then what happened he asked
st paul thursday evening it was a raw gusty november night the last time jeffrey chapel walked up the broad sweep of steps to the st paul cathedral entering through the side door he passed into the vestibule the two appointments that awaited him in minneapolis weighed heavily on his mind to stay focused to bolster his flagging courage he needed a few minutes of quiet reflection and that s why he d come the cathedral had become a refuge of late a place of retreat when he needed time alone jeffrey had never been much of a churchgoer before his mother died she d written to him calling him a lukewarm catholic a mighty condemnation coming from her pious lips during his many years in the military he d never attended church regularly he had nt been to confession in years and yet with all the chaos surrounding him now he d found a kind of peace within the walls of this magnificent nothing it was the atmosphere inside the sanctuary that affected him so deeply perhaps he reasoned it was a holdover from his childhood a time when the catholic god he d been taught about was safely on his throne and his own life made sense black and white creeds were made for children the curse of adult life was to see those clear cut blacks and whites dissolve into millions of shades of gray jeffrey realized that most of the people in this building believed passionately in their image of god and though he found their certainty bewildering the feel of the place still appealed to him especially since his own life had suffered terribly from a lack of personal conviction none of this would have been enough to placate his mother of course but in a strange way jeffrey needed to be here he needed the tiny flickering candles the hushed voices echoing through the cavernous interior the scent of polished wood and the perfume of incense but most importantly he quiet that got inside his soul and stayed there he hoped to find strength here tonight because for what he had to do he d need every ounce of strength he could muster entering the nave through one of the rear doors he saw that a few parishioners were still sitting in the pews perhaps leftovers from the early evening mass directly to his left was an alcove that held mary s shrine breathing in the serene atmosphere he walked up to the votive candles and lit one saying a silent prayer then kneeling before the statue he gazed up into mary s youthful face true to form the artist had created a child not a womana sweet girl who could accept simple answers without question jeffrey would have felt more secure confiding in a face that looked as if it had lived a little one where innocence had been worn away by the hard realities of life and yet he d come here tonight for help he might as folded his hands and pressed them to his forehead he quickly became so lost in his own thoughts that he did nt hear the footsteps behind him until a soft voice called colonel chapel jeffrey turned to find a short portly man with a neatly clipped gray beard leaning over him it was father latimer one of the priests i m sorry to interrupt you said the priest apologetically but i have nt seen you here in weeks i ve been concerned i m leaving in a few minutes and i was hoping we might talk jeffrey did nt feel like having a conversation just then but since he owed this particular priest a great deal he got up and followed him to one of the back pews he d been planning to call father latimer to thank him for the information he d passed along almost two months ago but with everything in his life caving in around him he d put it off did you see her was she able to help jeffrey looked down at the wedding band on his left hand father latimer had officiated at his marriage five years ago yes he said pressing his lips together and looking up at the altar i saw her and it s not good news the priest gave a deep sigh sitting back in the pew i was afraid of that listen father i ve done a lot of thinking in the past month i m going to ask my wife for a divorce tonight she deserves much better than me the priest looked shocked should nt she be the judge of that no and i want to take it a step further once the divorce is final i want the church to grant us an annulment brenna must be able to marry again as much as he needed to protect knew he could nt the best he could do was cut her loosegive her a second chanceand hope like hell that one day she could forgive him but the sacrament was celebrated you took vows it s not as simple as you might think colonel please i m retired from the military you promised to call me jeffrey yes right but you you consummated the marriage yes you ve slept together of course that s not an issue but it is i mean latimer paused then looked off into space jeffrey felt a moment of intense guilt for the pathetic lies he d told the man during their last meeting at the time he had seen no other way returning his attention to jeffrey the priest seemed very sad god loves you my son if you want to talk further thanksbut no thanks you say you re she does nt know she knows something s been wrong for a long time she just does nt know what and your father in law he s part of the problem i see he
never mind she was part of some other world a world she no longer liked and now she was somewhere else another world she no longer liked but she was willing willing to give it a whirl once in a while children about having children about turning kith to kin how did he feel about all that it seemed to her that if she were ever going to have a life of children and lawn mowers and grass clippings it would be best to have it with someone who was not demeaned or trivialized by discussions of them did he like those big fertilized lawns how about a nice rock garden how did he feel deep down about those combination storm windows with the built in screens yeah i like them all right he said and she would nod slyly and drink a little too much she would try then not to think too strenuously about her whole life she would try to live life one day at a time like an alcoholic drink do nt drink drink perhaps she should take drugs i always thought someday i would have a little girl and name her after my grandmother sidra sighed peered wistfully into her sherry what his paisley mouth grandma her name was grandma walter laughed in a honking sort of way oh thank you murmured sidra thank you for laughing walter had a subscription to autoweek he flipped through it in bed he also liked to read repair manuals for new cars particularly the toyotas he knew a lot about control panels light up panels side panels you re so obviously wrong for each other said charlotte over tapas at a tapas bar hey please said sidra i think my taste s a little subtler than that the thing with tapas bars was that you just kept stuffing things into your mouth obviously wrong is just the beginning that s where i always begin at obviously wrong in theory she liked the idea of mismatched couples the wrangling and retangling like a comedy by shakespeare i ca nt imagine you with someone like had met him only once but she had heard of him from a girlfriend of hers he had slept around she d said into the pudding is how she phrased it and there were some boring stories just do nt let him humiliate you do nt mistake a lack of sophistication for sweetness she added i m supposed to wait around for someone special while every other girl in this town gets to have a life i do nt know sidra it was true men could be with whomever they pleased but women had to date better kinder richer and bright bright bright or else people got embarrassed it suggested sexual things i m a very average person she said desperately somehow detecting that charlotte already knew that knew the deep dark wildly obvious secret of that and how it made sidra slightly pathetic unseemly inferior when you got right down caught in the stare of a deer guns do nt kill people thought sidra fizzily deer kill people maybe it s that we all used to envy you so much charlotte said a little bitterly you were so talented you got all the lead parts in the plays you were everyone s dream of what they wanted sidra poked around at the appetizer in front of her gardening it like a patch of land she was unequal to anyone s wistfulness she had made too little of her life its loneliness shamed her like a crime envy said sidra that s a lot like hate is nt it but charlotte did nt say anything probably she wanted sidra to change the subject sidra stuffed her mouth full of feta cheese and onions and looked up well all i can say is i m glad to be back a piece of feta dropped from her lips know what you mean she said she opened her mouth wide and let all the food inside fall out onto the table charlotte could be funny like that sidra had forgotten that about her walter had found some of her old movies in the video rental place she had a key she went over one night and discovered him asleep in front of recluse with roommate it was about a woman named rose who rarely went out because when she did she was afraid of people they seemed like alien life forms soulless joyless speaking asyntactically rose quickly became loosened from reality walter had it freeze framed at the funny part where rose phones the psych ward to have them come take her away but they refuse she lay down next to him and tried to sleep too but began to cry a little he stirred what s wrong he asked nothing you fell asleep watching me i was tired let me kiss you let me find your panels his eyes were closed she could be anybody did you like the beginning part of the movie this need in her was new frightening it made her hair curl when had she ever needed so much it was okay he said so what is this guy a race car driver asked tommy no he s a mechanic ugh quit him like a music lesson like a music lesson what is this similes from the middle class one man s opinion she was irritated sidra this is not right you need to go out with someone really smart for a change i ve been out with smart i ve been out with someone who had two ph d s we spent all of our time in bed with the light on proofreading his vita ever done every little little little i mean have you ever seen a vita tommy sighed too he had heard this story of sidra s before yes he said i thought patti lupone was great besides she

the emperor paused to let masako reach his side she flashed him a grin a very un japanese gesture but then she had spent years in the united states attending college before their marriage he dearly enjoyed seeing her grin and leaned forward so that her lips brushed his cheek his smile broadened arm in arm they walked down the hall to the end then turned right four men stood silently waiting they blocked the hallway the emperor stopped one of the men moved noiselessly to position himself behind the royal couple but the others did not give way nor the emperor noted with surprise did they bow not even the tiniest bob naruhito looked from face to face not one of the men broke eye contact yes he said finally your wife may leave your excellency said one of the men his voice was strong even yet not loud who are you asked the emperor i am captain shunko kato of the japanese self defense force kato bowed deeply from the waist but none of the other men moved a muscle these enlisted men are under my command our own naruhito felt his wife s hand tighten on his arm he looked again from face to face waiting for them to look away as a gesture of respect none of them did why are you here the emperor asked finally he realized that time was on his side not theirs and he wished to draw this out as long as possible kato seemed to read his thoughts we are here for japan kato said crisply then added the empress must leave now naruhito could read the inevitable in their faces although the thought did not occur to captain kato naruhito had as much courage as any man there he turned toward the empress you must go dear wife she stared into his face panic stricken both her hands clutched his arm in a fierce grip he leaned toward her and whispered we have no choice go and know i love you the group looking directly into the eyes of each man three of them averted their gaze then she turned and walked back toward the lawn from a decorative table nearby kato took a samurai sword which the emperor had not previously noticed with one swift motion the officer withdrew the blade from the sheath for japan he said grasping the handle with both hands the sword was very old the emperor noticed hundreds of years old his heart was audibly pounding in his ears he looked again at each face they were fanatics resigned emperor naruhito sank to his knees he would not let them see him afraid thank heavens his hands were not trembling he closed his eyes and cleared his thoughts enough of these zealots he thought of his wife and his son and daughter the last thing he heard was the slick whisper of the blade whirring through the air masako walked slowly toward the door where just seconds ago step was torture agony the men were assassins masako in her horror had sensed it the moment she saw them they had no respect their faces registered extraordinary tension not like loyal subjects meeting their emperor and his wife but like assassins she knew her nation s history of course knew how assassins had plagued rulers and politicians in times of turmoil how they always murdered for japan as if their passionate patriotism could excuse the blood could excuse slashing the life from men who had little or no control over the events that fired the murderers then atoned for their crimes in orgies of ritual suicide the bloody melodrama was terrible theater yet most japanese loved it reveled in it were inspired by it ancient racial memories were renewed with flowing fresh red blood new sacrifices propitiated savage urges and mesmerized the audience patriotic murder was sadistic masako thought an obscene perversion that surfaced when the world pressed relentlessly in upon the japanese as it had in the s apparently was now she could scarcely place one foot in front of another oh naruhito beloved husband that we should have to face this and i should not be at your side she turned and hurried back toward her husband toward the evil that awaited them both she ran the length of her stride constrained by her skirt just before she reached the corner she heard the singing of the sword and then the sickening thunk as it bit into flesh she turned the corner in time to see her husband s head rolling along the floor and his upright torso toppling forward she saw no more despite her pain or perhaps because of it she passed out collapsed in a heap shunko kato did not look again at the emperor s corpse there was little time and staring at the body of a man who had failed japan would be wasting it he arranged a letter on the table where the sword had rested the letter was written in blood had all signed it for japan kato knelt and drew his knife he looked at his chief nco who was standing beside him his pistol in his hand banzai he said banzai kato stabbed the knife to the hilt in his own stomach the sergeant raised his pistol and shot kato in the back of the head blood and brains flew from the captain s head the sound of the shot made a stupendous thunderclap in the hallway in the silence that followed he could hear the tinny sound of the spent cartridge skittering across the floor air escaping from the captain s body made an audible sound but the sergeant was paying no attention he looked at his comrades they too had their pistols out brave men doing what had to be done the sergeant took a deep breath then raised the barrel of his pistol to his own head the others did
genre was the infamous eleanor of aquitaine eleanor was related to five count em different kings or pseudo kings during the twelfth century her father was the duke of aquitaine now known as gascony and since he controlled more land than the king of france he routinely signed official documents as the king of aquitaine in louis of france arranged a marriage between his son prince louis and princess eleanor eleanor was nt a good wife since she had what s politely known as a roving eye evidently it was more than her eye that roved her husband who soon became louis vii of france was a pious man and his wandering wife not only failed to produce an heir to his throne but also became notorious as an adulteress he finally managed to have their marriage annulled in and two months later eleanor married henry plantagenet duke of normandy who incidentally also happened to be king henry was not barren and she bore henry several sons aside from that henry and eleanor did nt really get along together so he took the easy way out and locked her up to keep her out of his hair after he died eleanor stirred up trouble between her sons richard the lionhearted and john the incompetent both of whom became kings of england they also locked mother away to keep her out of mischief thus eleanor spent a lot of her time locked up embroidery did nt thrill her too much so she read books books were very expensive in the twelfth century because they had to be copied by hand but eleanor did nt care she had money if not freedom so she could afford to pay assorted indigents with literary pretensions to write the kind of books she liked given eleanor s background it s understandable that she liked books about kings knights in shining armor pretty young fellows who played the lute and sang of love towers her literary tastes gave rise to troubadour poetry the courtly love tradition and whole libraries of interminable french romances that concentrated heavily on the matter of britain king arthur et al and the matter of france charlemagne and co now we jump forward three hundred years to the wars of the roses there was a certain knight named sir thomas malory probably from warwickshire who sided with the lancastrians when the yorkist faction gained the ascendancy sir thomas was clapped into prison he was not strictly speaking a political prisoner however he was in prison because he belonged there since it appears that he was a career criminal more than a political partisan there may have been some politics involved in the various charges leveled against him of course but the preponderance of evidence suggests that he was a sort of medieval jesse james leading a gang of outlaws on a rampage through southern england he was imprisoned for sedition cattle rustling horse theft the looting of monasteries jail breaking and not infrequently of rape sir thomas seems to have been a very bad boy he was still a nobleman however and a sometime member of parliament so he was able to persuade his jailors to let him visit a nearby library under guard of course sir thomas was quite proud of his facility in the french language and he whiled away the hours of his incarceration translating the endless french romances dealing with what else king arthur the end result was the work we now know as le morte d arthur a technological break through along about then ensured a wide distribution of malory s work william caxton had a printing press and he evidently grew tired of grinding out religious pamphlets so sensing a potential market he took malory s manuscript and edited it in preparation for a printing run i think we underestimate caxton s contribution to le morte d arthur if we can believe most scholars of disconnected tales and caxton organized them into a coherent whole giving us a story with a beginning a middle and an end now we jump forward another four hundred years queen victoria ascended the british throne at the age of seventeen queen victoria had opinions queen victoria did nt approve of naughty stuff queen victoria had a resident poet alfred lord tennyson and he cleaned up malory for his queen to produce a work he called idylls of the king idylls of the king is a fairly typical victorian bowdlerization that accepted the prevailing attitude of the time that le morte d arthur was little more than bold bawdry and open manslaughter it glossed over such picky little details as the fact that guinevere was an adulteress that king arthur did have an incestuous affair with his half sister morgan le fay and other improprieties another hundred years slip by and we come to papa tolkien who was probably even prissier than queen victoria have you ever noticed that lady hobbits and female hobbit puppies but no girls the victorians maintained the public fiction that females do nt exist below the neck contemporary fantasists all bow politely to lord tennyson and papa tolkien then step around them to go back to the original texts for inspiration and there are a lot of those texts we have king arthur and his gang in english we ve got siegfried and brunhild in german charlemagne and roland in french el cid in spanish sigurd the volsung in icelandic and assorted myghtiest knights on lyfe in a half dozen other cultures without shame we pillage medieval romance for all we re worth operating by trial and error mostly we ve evolved a tacitly agreed upon list of the elements that make for a good fantasy the first decision the aspiring fantasist must make is theological king arthur and charlemagne were christians siegfried and sigurd the volsung were pagans my personal view is that pagans write better stories when a writer is having fun christians let
to the person offending me i stopped speaking to my sister one time when she took up cigarettes and another time when she bleached her hair and this time possibly with so deep and vindictive a hurt that i would obstinately refuse to tell any of them the cause for that would be speaking my oldest friend in the world marvin winkler with whom as an infant i had often been lodged together in a playpen was amazed not long ago when i recalled the incident and related my stunned reaction he was puzzled by my surprise for he had been informed of the relationship by his mother when he was still a child and cautioned against hurting my feelings by bringing it up my sister too was taken aback to read my account of this event in a biographical piece about me for which she had also been interviewed she along with my mother and my brother had simply assumed she claimed that i d known all along it was not a scandal not even a secret they did nt talk about it because there was no need to on the other hand i know it is true at all to me about my father least of all about an earlier marriage until out of curiosity as an adult i began to inquire and only once did my mother talk to me about him volunteering the information that my father could eat a whole chocolate cake at a single sitting as a delivery driver for a wholesale bakery firm cakes were easy for him to obtain and that before he went into the hospital with a bleeding gastric ulcer his stool was as black as coal she told me this as an admonition against my own appetite for i could always eat as much cake as was given me and still want more i discovered early in life that shelled walnuts in a bowl of raisins make a lovely late evening treat for uninterrupted munching till bedtime i once overheard my mother recounting that when i was a nursing infant she had to tear me away from the breast for i would never finish and i can believe her different as each of us was from the we did nt want to talk about we were and functioned as a close family it was not in our nature to complain quarrel demand or gossip i remember a number of tantrums i discharged as a juvenile but i believe that from the time i was an adolescent i had acquired the family s stoic resigned and undemanding nature and did nt complain quarrel or gossip either my mother finding herself after six years of marriage a widow with three children two of them not naturally her own had brought us up as the mother of us all and my brother and sister had related to her as such my brother i learned had at one time saved up money enough to buy her a better radio the gift was poignantly apt for my mother loved melodic music puccini arias in particular and in those days of radio entertainment amid the glorious profusion of comedy and variety shows there was an other light classical pieces although the period was one of severe economic depression everybody sooner or later seemed able to find employment by the time i started school my brother fourteen years older than i was already working at a brokerage in wall street as a customer s man a job for which he was to prove ill suited by his modest manner and unaggressive temperament and by a disposition to be continually obliging to others my sister after graduating from high school and encountering a number of startling rebuffs at employment agencies would eventually find herself starting at r h macy s department store where she would remain for something like forty years and i at sixteen after classes at high school would be cutting a dashing figure in a khaki quasi military uniform as a part time messenger boy delivering telegrams for western union in office buildings in manhattan weekdays on a bicycle weekends to residences in brooklyn and mostly exulting in my duties with a sense of adventure and attentive curiosity of a dressmaker before her marriage worked steadily at home at her sewing machine mending garments for neighbors and doing alterations for a cousin sadie pacon who owned a dress shop on gravesend neck road in lower flatbush nearby she also found steady work at home from laundries turning frayed collars on men s shirts so that from the outside and at the neck at least the shirts looked almost good as new some weekend nights mainly saturdays my brother would find extra income filling in at a catering hall for some banquet dressing up appropriately for his suave role in the cloakroom or as one of the hall s hosts greeting and directing arriving guests neighbors outside the apartment building seeing him depart in a tuxedo or a natty double breasted summer sport jacket might remark that he was off on a heavy date but i knew he was going to work my mother liked to read in europe her family had been bookbinders from the coney island public library i would especially anna karenina with which she had long been familiar and thought dostoyevsky was crazy her brother my uncle sam late in life was employed repairing books for the library of brandeis university where his son harry stein a varsity player in james madison high school in brooklyn and city college in new york was one of the athletic coaches when my mother noticed an apple turning soft she would briskly plan a noodle pudding that made use of it rather than have it go to waste she took threadbare bedsheets to her scissors and her sewing machine and converted them into window curtains often as her eyesight weakened with age i would
the labels had to stand out you need the stickers to be easy to read at night and by somebody crying on drugs or drunk the stickers i use are just black on white with the black letters saying give yourself your life just one more chance call me for help then my phone number my second choice was if you re a young sexually irresponsible girl with a drinking problem get the help you need calland then my phone number take my word for it do nt make this second kind of sticker with this kind of sticker someone from the police will pay you a visit just from your phone number they can use a reverse directory and put your name on a list as a probable felon forever after that you ll hear the little click click click of a wiretap behind every telephone call you ever make take my word for it if you use calling to confess sins complain ask advice seek approval the girls you meet are never very far from their worst case scenario a harem of women will be clutching their telephones on the brink and asking you to call back please call back please call me a sexual predator but when i think of predators i think of lions tigers big cats sharks this is nt so much a predator versus prey relationship this is nt a scavenger a vulture or a laughing hyena versus a carcass this is nt a parasite versus a host we re all miserable together it s the opposite of a victimless crime what s most important is you need to put the stickers in public telephones try inside dirty phone booths near bridges over deep water put them next to taverns where people with no place to go get thrown out at closing time in no time at all you ll be in business you ll need one of those inside somewhere then people will call in crisis and hear you flush the toilet they ll hear the roar of the blender and know how you could nt care less these days what i need is one of those cordless telephone headsets a kind of walkman of human misery live or die sex or death this way you can make hands free life and death decisions every hour when people call to talk about their one terrible crime you give out penance you sentence people you give guys on the edge the phone numbers of girls in the same position the same as most prayers the bulk of what you hear is complaints and demands help me hear me lead me forgive me the phone is ringing again already the thin little coating of crumbs on the veal cutlet is almost impossible for me to get right and on the phone is a new girl crying i ask right away if she ll trust me i ask if she ll of us are just here swimming in one place the cutlet looks dug out of a cat box to calm this girl down to get her to listen i tell her the story about my fish this is fish number six hundred and forty one in a lifetime of goldfish my parents bought me the first one to teach me about loving and caring for another living breathing creature of god six hundred and forty fish later the only thing i know is everything you love will die the first time you meet that someone special you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground chapter three the night before i left home my big brother told me everything he knew about the outside world in the outside world he said women had the power to change the color of their hair and their eyes and their lips we were on the back porch in just the light from the kitchen window my brother adam was handfuls of it and cutting it with a straight razor at about the halfway point he d pinch my chin between his thumb and forefinger and force me to look at him straight on his brown eyes darting back and forth between each of my sideburns to get my sideburns even he d cut one then the other then the first over and over until both sideburns were gone my seven little brothers were sitting along the edges of the porch watching the darkness for all the evils adam described in the outside world he said people kept birds inside their houses he d seen it adam had been outside the church district colony just one time when he and his wife had to register their marriage to make it legal with the government in the outside world he said people were visited in their houses by spirits they called television spirits spoke to people through what they called the radio people used what they called a telephone because they hated alone he went on cutting my hair not for style as much as he was pruning it the way he d prune a tree around us on the porch boards the hair piled up not so much cut as harvested in the church district colony we hung bags of cut hair in the orchard to scare away deer adam told me the rule about not wasting anything is one of the blessings you give up when you leave the church colony the hardest blessing you give up is silence in the outside world he told me there was no real silence not the fake silence you get when you plug your ears so you hear nothing but your heart but real out of doors silence the week they were married he and biddy gleason rode in a bus from the church district colony escorted by a church elder the whole trip the bus was loud inside the automobiles on the road with them were

land erasmus thought how maps showed only two things land and water to someone who had nt traveled their journey over that turn right go north or south steer by this headland or that bay he and zeke who d pored over their predecessors accounts knew otherwise ice both fluid and solid appeared and disappeared with consistent inconsistency one year an inlet might be open the next walled shut lavinia unaware of this traced the route backward and said with satisfaction it s not so very far you ll be home before october expeditions have to winter over we ve provisioned for a full eighteen months in case we re frozen in with erasmus s book and then asked the question lavinia might have been framing in her mind i have nt understood this all spring she said if you take this route which you say concentrates most efficiently on the areas in which you have some evidence of franklin s presence how can you also search for signs of an open polar sea de haven and penny reported jones sound smoothed her paint stained garment ross found most of barrow strait frozen and peel sound as well even if you manage to approach the region of rae s discoveries which lies south of all those areas surely you ca nt also simultaneously head north worried him for months but he d pushed it aside zeke had nt mentioned his desire to find an open polar sea since the evening that had launched them all on this path lavinia s twenty sixth birthday party back in november alexandra had been present that night as well although erasmus had hardly noticed her he d been full of hope that lavinia was about to get what she most desired with greenery and lining the sills with candles scrubbing the dissecting table and shrouding it with crisp linen on which he d spread biscuits a roasted ham a turkey and a salmon in aspic lavinia had rejected her first three suitors too dull she d said too weak not smart enough while her out for zeke and somehow won him erasmus had been terrified for her during her long campaign then relieved then worried again his own fault zeke had asked for her hand but been vague about the details and erasmus had failed to press him his father would have known better he thought his father would nt have permitted lavinia to bind herself for an uncertain length of time the damage was done but secretly erasmus had hoped zeke might choose the party to announce a wedding date herself radiant in white silk trimmed with blue ribbons she stood perfectly still when zeke just as erasmus had hoped silenced the room and said i have an announcement looked confused zeke rested his elbow on a case that held a bird of paradise you ve all heard the news announced by john rae earlier this month he said he stood with his chin up his chest out one hand dancing in the air no doubt been the fate of franklin s expedition and my relief that some news however fragmentary and possibly incorrect has been obtained men the many rescue attempts the details of what rae had discovered old news to erasmus who d followed every newspaper article his guests listened glasses in hands among them women who would have listened with equal interest had zeke been reciting the agricultural products of china anything erasmus imagined them thinking for this chance to gaze at zeke blamelessly yet his own sister was the woman zeke had chosen perhaps you also feel as i do zeke added that now that the area has been defined someone has to search further for any possible survivors of lavinia s face she looked as puzzled as he felt backing of a number of our leading merchants for another expedition our valiant dr kane has been searching for franklin in the wrong area and although we re all worried about him and although i d be the first was nt already being organized something more is needed i propose to set forth this spring to search more thoroughly for franklin in the areas below lancaster sound while i m there i also propose to study the region and to further investigate the possibility of an open polar sea something like a smile hoping no one would notice his surprise what merchants when how did everyone know about this but him lavinia even who might have hidden her knowledge but she wore a smile as forced as his own zeke must have made these arrangements in secret taking pleasure in presenting his plan only when it was complete about where zeke might go and how he might get there and what sort of ship and crew he envisioned zeke took lavinia s hands she beamed as if his announcement were the ideal birthday present and when a guest sat down at the piano and began to play she and zeke led the crowd to the floor his still night air when zeke appeared with two glasses and a bottle he had to ask questions erasmus thought fatherly questions although that role still felt odd what this meant in terms of the engagement whether zeke wanted to marry lavinia before he left or release her perhaps until he returned the glasses and lit a cigar for himself erasmus opened his mouth to speak and zeke said erasmus you must come with me when are you going to get another chance like this expeditions he d already missed was this what he d been waiting for even elisha kent kane had spurned him sailing off with a crew of philadelphians younger but no smarter than himself perhaps zeke sensed his discouragement and the extent of his wounded vanity else as knowledgeable about the natural history of the polar regions or as familiar with the hardships of such a journey was preposterous
my brother s first serious girlfriend was eight years older twenty eight to his twenty her name was julia cathcart and henry introduced her to us in early june they drove from manhattan down to our cottage in loveladies on the new jersey shore when his little convertible his pet pulled into the driveway she was behind the wheel my mother and i were watching from the kitchen window i said he lets her drive his car my brother and his girlfriend were dressed alike baggy white shirts tucked into jeans except she had a black cashmere sweater over her shoulders she had dark eyes high cheekbones and beautiful skin pale with high coloring in her cheeks like a child with a fever her hair was back in a loose ponytail tied with a piece of lace and she wore tiny pearl earrings i thought maybe she d look older than henry but it was henry who looked older than henry standing grown a beard for starters and had on new wire rim sunglasses that made him appear more like a bon vivant than a philosophy major between colleges his hair was longer and not yet lightened by the sun it was the reddish brown color of an irish setter he gave me a kiss on the cheek as though he always had then he roughed around with our airedale atlas while his girlfriend and mother shook hands they were clasping fingertips ladylike smiling as though they were already fond of each other and just waiting for details to fill in why julia turned to me and said you must be janie most people call me jane now i said making myself sound even younger jane she said possibly in the manner of an adult trying to take a child seriously henry unpacked the car and loaded himself up with everything they d brought little bags and big ones a string tote and his girlfriend said do you have the wine hank whoever hank was he had it except for bedrooms and the screened in porch our house was just one big all purpose room and henry was giving her a jokey tour of it this is the living room he said gesturing to the sofa he paused gestured to it again and said this is the den out on the porch she stretched her legs in front of her audrey hepburn relaxing after dance class she wore navy espadrilles i noticed that henry had on penny loafers without socks and he d inserted a subway token in the slot where the penny belonged julia sipped her iced tea and asked how loveladies got its name we did nt know but henry said it was derived from the indian name of the founder julia smiled and asked my mother how long we d been coming here this is our first year tennis and without him present i felt free to add a subversive we used to go to nantucket nantucket is lovely julia said it is lovely my mother conceded but went on to cite drab points in new jersey s favor based on its proximity to our house in philadelphia in the last of our new jersey versus nantucket debates i d argued forcefully i d thought that camden was even closer i d almost added that the trash dump was practically in walking distance but my father had interrupted i could tell he was angry but he kept his voice even we could go to the shore all year round he said and that would help us to be a closer family not so far i said meaning to add levity but my father looked at me with his eyes narrowed like he was nt sure i was his daughter after all my mother smiled at water i d be able to walk right out the door and go swimming only then did i understand that they d already chosen a house they d put a bid on it it s on the ocean i asked close she said trying to maintain her enthusiasm the bay i said to myself it does have a spectacular view of the bay she said but no our house was on a lagoon a canal like venice she d said as though this would mean something to me now julia asked if we swam in there and my mother said absolutely i did nt want to acid rain on my mother s parade but the lagoon had oil floating on the surface and the bottom was sewagey soft i was surprised how long henry sat with us on the porch as my mother turned the topic to summer touching upon such controversial best mosquitoes pesky and tennis good exercise finally henry did get up he went outside as though on a mission he might be going to check my crab traps or to see if we d brought the bikes he could do whatever he wanted my father was the same way a houseful of guests and my mother s duty was to provide food drink fun and conversation while my father s was to nap or read while mother hostessed and girlfriend guested younger sister stood up when there was a pause in their nicing i made my mouth move smileward i d love to stay and talk but i have to go shoot some heroin now for dinner we had crabs i d caught off the dock my mother covered the table with newspaper and we all got print on our arms as a surprise she served preseason silver queen little nuggets of mush my typewriter style usually he d tap the cob at the end of a row and ding in response to my mother s questions julia told us about her brother in san francisco and sister in paris both of whom would be attending her mother s annual gala in southampton julia chose her words carefully and
join his friend michael he called as his brother was rushing out the entrance looked puzzled until ramsey nodded to the visitors michael immediately ran to the two men bowed to his waist and blurted out may i take your leave otis and brisbane gave their permission smiling as they watched the child bolt outside the boy resembles you laird brisbane commented t is the truth he s your very image for i well remember you as a lad god willing michael will also grow into a fine warrior a leader of men yes otis agreed with proper guidance he could become a great leader yet i could nt help but notice that the child fears his brother why is that laird ramsey was nt offended by the question as the old man spoke the truth and was simply making an observation i m a stranger to the boy but in time he ll learn to trust me and trust that you wo nt leave he answered realizing how perceptive the old man was i remember when your father decided to marry again brisbane remarked i thought alisdair was too old and set in his ways to take another wife your mother had been dead over ten years but he fooled me and he seemed very content did you ever meet glynnes his second wife i attended their wedding he said because she was so much younger than my father he was certain he would die first and he wanted to be sure she was well provided for he explained and he asked this of you otis inquired smiling i am his son ramsey responded i would do whatever he asked otis turned to his friend laird sinclair would never turn his back on anyone in need ramsey had wasted enough time talking about personal matters and turned the discussion back to the primary subject you not achieve this with a simple alliance your soldiers would have to patrol our borders night and day otis said and in time they would grow weary of the duty but if you owned the land yes brisbane eagerly agreed if the sinclairs owned the land you would protect it at all cost we have he suddenly stopped for he was so stunned by the fact that ramsey had moved forward to pour wine into their empty goblets he lost his train of thought you are laird yet you serve us as though you are our squire do you not know the power you hold ramsey smiled over their bewilderment i know that you are guests in my tent he answered and my elders it is therefore my duty to see to your comfort the men were honored by his words you have your father s heart otis praised his son the laird accepted the compliment with a nod and then gently led the men back to the topic he most wanted to discuss you were saying that i would protect your land at all costs if i owned it aye otis agreed and we have much to offer in return for this union our land is rich with resources our lakes are glutted with fat fish our soil is rich for planting and our hills are filled with sheep which is why we are being constantly attacked on all our borders by the campbells and the hamiltons and the boswells they all want our land our water and our women but the rest of us can go to hell ramsey did nt show any outward reaction to the passionate speech he began to pace about the tent with his head bowed and his hands clasped behind his back with your permission laird i would ask a few questions gideon his commander gideon turned to otis how many soldiers do you count among the macphersons nearly two hundred he answered but as brisbane explained they have not been properly trained and there are one hundred more of an age to begin training otis interjected you could make them invincible laird he said as invincible as laird brodick buchanan s spartans aye it s possible for they already have the minds and hearts of warriors you call brodick s soldiers spartans gideon asked smiling we do for that is what they are otis replied have nt you heard the stories about the spartans of times past from your fathers and grandfathers as we have gideon nodded most of the stories have been exaggerated nay most are true otis replied the stories were written down by the holy monks and retold countless added with a frown sinfully proud but extremely brave it was said they would rather die by the blade than lose an argument t is my opinion they were a stubborn lot we would nt want our soldiers to be as ruthless as the buchanan warriors brisbane hastily interjected ramsey laughed aye brodick s soldiers are ruthless his smile faded as he added know

than day and where he leads i will follow the room was dark except for several dim blue lights the largest of which flickered over a portrait of dr thorne with a halo presently eager little moans were heard from the cabinet followed by a high girlish voice hello it said hello called back one of dr thorne s friends that s his spirit control sunbeam explained a lady next to us my momma s here my poppa s here squeaked sunbeam and mr shakespeare is right beside me at this point your correspondent was hit in the face by a rose which sailed out of the cabinet we put it in our buttonhole i will count to three continued sunbeam and the cameramen will take pictures of ectoplasm sunbeam counted to three the opening the cameramen did nt get organized quickly enough and missed the picture the ectoplasm obligingly returned and waved again there was a slight pause more moaning and finally a deep bass voice thou hast asked for me and here i am it said i am mr william shakespeare shakespeare went on to say that he and bacon were one and the same person i want you to get that clear he told us and he seemed to mean it suddenly a thin white face with a white goatee appeared at the opening staying long enough to have its picture taken mr dunninger seemed unimpressed come out shakespeare said dunninger come in dunninger said shakespeare along with dunninger and a mr o neill of the herald tribune we went into the cabinet no bard no sunbeam only dr thorne in a black robe and a cold sweat give me air trance that seemed genuine to us he staggered from the cabinet and drank a coca cola dunninger said that he had seen a face but that he was nt a bit mystified i can produce an elephant from that cabinet he announced or three girls and julius caesar no one disputed him dr thorne looked disappointed when dunninger told him that he would nt get the money one of the women in the back said that shakespeare had red eyes and looked tired excuse me said dr thorne suddenly rushing across the room but you are stepping on my drawers september refugee reading literate intelligent refugees from the nazi dominated countries gravitate frequently to the public library when they come to live here and most of them talk over their problems with miss jennie m flexner an alert and kindly lady who has served as readers adviser there ever since the position was inaugurated eleven years ago miss flexner and her a bibliography of special reading drawn up for him in the case of the refugees of course the demand is always for books that will help the new citizen to understand the united states its language customs history and geography foreigners are more geography conscious than native americans for some reason in outlining courses of reading for refugees miss flexner tries to slip in literary antidotes for what she has discovered are the three great misconceptions about this nation that gangsters lurk on every hand making it dangerous to venture out after dark that political graft is rampant in every department of the government and that one must never discuss politics where there is any danger of being overheard the refugee newspaper is the times with no close second they read it patiently from beginning to end using a dictionary if necessary the epic of america and only yesterday are about tied for the non fiction honors other popular non fiction brown s body and the autobiography of lincoln steffens willa cather is the most popular novelist there is a steady demand among refugees for alice adams ruggles of red gap laughing boy so big hugh wynne and the scarlet letter people just beginning to explore our literature are tactfully steered away from fantasy social caricature and proletarian indignation on the theory that it would needlessly confuse or depress them there was hell to pay one time when a refugee got hold of robert nathan s one more spring which you may remember as a super delicate fantasy about the central park hooverville he brought it back and asked for a detective story in german instead what s going on in your parks he asked miss flexner europeans are fascinated by the american indian and take out all sorts of books on the subject both fact and fiction james fenimore libraries a great favorite in germany some of the refugees ca nt get used to the idea of an impartial unpropagandized library one german lady discovering on the shelves a copy of streicher s der sturmer ran out of the room with tears streaming down her cheeks one of the attendants caught up with her and convinced her that the public library had nt gone nazi it turns out that the american novelists who have been most popular abroad are lewis dos passos dreiser hemingway upton sinclair and joseph hergesheimer miss flexner is not convinced that this is all for the best whenever it is suggested to a refugee that he might find greater opportunities outside of new york he is likely to turn pale and murmur must i go to main street must i live in gopher prairie the library people try to explain that main street is the result of a tantrum which sinclair lewis got over years ago but it s uphill we want to be when we grow up is a tunneller in macy s to explain what a tunneller does we first have to describe macy s conveyor system by which packages are sent from the wrapping rooms on each floor to the loading platform in the basement where they are put into the delivery tracks the conveyors are spiral metal chutes about three feet high and two and a half wide they go round and round and down or
women children and pot bellied men were splashing around in the surf to my right was another hotel and then another each with its own crowded beach i took the restaurant was closed so i tried the bar it showed every sign of having been flown down intact from a catskill mountain resort i sat there for two hours drinking eating peanuts and staring out at the ocean there were roughly a dozen people in the place the men looked like sick mexicans with thin little mustaches and silk suits that glistened like plastic most of the women were americans a brittle looking lot none of them young all wearing sleeveless cocktail dresses that fit like rubber sacks i felt like something that had washed up on the beach my wrinkled cord coat was five years old and frayed at the neck my pants had no creases and although it had never occurred to me to wear a tie i was obviously out of place without one rather than seem like a pretender i gave up on rum and ordered a beer the bartender eyed me sullenly and i knew the reason why i was wearing nothing that glistened apple in order to make a go of it here i would have to get some dazzling clothes at six thirty i left the bar and walked outside it was getting dark and the big avenida looked cool and graceful on the other side were homes that once looked out on the beach now they looked out on hotels and most of them had retreated behind tall hedges and walls that cut them off from the street here and there i could see a patio or a screen porch where people sat beneath fans and drank rum somewhere up the street i heard bells the sleepy tinkling of brahms lullaby i walked a block or so trying to get the feel of the place and the bells kept coming closer soon an ice cream truck appeared moving slowly down the middle of the street on its roof was a giant popsicle flashing on and off with red neon explosions that lit up the whole area from somewhere in its bowels came the clanging of mr driver grinned happily and blew his horn i immediately hailed a cab telling the man to take me to the middle of town old san juan is an island connected to the mainland by several causeways we crossed on the one that comes in from condado dozens of puerto ricans stood along the rails fishing in the shallow lagoon and off to my right was a huge white shape beneath a neon sign that said carib hilton this i knew was the cornerstone of the boom conrad had come in like jesus and all the fish had followed before hilton there was nothing now the sky was the limit we passed a deserted stadium and soon we were on a boulevard that ran along a cliff on one side was the dark atlantic and on the other across the narrow city were thousands of colored lights on cruise ships tied up at the waterfront we turned off the boulevard and stopped at a place the driver said was plaza coln two bills he looked at the money and shook his head what s wrong i said he shrugged no change seor i felt in my pocket nothing but a nickel i knew he was lying but i did nt feel like taking the trouble to get a dollar changed you goddamn thief i said tossing the bills in his lap he shrugged again and drove off the plaza coln was a hub for several narrow streets the buildings were jammed together two and three stories high with balconies that hung out over the street the air was hot and a smell of sweat and garbage rode on the faint breeze a chatter of music and voices came from open windows the sidewalks were so narrow that it was an effort to stay out of the gutter and fruit vendors blocked the streets with wooden carts selling peeled oranges for a nickel each i walked for thirty minutes looking into peering into foul bars full of whores and sailors dodging people on the sidewalks thinking i would collapse at any moment if i did nt find a restaurant finally i gave up there seemed to be no restaurants in the old city the only thing i saw was called the new york diner and it was closed in desperation i hailed a cab and told him to take me to the daily news he stared at me the newspaper i shouted slamming the door as i got in ah s he murmured el diario s no goddamnit i said the daily news the american newspaper el news he had never heard of it so we drove back to plaza coln where i leaned out the window and asked a cop he did nt know either but finally a man came over from the bus stop and told us where it was we was no sign of a newspaper and i suspected he was bringing me down here to get rid of me we turned a corner and he suddenly hit his brakes just ahead of us was some kind of a gang fight a shouting mob trying to enter an old greenish building that looked like a warehouse go on i said to the driver we can get by he mumbled and shook his head i banged my fist on the back of the seat get going no move no pay he mumbled again but shifted into first and angled toward the far side of the street putting as much distance as possible between us and the fight he stopped as we came abreast of the building and i saw that it was a gang of about twenty puerto ricans attacking a tall american in a tan
i the air these nights though it is already november just shivers with mosquitoes and the stinkbugs sometimes late at night it sounds like a ping pong game those tough little shells tock tocking against the screens what you reckon i got in here they could want or need that s anyhow why i did nt get up right off and run to the door when the tapping started figured the bugs was just hankering after something again but when the screen door rattled i knew somebody had a mind to open it you stay right where you are i said i mean it leandra my name blew in from the porch on a breath of a breeze that had cooled down to just right for sleeping my heart knew right away who it was but the rest of me somehow refused the knowing i set down the scrap of doll s dress a bedragglement of loose lace hem got up i kept one step closer to the door what business you think you got here i said i was staring hard for some reason at the dolls lined up on the mourners bench its stern length taking up the wall between me and the porch the dolls come in earlier that week the afflicted the sick and the sorry waiting to be saved a pitiful sight the lot of them mostly stark naked and some in pieces one lady in a mildewed petticoat was holding her head in her lap i m grown right tired of trying to work miracles i thought leandra the whisper again door rattling it s me had better not be was all i could say and my hands were shaking then i heard the laugh knew it for wim s and with it like always came the end of any good sense i ever had i went and unlatched the screen but to hold open the door for a man could only be here because he intended to ruin my life and his april it was when i first went to massachusetts but it felt like winter to me i was twenty one years old and had never once been out of north carolina except up to norfolk and my mama gone but six months it might have calmed me down some had branch been there to carry me to the airport but branch was off at fort bragg that year and not available to be leaned on when miss maude ellen s nephew vern put me on that plane in norfolk i very nearly cried right out there in public i d never gone even so far as to picture myself on an airplane you make it back in one piece i ll maybe try it myself one day vern said i asked him did he want my ticket then and there i ai nt in no hurry he told me his was ten years ago now but i do nt guess i ll ever get over it where i flew to was boston and it still about strangles my heart to recollect how close that airplane come to landing on sheer water they ought to build airports in a place gives a little more seam allowance is what i think this man was sitting next to me wearing a brown suit and a spotty necktie i recall and he patted my knee when the plane bumped down and sighed with more relief than i myself was prepared to feel terra firma he said i nodded pleased i said a few minutes later the man helped me get mama s vanity case down from the curved bin above our seats and i said thank you kindly mr terrafirma and i never got the gist of his giddy smile not at all like a businessman until way later when my brother in law who is wim or was then terra firma is solid ground i know that now but it feels like something i have nt stood on since i was a child the yellow porch light i thought i shut off hours before made his olive skin look brassy it jaundiced his eyes and coated his teeth and tainted the streaks of white in his wiry hair the only thing that yellow bulb did nt do was keep the bugs away like it was meant to the chinch bugs bounced off the screen the mosquitoes and moths congregated around his face wim stood there in all that mess and stared in at me like i could save him just what do you think you re doing here i d like to know i said he nodded like he was agreeing i had every right to ask he looked like something the cat dragged in rode hard and put away wet through the mill to hell and back were other ideas that occurred to me but wim who teaches the boys are rich and no girls are allowed who once even wrote a book of poems printed in new york city when he was scarcely more than a boy himself and ca nt seem to get over it well wim is death on what he calls cliches and he s made it hard for me not to notice them and it seems like my mouth has never worked right since if you re disallowed to call a spade a spade what in the world are you supposed to call it so i just stood there gaping at him my mouth like a drain that was all clogged up with these words did nt have a thing wrong with them except they d been used a bit like something you d run across at a rummage sale on a lucky day another long minute went by then wim came to i guess because he slapped at a mosquito on his forehead and his hand came away bloody and a red blossom bloomed above his eyebrow
if the months of the year were put on parade in san antonio texas and a popular vote taken april would undoubtedly emerge as the hands down favorite april brings both the sweetest weather and the biggest parties of the year but this april felt more like june in the steadiness of its heat and on this particular april morning an unusual tension augmented the heat strangers in the normally friendly city were less likely to greet one another on the street instead there were wary sidelong glances and strollers downtown walked to their cars a little faster at the center of this uneasiness stood the bexar county justice center the criminal courthouse on the edge of downtown there the tension went undisguised protestors in front of the building carried signs occasionally one shouted angrily the protestors were dwarfed by the imposing five story stone building but employees in the building felt their presence guards at the entrance of the justice center watched the protestors with hands resting on gun butts an odor it emanated from a third floor courtroom the courtroom could nt accommodate everyone who had wanted to watch the trial in progress some of the people who had been turned away milled in the hallway waiting with the television cameramen and sometimes standing on tiptoes to try to get a glimpse through the glass doors of the court inside the courtroom spectators sat packed shoulder to shoulder the judge and the armed bailiffs had shushed the crowd more than once and no one spoke they strained to hear the witnesses and the lawyers but the mere breathing of so many people created a low background noise in the courtroom at the front of the courtroom the district attorney of bexar county chris sinclair shook his head and said no more questions your honor seconds later the judge s gavel banged down declaring a long lunch recess chris spoke briefly to his assistant then stood and turned toward the courtroom s exit he reached the gate in the railing two men looked at each other an alert newspaper photographer brought up his camera and snapped a photo of the two that would soon become famous the picture was brilliant in its contrasts chris sinclair the fresh steady district attorney who looked too young to have been a trial lawyer for almost fifteen years he had been elected district attorney only six months earlier a newspaper columnist had dubbed the christian sinclair campaign blond ambition and had gone on to say his name looks as good on the ballot as his face does on billboards chris had come out of nowhere as far as the public was concerned when he had announced his candidacy but he had surprised himself by being a good campaigner thoughtful and confidence inspiring but first as many lawyers in san antonio would ruefully acknowledge he was a damned good trial lawyer he had proven that again in one trial since his election but this current trial was very different the prosecution of malachi reese was being much larger shadows across the city major consequences waited to pounce on the outcome of the trial the defendant stood close to the district attorney at the gate in the railing older african american looking confidently but curiously into his persecutor s eyes and clearly many saw malachi reese as the persecuted as a black man being unjustly attacked by a white establishment for which christian sinclair served as the perfect poster boy after that one frozen moment malachi reese smiled cordially and held the gate open chris went through it and made his way through the crowd reese followed more slowly stopping to receive the encouragement of his supporters and to talk to the many reporters malachi reese had not come out of nowhere to be the center of attention at his own trial for the average citizen of san antonio reese fulfilled the definition of local celebrity he was well known for being well known people recognized him as having been a part of the fabric of public life for some years without being able to community groups and responsible for several successful political campaigns reese had never run for office himself mostly he moved in the background of committees and conferences but when he did step forward he drew attention when he served as a spokesman he exhibited the authority and confidence of a leader people nodded along as he spoke even in confrontation he retained his composure in the battlefields of emotion no one wielded logic more forcefully than malachi reese reese had brought those same skills to his trial for capital murder nearing fifty years old handsome and well groomed he looked distinguished in his dark gray suit the suit s subtle pattern seemed to compliment his dark brown skin old photos showed reese sporting an afro of impressive depth but those days were gone his black hair was of a medium cut now more curly than kinky and going sagely gray around his ears his small trim beard made him look christ like an invisible spotlight always seemed to be picking him out stopped to give a group interview to the cluster of reporters wearing an expression of sad bafflement reese looked like a strong man caught in a kafkaesque puzzle confronting lies so outrageous he could barely respond malachi reese s face was his vocation even while listening his face communicated his expression slid from concentration to concern to observation one never doubted that reese really heard the speaker he had thoughtful answers to every question until the questions ceased and his voice flowed on a river of gold people listening to that voice not only found it impossible to believe that reese had committed a brutal double murder they found it impossible even to hold the accusation in their minds ludicrous they thought one reporter trailed chris sinclair down the hall to ask the question chris had been asked repeatedly
and done the only surprise was that he had nt learned to talk better himself it was nt for lack of earnest effort but biology was against him and what with the configuration of muzzle teeth and tongue that fate had saddled a series of yaps and yawns and yowls a mooning muddled sort of discourse he was painfully aware of how far from fluency these noises fell but willy always let him have his say and in the end that was all that mattered mr bones was free to put in his two cents and whenever he did so his master would give him his full attention and to look at willy s face as he watched his friend struggle to make like a member of the human tribe you would have sworn that he was hanging on every word that gloomy sunday in baltimore however mr bones kept his mouth shut they were down to their last days together perhaps even their last hours and this was no time to indulge in long speeches and loopy contortions no time for the old shenanigans certain situations called for tact and discipline and in their present dire straits it would be far better to hold his tongue and behave like a good loyal dog without protest he did nt whine about not having eaten in the past thirty six hours he did nt sniff the air for female scents he did nt stop to pee on every lamppost and fire hydrant he simply ambled along beside willy following his master as they searched the empty avenues for calvert street mr bones had nothing against baltimore per se it smelled no worse than any other city they d camped in over the years but even though he understood the purpose of the trip it grieved him to think that a man could choose to spend his last moments on earth in a place he d never been to before a dog would never commit such a blunder he would make his peace with the world and then see to it that he gave up the ghost on familiar ground but willy still had two things to accomplish before he died and with characteristic stubbornness he d gotten it into his head that there was only one person who could help him the said bea swanson was last known to be living in baltimore they had come to baltimore to find her all well and good but unless willy s plan did what it was supposed to do mr bones would be marooned in this city of crab cakes and marble steps and what was he going to do then a phone call would have done the job in half a minute but willy had a philosophical aversion to using the telephone for important business he would rather walk for days on end than pick up one of those contraptions and talk to someone he could nt see so here they were two hundred miles later wandering around the streets of baltimore without a map looking for an address that might or might not exist of the two things willy still hoped to accomplish before he died neither one took precedence over the other each was all important to him and since time had grown too short to think of tackling them separately he had come up with what ploy to kill both birds with one stone the first has already been discussed in the previous paragraphs to find new digs for his furry companion the second was to wrap up his own affairs and make sure that his manuscripts were left in good hands at that moment his life s work was crammed into a rental locker at the greyhound bus terminal on fayette street two and a half blocks north of where he and mr bones were standing the key was in his pocket and unless he found someone worthy enough to entrust with that key every word he had ever written would be destroyed disposed of as so much unclaimed baggage in the twenty three years since he d taken on the surname of christmas willy had filled the pages of seventy four notebooks with his writings these included poems stories essays diary entries epigrams autobiographical musings and the first eighteen hundred lines of an epic in progress vagabond days the majority of these works had been composed at the but since her death four years ago he d been forced to write in the open air often battling the elements in public parks and dusty alleyways as he struggled to get his thoughts down on paper in his secret i heart of hearts willy had no delusions about himself he knew that he was a troubled soul and not fit for this world but he also knew that much good work was buried in those notebooks and on that score at least he could hold his head high maybe if he had been more scrupulous about taking his medication or maybe if his body had been a bit stronger or maybe if he had nt been so fond of malts and spirits and the hubbub of bars he might have done even more good work that was perfectly possible but it was too late to dwell on regrets and errors now willy had written the last sentence he would ever write and there were no more than a few ticks left in the clock the for himself if the words vanished it would be as if he had never lived that was where bea swanson entered the picture willy knew it was a stab in the dark but if and when he managed to find her he was convinced that she would move heaven and earth to help him once upon a time back when the world was still young mrs swanson had been his high school english teacher and if not for her it was doubtful that

nothing green here and it s spring outside southern spring i can smell it through moment on flowers to kill to drink blood and to have flowers not good enough want to make the book he said want to make it now and want you to come with me i wo nt hang around forever oh nonsense of course you will you think i m a doll do nt you you think i m cute and made of poured wax and you ll stay as long as i stay you re a bit mean armand you look like an angel and talk like a common thug such arrogance i thought you wanted me only on certain terms you lie david talbot i said i headed past him for the stairs cicadas sang in the night as they often do to no clock in new orleans through the nine pane windows of the stairwell i glimpsed the flowering trees of spring a followed down and down we went walking like regular men down to the first floor and out the sparkling glass doors and into the broad lighted space of napoleon avenue with its damp sweet park of green down the middle a park thick with carefully planted flowers and old gnarled and humble bending trees the whole picture moved with the subtle river winds and wet mist swirled but would not fall into rain itself and tiny green leaves drifted down like wilting ashes to the ground soft soft southern spring even the sky seemed pregnant with the season lowering yet blushing with reflected light giving birth to the mist from all its pores strident perfume rose from the gardens right and left from purple four o clocks as mortals call them here a rampant flower like unto weed but infinitely sweet and the wild irises stabbing upwards like blades out of the black mud throaty petals monstrously big battering themselves on old walls and concrete steps and then as roses of the young roses too whole for the tropical night roses coated with poison there had been streetcars here once on this center strip of grass i knew it that the tracks had run along this wide deep green space where i walked ahead of him slumward riverward deathward bloodward he came after me i could close my eyes as i walked never losing a step and see the streetcars come on follow me i said describing what he did not inviting him blocks and blocks within seconds he kept up very strong the blood of an entire royal vampire court was inside him no doubt of it count on lestat to make the most lethal of monsters that is after his initial seductive blunders nicolas louis claudia not a single one of the three able to take care of themselves alone and two perished and one lingering and perhaps the weakest vampire yet walking in the great brown face startled me he looked lacquered all over waxed buffed and once again i thought of spicy things of the meat of candied nuts and delicious aromas of chocolates sweet with sugar and dark rich butterscotch and it seemed a good thing suddenly to maybe grab ahold of him but this was no substitute for one rotten cheap ripe and odoriferous mortal and guess what i pointed over there he looked as i directed him he saw the sagging line of old buildings mortals everywhere lurked slept sat dined wandered amid tiny narrow stairs behind peeling walls and under cracked ceilings i had found one most perfect in his wickedness a great flurry of hateful embers of malice and greed and contempt smoldering as he waited for me we d come to magazine street and passed it but we were not at the river only almost and this was a street i had no recollection of their city louis s and lestat s just a narrow street with these houses the color of driftwood under the moon and windows hung with makeshift coverings and inside there was this one slouching arrogant vicious mortal fixed to a television set and guzzling malt from a brown bottle ignoring the roaches and the pulsing heat that pressed in from the open window this ugly sweating filthy and irresistible thing this flesh and blood for me the house was so alive with vermin and tiny despicable things that it seemed no more than a shell surrounding him crackling and friable and the same color in all its shadows as a forest no antiseptic modern standards here even the furniture rotted in the trashy clutter and damp mildew covered the grinding white refrigerator only the reeky personal bed and rags gave off the clue to reigning domesticity it was a proper nest in which to find this fowl this ugly bird thick rich pluckable devourable sack of bones and blood and shabby plumage human stench rising like a swirl of gnats and thereby put it off its hinges but not with much sound i walked on newspapers strewn on painted wood orange peels turned to brownish leather roaches running he did nt even look up his swollen drunken face was blue and eerie black eyebrows thick and unkempt and yet he looked quite possibly a bit angelic due to the light from the tube he flicked the magic plastic twanger in his hand to make the channels change and the light flared and flickered soundlessly and then he let the song rise a band playing a travesty people clapping trashy noises trashy images like the trash all around him all right i want you no one else does he looked up at me a boy invader david too far off for him to see waiting i pushed the television set to the side it teetered then fell onto the floor its parts breaking now splinters of glass a momentary fury overcame him charging his face with sluggish recognition he rose up arms out and came

him not from prudent miranda his excitement mounted as he went on through the list if he had had bunny killedand the thought had crossed his mind more than once in the year when it seemed that nothing else would get that great fool out of an office he was unfit to fillhe could not have chosen a better time he d had nothing to do with it fate had finally come over to his side he had proven himself capable of succeeding against the worst fate could do and now fatewomanlikehad chosen him for that very energy and persistence and will to triumph he closed his eyes a moment allowing himself the luxury of imagining the moment when he took over as speakerwhen the faces which had ignored or turned away turned to him had to turn to him and he could finally show his true abilities i will make the familias great and everyone will know who saved it from destruction r s s gyrfalcon i did nt know they would take it out of my pay ensign barin serrano said his voice almost squeaked but he could nt help it his entire paycheck gone nothing in his credit cube and he d already ordered the traditional engagement and wedding gifts well who did you think would pay for it those people have already used up the sector and they re not even charging you for all of them just the ones your pay will cover ten dependents barin murmured that would eat up all his pay after he was promoted too he supposed he should count himself lucky that fleet regulations prohibited official indebtedness and i m not even married how could they do this to me look at it this way sirit ll keep you out of trouble no not really i ve just sent in my order for the wedding well sir attention all hands attention all hands a pause during which barin tried to think how to get himself out of his present financial fix then

women r s s shrike lieutenant suiza there s a flash priority message cobalt encryption ummm esmay suiza s mind had drifted as it did often these days to barin right well keep a link to the ansible and i ll get the captain the last priority message had been medical directing them to relieve senior ncos with rejuv of duty but they had none aboard maybe this one would be useful what she wanted was a message from barin preferably with a friendly reaction from his family being on two different ships really hampered communication she hoped they could meet in person for a few days captain solis knew she was due leave he had already said she could take the time off but she d heard nothing captain solis never talkative this early in first shift became even more silent after the encrypted message had gone to his console esmay glanced over sir i said nothing lieutenant is dead assassinated presumably his gaze dropped to the readout of the decryption device presumably it s the new texas militia in retaliation for our execution of their rangers a pause during which esmay did her best not to ask the question that hammered at her mind he answered it anyway lieutenant you can count on all leaves being cancelled i m sorry there are some things more urgent than a wedding it wo nt hurt to do the paperwork esmay said without thinking solis gave her a long look but finally nodded good idea then if

recognized from his own occasional bouts of emotional distress scott crouched down offered a hand the bloodied treecat bumped it with his head begging for the touch leading scott to wonder if this treecat had been around humans before he stroked the treecat gently trying to determine from that cautious touch how badly injured it might be he found no wounds to account for the blood not even a sign of swelling or inflammation but the treecat clung to him and shivered and made broken little sounds that horrified scott nearly as much as they did fisher judging by the emotional aura his own treecat was projecting something truly dire had happened to this little treecat and scott received a strong premonition that and his companion when scott tried to pick the treecat up it let out a frightened sound that prompted fisher to rest both of his true hands on the other s nearest shoulder a moment later the filthy blood matted treecat swarmed into scott s arms huddling close fisher jumped up to his customary perch on scott s shoulder still crooning gently irina hesitated some distance away biting her lower lip uncertainly scott nodded her closer with a slight movement of his head and she approached slowly while scott stroked the painfully thin treecat reassuringly when irina stood beside him the stray let out a strange mewling little sound gazing up at her through grass green eyes as deep and wounded as a hurt toddler s poor thing she whispered gently offering a cautious hand the trembling treecat permitted her touch arching slightly in scott s arms as she stroked gently down its spine but it was scott the stray clung to all four upper limbs clenching in scott inside i wonder scott asked aloud moving cautiously toward the zivonik house you re hardly more than fur and bones you need food and water and god knows what else the washboard ribcage under his hands spoke of a prolonged deprivation and he could see cracked dried skin around the treecat s mouth eyes and delicate hands indicating dehydration as well scott stroked the distraught treecat gently whispering softly to it as he and irina slowly approached the meter thick stone walls of the zivonik house the most cursory examination told him the treecat was male toolong despite the dried blood in its fur irina called out alek the poor thing s half starved get some meat scraps for him a dish of cool water whatever we ve got left from dinner last night karl drag out that leftover turkey aleksandr said shooing the children inside no larisa you can look later after the treecat is mother stasya get some water for the treecat gregor run some hot soapy water and bring out a handful of clean towels yes papa children scattered kitchen s this way alek escorted him into the house scott moved cautiously inside with his unexpected patient irina trailing anxiously at his shoulder and entered a brightly lit kitchen just in time to see karl their oldest son setting out a platter with an enormous half stripped turkey carcass the boy set it down on a broad wooden dining table built to accommodate a growing family dig in the boy addressed the bedraggled treecat shyly cheeks flushed from excitement help yourself stasya the zivoniks middle daughter was carrying a basin of water to the table eyes round with wonder as scott set the thin treecat down it paused for only a moment as though making certain the offer were genuine then tore into the carcass with ravenous the wondrous creature on their kitchen table very few humans had actually seen one in person even stolid broad shouldered aleksandr zivonik hunkered down to watch the starving treecat tear into the carcass with surprisingly dainty hands visibly entranced by the sight of his diminutive sentient guest scott smiled gently fisher he said reaching up to stroke his friend i have to go back and help deliver that baby now can you stay with him scott had no idea how much his treecat actually understood of what he said but he and fisher generally had little trouble communicating basic things fisher simply swarmed down his arm and jumped to the table crooning softly to the battered treecat which was busily stuffing strips and hunks of turkey into emaciated jaws scott hauled his dirt streaked shirt off smiling gratefully at irina when she carried it toward the laundry room then scrubbed his arms with hot soapy water and disinfectant at the kitchen sink and hurried back to check on mrs zivonik the oldest of the zivonik daughters said at once how s the treecat she added anxiously edging toward the hallway eating your turkey dinner go on see for yourself the girl darted for the door scott found his patient nearly as apprehensive as her daughter when evelina gazed up at him it was nt injured she asked anxiously clearly mrs zivonik was as worried over the sudden appearance of an ailing treecat on their doorstep as her husband so little was known about treecats the abrupt appearance of a healthy one was often enough to upset the most steady of settlers a starvation thin one with blood in its fur was genuinely cause for fright and evelina zivonik was nt the only one afraid of the reasons for that treecat s condition scott was considerably disturbed himself despite nearly a full t year of daily contact with a treecat to accustom him to their sometimes startling habits and behaviors and the last thing evelina zivonik needed during a breech presentation he tried to reassure her as he resumed his interrupted work with the baby no i did nt find any actual injuries of course i ca nt hazard a guess when he last had a solid meal and anything to drink but he s wolfing down turkey as fast as he can tear it off the bones so
went to join his men the vietnamese positioned themselves on either side of the field and squatted to watch they seemed amused as the americans who took the infield picked up rocks from the base paths and tossed them off the field but their amusement ended when they saw how well the americans could sling a baseball around the infield the air filled with the pop of the hardball on a leather glove t p had pitched for his school s baseball team he took the mound as anderson caught and promptly struck out the first four americans then candy hit a booming fly ball and was the first player selected sensibar shaky hands and all proved to be a fine power hitter small dinked a judy hit in the shallow outfield showing off his fielding skills at shortstop rutkowski struck out and immediately started booking bets making the americans a five run favorite when anderson s turn came he slammed a ball in the gap between shortstop and second and turned it into a double but the highlight of practice came when phillips cracked a line drive to left that climbed and climbed until it disappeared over the distant treetops a boomer that brought the vietnamese to their feet applauding and caused the americans to cheer rutkowski changed the odds to get more action making the americans a nine run favorite the north vietnamese giants as home team took the field in the top of the inning after seeing the americans hit their pitcher was at first shaky but he settled downnot however until the americans had scored two runs a thin little man he threw mostly junk sinkers sliders knuckleballs junk the colonel had truly studied the game and taught his wards well with anderson at the plate chatting and vietnamese down in order the colonel studied each and every motion t p used each swing every batter took delta company hit three homers in one inning and small stole second in the third inning and home in the fourth the americans asserted their superiority in every phase of the game so it went until the fifth the colonel put in a fresh pitcher and changed all but three members of his lineup t p who had only a fastball and an outside curve suddenly faced batters who choked up on their bats and crowded the plate taking the outside edge of the plate away from him he walked two and grounded one out the next batter up hit a fly ball to shallow left the american covering left field charged in after the ball but fell into a hollow where he slammed to ground the ball landed two feet away from him and rolled to a stop as the fielder was carried off with a broken ankle t p gave the next batter a hard stare been for the first five innings the giants promptly recorded seven hits and five runs a bad inning but t p got out of it when one of the vietnamese hit into a double play and the third baseman tagged out another who was standing off base scratching his head because he did nt catch the colonel s signal to steal home the sixth inning was no better for t p he let the first two batters on base with granny hits over the second baseman anderson and tremble met on the mound he s lost it anderson said i can see it tremble said hey guys those jokers got lucky hell they re midget size got lucky tremble leaned his face into t p s lucky you call nine or ten hits in a row lucky y er outta here he said and sent t p to the outfield and brought in a kid named schofield who threw three warm ups and began firing bricks into anderson s up for in power still the vietnamese pushed two runners home after that the game settled into a defensive battle for two innings in the seventh one of the vietnamese dove after a ball in the outfield and planted his head in a hole another missed catching a rifle shot drive at second with his glove but stopped it with his face he lost three teeth candy made a save in the bottom of the seventh on a fly ball that was heading out and at the end of eight the score was even at eleven in the top of the eighth phillips took second on a sliding steal the vietnamese cheered him and several of them ran up and down the sidelines throwing themselves to the ground and sliding oblivious to the rocks they kept landing on thereafter every vietnamese who ran the bases dropped to the ground and slid in one hit a home run and slid into every base he crossed including home the americans shouted that was nt the way went wild over his performance in the top of the ninth phillips hit a towering home run that landed out of sight in the trees sensibar stumbled on a rock and bruised his knee going to second on an easy double instead of tagging him out the vietnamese held up play until he was able to stand then as he limped about changing direction they put him out on a run down play the colonel cheered from the bench the americans were astonishedthat also was nt how the game was played after delta company scored three in the top of the ninth the colonel brushing off his hands crossed the field and looked up at captain salazar it s a wonderful game is nt it i ve been thinking the one mistake americans make is playing to win and not for the joy today we will play until we can play no more but colonel that s not how the game is played the colonel was speaking of baseball as a metaphor for life you are surrounded by
a girl and her shadow the boys down on the low quay know a hundred ways to sell bad fish they ll mingle four dead eels with every one alive knowing full well the average man ca nt tell which is which tangled inside a cloudy tub they ll polish up a stinking mackerel with a bit of turpentine and buff it with their shirttails until it gleams beneath the wharves late in the day you can catch them blowing air into the bellies of cod to make their underweight catch look fat and succulent poor hungry family to puncture those flatulent fish and find them more air than meat but a boy s got to make a living and when he is forced to feel around in the mud at low tide scrambling after sprats dropped overboard from a trawler he may have to take a little advantage to earn his daily wage you notice it most on saturday nights when the markets are set up along low street the orange sellers have secretly boiled causes it to turn black within a day the cherry vendors have weighted their prepacked boxes with cabbage leaves to tip the scales not everyone is dishonest but nearly every merchant prefers to sell his wares after dark when their imperfections are softened by candlelight and men s eyes are less discerning after a full day s work most workers are paid on saturday night here in sunderland so they have money in their pockets for meat pies and jacket potatoes kept warm in barrel ovens they buy two pennies worth of greasy herring and a roll to go with it the young sons of public houseowners crisscross the market delivering trays of ale to wives who ve ordered it for their family dinners and are stopped along the way by so many thirsty men they have to run back for more on saturday night when the streets are extravagant with stacked purple cabbages ruby apples bright green leeks fringing stalls iridescent with oyster shells everyone feels rich there will be meat on sunday the expansive butcher holds out a newly slaughtered pig s heart like a present it is saturday night work is another two days away sunday you may play cards or walk out on the town moor or if you are feeling guilty about something wash your face and go to church perhaps you ll just want to sleep which is what happens most sundays when you take your tea on the stool by the fire and realize how good it feels just to sit and stare until your head drops down upon your chest and your cup slips from your fingers but saturday night you are alive and want some entertainment two new shows have come to town one is about that disease everyone keeps talking about the cholera morbus but the second one sounds far more promising the spectacle unique les chats savants signior capelli s celebrated menagery of sagacious cats well known in the principal cities of europe whose docility and intelligence never fail to astonish you could certainly stand receive tomorrow when you learn half the plums you bought tonight are rotted through will be decidedly less pleasant you push your way between the stalls along low street headed toward the theatre on sans on your right the river wear makes a snaking black ribbon between sunderland proper and well lit monkwearmouth on the opposite shore there are fewer ships on the river because of the quarantine you think and it is killing everyone from the keelmen who load newcastle coal to the potteries that need imported dorset clay your back room matchstick factory is safe at least no matter what happens for twenty years you ve painted phosphorus tips on little wooden splinters and you ve never for a day done without supplies the phosphorus is slowly rotting your jawbone and turning you into a freakish mess you ca nt bear to look in the glass but tonight saturday night you want only to see some sagacious cats and not think about how your hands and face glow in the dark get in half priceas if life were nt easy enough for them anyway you come upon a stampede housemaids leap squealing into coachmen little boys stomp stomp stomp like indians in a rain dance it s those damn frogs they ve come up from the riverbed where they ve been fucking and spawning fucking and spawning all this wet warm autumn until they ve overflowed the steep banks and invaded the town merchants along low street have found moist green frogs suffocated in their flour the pastor of trinity church found them floating in the communion wine just last night your landlord cursed the chorus of frogs yowling in his basement and sent down his ferret to rip through them now it seems the frogs are headed toward the nicer part of town they are advancing on bishop wearmouth the third and by far the most affluent section of sunderland built on higher ground to the south good you think let a little of the river bottom come up in the world like you have on too many nights that the lord has sent a modern plague of egypt to destroy this town how those dainty domestics and little children carry on jabbing their umbrellas at flailing rubbery legs frightening the frogs far more than they themselves are frightened you roll your eyes and dig into your pocket for the d they extort from you at the box office reach across to hand the rouged ticket vendor your money but if you please wait just a moment before you duck inside dear matchstick painter and disappear from view for what will be at least two hours we beg leave to ask what might at first seem a frivolous question but which will eventually make sense if you were to compose your own story forgetting for

own before surgery pictures for comparison she s paler too of that he s sure you need to be patient with her beth says i ll get the takeout menus he goes to the fireplace and sees the new vases are made of shards of old china on one fragment there is gold lettering that spells tuesday another has a beige fleur de lis one piece has the gray green stripe of a depression era cafeteria mug why it could be from a howard johnson s he thinks pleased he puts his mother out of his mind cecil and edna sit in her living room with its careful arrangement of long waisted ballerina figurines on a distress finished table it is edna s idea of someone else s idea of appealing a room like edna him a cup of tea in her pink art deco china with a dull panic he notices red pinpoints on her hand which he thinks he remembers are a sign of a blood disease he d like to blurt what is your illness but he sees that her determination to keep it secret is a perversity she treasures i hope beth will enjoy this set edna says lifting a cup toward him she has been sorting her belongings into teetering piles cecil realizes that if she were nt edna he would see how sad this is he would feel pity oddly he could do better then be more patient and tolerant but pitying his mother even if he could would open some immense family floodgate that they would all slip through helpless as trout something fragile is maintained in his reserve i ve found some things of your father s one is a wallet you made for him at summer camp he never used it she adds handing it back though he has no idea where it came from when he was ten edna taught him to polka after first insisting he wash his face and hands and comb his hair now as he remembers it it is not just the living room furniture that whirls by but his growing up his life the card games she taught them with complicated contradictory rules salamander she d yell suddenly her bangs permed like poodle fluff her cards flying like bats turn your head too

have shared she says ted s coming next week she says she killed a black widow in the bathroom but her chatter only communicates one thing to him her last chance hope for his love he wonders when he got old enough that the failure of this relationship became his failure and no longer hers how old was he when she called him cecil weasel and did nt he love her then he searches for a vanity where the irritations of who she is overwhelmed his dutiful affection when did his soul become so destitute a son who does not love his mother maybe it happened when he started medical school and she began to call him doctor not because her addressing him as doctor was pretentious and slightly mortifying but because suddenly he was important she adored him did he reject her because he guessed her love was based more on his status as a future physician than on who he really was my son the doctor or perhaps his failure came later during his residency did he despise edna because the glamorous speciality so delighted her my son the plastic surgeon did it happen when he understood that he did nt intend to dedicate his life to transforming the ropy patches of burn victims did he fear he d inherited her dubious ideals did cecil hate edna because her love was after all based precisely on who he really was why was nt she the right he the right kind of son beth sent this over he says remembering the fruit basket she had shoved into his hands take credit for it she had said how thoughtful she is edna says she picks up an apple rubs the skin to make it squeak an apple for your

washington d c july the car was a boxy late model ford sedan white over black innocuous bordering on invisible and very fast it had been a sheriff s vehicle originally bought at auction in tennessee and further modified for speed the car rolled north on wisconsin beneath a blazing white sun the men inside wore long sleeved shirts tails out their shirtfronts were spotted with sweat and their backs were slick with it the black vinyl on which they sat was hot to the touch from the passenger seat frank farrow studied the street the sidewalks were empty foreign made automobiles moved along quietly their occupants cool and cocooned heat mirage shimmered up off asphalt the city was narcotized it was that kind of summer day quebec said richard farrow his gloved hands clutching the wheel he pushed his aviator shades back up over the bridge of his nose and as they neared the next cross street he said upton frank you want to take that shoot off just past van ness i know it said richard you do nt

graham inflection into the chorus he had heard the single on whur earlier that morning and the tune would not leave his head the ford passed through the intersection at upton otis looked down at his lap where the weight of his shotgun had begun to etch a deep wrinkle in hislinen slacks well he should have known it all you had to do was look at linen to make it wrinkle that was a plain fact still a man needed to have a certain kind of style to him when he left the house for work its stock across the toes of his lizard skin monk straps he glanced at the street bought rolex strapped to his left wrist five minutes past ten a m richard cut the ford up th there said frank that chevy s pulling out i see it said richard they waited for the chevy then frank said put it in richard swung the ford into the space and killed the engine they were at the back of a low rise commercial strip that fronted wisconsin avenue the door leading to the kitchen of the pizza parlor may s was situated in the center of the block frank wiped moisture from his brush mustache and ran a hand through his closely cropped gray hair there s the caddy said otis noticing the black deville parked three spaces ahead frank nodded mr carl s making the pickup he s inside let s do this thing said otis said frank he drew two latex examination gloves from a tissue sized box and slipped them over the pair he already had on his hands he tossed the box over his shoulder to the backseat here double up roman otis raised his right hand where a silver id bracelet bearing the inscription back to oakland hung on his wrist he let the bracelet slip down inside the french cuff of his shirt he put the gloves on carefully then reflexively touched the butt of the fitted beneath his shirt he caught a glimpse of his shoulder length hair recently treated with relaxer in the rearview mirror shoot thought otis nick ashford could nt claim to have a finer head of hair on him otis smiled at his reflection his one gold tooth catching the light he gave himself a wink frank said richard we ll be out in a few minutes said frank do nt turn the engine over until wo nt said richard a catch in his voice the back kitchen door to may s opened a thin black man wearing a full apron stepped out with a bag of trash he carried the trash to a dumpster and swung it in bouncing it off the upraised lid on his way back to the kitchen he eye swept the men in the ford he stepped back inside leaving the door ajar behind him that him asked otis charles greene said frank good boy frank checked the woodsman and the bulldog holstered beneath his oxford shirt the guns were snug against his guinea t he looked across the bench at his kid brother sweating like a hard run horse breathing through his mouth glassy eyed scared stupid

take turns trekking back to the home office keeping one foot in both worlds until we could make the jump south for good in these months i could leave my daughter with her for a week at a time when i called susan s house on those weeklong trips it was difficult to get sarah even to come to the phone when she did her voice was filled with laughter and the abruptness that tells you that your call is an interruption for the first time in five years since nikki died our daughter was a carefree child even when susan s house was burglarized in the late winter i felt secure in her ability to protect and care for my daughter susan is seven years younger than i a dark haired beauty and divorced she has the fine features and innocent looks of a child coupled with the mind of a warrior for eight years susan has been the director of children s protective services in san diego an agency that investigates allegations of child abuse and makes recommendations to the da regarding prosecutions and to the courts regarding child custody to call susan s vocation a job is it with the zeal of a true believer children are her life her training is in early childhood development where the mantra save the kids has become a battle cry we have been seeing each other for more than two years though even now in san diego we do not live together i moved south to be with her but after some discussion we decided not to move in together at least not yet when i moved south some unstated law of independence dictated that we maintain separate households it seems we spend increasing amounts of time in each other s company that is when i am not on the road back to capital city that particular gordian knot will be cut as soon as harry and i have secured a sufficient client base in the south which is why today i am renewing an old acquaintance jonah and mary hale sit across the desk from me he has aged since i saw him last mary looks the same different hairdo but in the before ben s death and talia s murder trial oceans of water under that bridge jonah was one of my earliest cases in private practice soon after i left the da s office where i d cut my teeth the firm had directed him down the hall to the new man in the cubicle at the end at the time jonah was just a working stiff a married man in his fifties with a daughter in her late teens he was getting ready to retire against his will he worked for the railroad in capital city the locomotive works which was in its death throes jonah had a chronic bad back and knees thanks to years of toil on hard concrete lifting machine parts so when the railroad was looking to downsize he was an immediate candidate to go even now he walks with a cane though this one is much more ornate than the plain curved handled wooden stick i had seen him with back then the legs do nt get any better with into his chair to find the point of relative comfort but the smile is as good as ever i tell him only because i ve found an old friend i only hope you can help me jonah has the good looks of an aging hemingway with all the wrinkles in the right places even with his infirmities he has not put on weight his tanned face is framed by a shock of white hair his beard is close cropped his eyes deep set and gray he is a rugged looking man well dressed with a dark sweater vest under a cashmere sport coat and light colored slacks on his wrist is a gold watch the size of an oyster a rolex he could never have afforded in the old days i introduce him to harry i ve heard a lot about you says harry jonah just smiles he is used to this by now people

and stepped back to his table headed for the door good luck he called the guy crouched on the floor nodded vaguely and the couple at the distant table watched him go he turned his collar up and shrugged down into his coat and left the opera behind him and stepped out to the sidewalk it was dark and the air was chill with fall small haloes of fog were starting up around the lights he walked east to broadway and scanned through the neon for the office store it was a narrow place packed with items marked with prices on large pieces of fluorescent card cut in the shape of stars everything was a bargain which suited reacher fine he bought a small labeling machine and a tube of superglue then he hunched back down in his coat and headed north to jodie s apartment his four wheel drive was parked in the garage under her building he drove it up the ramp and turned south on broadway and west back to the restaurant he slowed on the street and glanced halogen light on white walls and pale wood no patrons every single table was empty and the owner was sitting on a stool behind the bar reacher glanced away and came around the block and parked illegally at the mouth of the alley that ran down toward the kitchen doors he killed the motor and the lights and settled down to wait the dynamics of the city the strong terrorize the weak they keep on at it like they always have until they come up against somebody stronger with some arbitrary humane reason for stopping them somebody like reacher he had no real reason to help a guy he hardly knew there was no logic involved no agenda right then in a city of eight million souls there must be hundreds of strong people hurting weak people maybe even thousands right then at that exact moment he was nt going to seek them all out he was nt mounting any kind of a big campaign but equally he was nt about could nt just walk away he never had he fumbled the label machine out of his pocket scaring the two guys away was only half the job what mattered was who they thought was doing the scaring a concerned citizen standing up alone for some restaurant owner s rights was going to cut no ice at all no matter how effective that concerned citizen might be at the outset nobody is afraid of a lone individual because a lone individual can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers and anyway sooner or later a lone individual dies or moves away or loses interest what makes a big impression is an organization he smiled and looked down at the machine and started to figure out how it worked he printed his own name as a test and pinched the tape off and inspected it reacher seven letters punched through in white on a blue plastic ribbon a hair over an inch long that was going to make the first guy s label about five inches long and the second guy ideal he smiled again and clicked and printed and laid the finished ribbons on the seat next to him they had adhesive on the back under a peel off paper strip but he needed something better than that which is why he had bought the superglue he unscrewed the cap off the tiny tube and pierced the metal foil with the plastic spike and filled the nozzle ready for action he put the cap back on and dropped the tube and the labels into his pocket then he got out of the car into the chill air and stood in the shadows waiting the dynamics of the city his mother had been scared of cities it had been part of his education she had told him cities are dangerous places they re full of tough scary guys he was a tough boy himself but he had walked around as a teenager ready and willing to believe her and he had seen that she was right people on city streets were fearful crossed to the opposite sidewalk to avoid coming near him they made it so obvious he became convinced the scary guys were always right behind him at his shoulder then he suddenly realized no i m the scary guy they re scared of me it was a revelation he saw himself reflected in store windows and understood how it could happen he had stopped growing at fifteen when he was already six feet five and two hundred and twenty pounds a giant like most teenagers in those days he was dressed like a bum the caution his mother had drummed into him was showing up in his face as a blank eyed impassive stare they re scared of me it amused him and he smiled and then people stayed even farther away from that point onward he knew cities were just the same as every other place and for every city person he needed to be scared of there were nine hundred and ninety nine others a lot more scared of him he used the knowledge in his walk and his gaze redoubled the effect he had on people the dynamics of the city fifty five minutes into the hour he moved out of the shadows and stood on the corner leaning back against the brick wall of the restaurant building still waiting he could hear the opera just a faint breath of sound coming through the glass next to him the traffic thumped and banged through potholes on the street there was a bar on the opposite corner with an extractor roaring and steam drifting outward through the neon glare it was cold and the people on the sidewalk were hurrying past with their faces ducked deep into scarves he kept his hands in his pockets and leaned
i was there i it was windy out a hot breeze was rustling through the tall pecan trees in the vacant lot behind the bus stop and a naughty by nature tune was blaring from the open window of perry s and beer joint across the street the small aluminum sided building was vibrating from the beat whatcha looking at i asked even friendlier than the first time my bracelet the girl said in a soft voice my bracelet it slipped off and fell down there i leaned in closely and peered into the rectangular shaped hole but all i could make out in the darkness was a white plastic cup and some pages of a crumpled old newspaper i do nt see nothing i said it s in there she said i got ta have it we got ta get it out i was nt really sure who she meant by we it was nt my bracelet that was down there i saw something moving around it s a rat i told myself a big hairy rat with red eyes and yellow teeth there were plenty of them in the bottom big shaggy monsters that lived in the walls of our tiny rent shacks underneath our porches and of course in the rain gutters that lined our littered streets i ai nt sticking my hands down in there girl you must be crazy i yelled the girl did nt even look my way she got down on all fours and shoved her thin hand into the drain as she leaned into the hole her dress hiked up exposing her underwear her yellow panties were shabby and ripped in several places the elastic was loose and hanging halfway down her bony thighs she was wearing worse than hand me downs she was wearing worn outs let me get your bracelet i said my arms are longer than yours i got down on all into the gutter and fished around in the trash until i felt something round it had to be the bracelet i pulled it out and stood up it was plastic transparent and purple you could buy a dozen like it for a buck in any dime store on main in downtown houston i handed it to her with a scowl on my face she snatched it and held it up to her breast like it was a new dress or something thanks she said with a big grin i woulda been really upset if i could nt of got it it s just an old plastic bracelet i snapped you can buy em for nothing downtown no you ca nt buy this anywhere it s a magic bracelet the girl said when i hold it up in the moonlight i become so tiny that only the ants can see me when the wind blows real hard wonderful beautiful place to land with that the girl slipped the bracelet over her wrist and stepped up on the curb i got ta go i m gon na be late for school she said fingering the bracelet and starting to walk off quickly you go to my school martin middle do nt you i asked yeah she said but my mama did nt give me money to ride the bus i m shayla what s your name i called after her kambia her voice trailed i m kambia i stood there in the street and watched her skinny body stepping lightly over the dirty sidewalks there was something that bothered me about that girl and her silly magic bracelet i just could nt imagine anybody showing underwear like that for a ten cent toy it was way too weird she was way too weird i stepped up on the curb weeks there had been nothing but rain buckets of it pouring out of the gray sky overflowing our gutters and flooding our streets but last night the rain stopped and this morning the sun was shining bright over our houses reclaiming its place among the clouds it looked like it was gon na be a nice day that is until mama got a visit from miss earlene jackson miss earlene lives in a large two story shack a few blocks up the street she is a mean spirited sour faced woman with pop eyes and a huge belly that hangs over her thin legs like an oversized water balloon the children in the neighborhood call her frog frog came raging up our porch steps around noon she had a look that would have turned the devil into a christian and she was throwing hell all over the place with each step mama stopped sweeping the living room floor she opened the screen door and stepped outside with her broom in her hand i followed her out can i help you miss earlene mama asked tugging the front of her flowered dress with her free hand mama had been doing housework all morning and her dress was drenched with sweat and clinging to her huge frame you sho can frog yelled throwing bits of spit in all directions you can tell that fast tail mare of yours to stay away from my doo witty excuse me mama said she opened her eyes real wide like she did nt believe what frog had said you heard me frog yelled you keep that little fast tail mare of yours away from my doo witty mama s eyes narrowed what fast tail mare of mine is you talking about she asked her voice was real calm and controlled but you could see just a hint of red pushing up through the ebony of her cheekbones that little butt wiggling leg spreading gal of yours tia that s you keep that little heifer from slipping round my house with my doo witty with doo witty with doo witty with doo witty mama repeated over and over like she was in some kind of trance tia
be careful getting onto the boat he told rosita i do nt want you to slip you ca nt do this to us i ve got to go home to my boys rosita cried luke could hear the note of hysteria in rosita s voice the poor kid is scared stiff he thought just a few years younger than regan and supporting two children on her own help her to grasp rosita s arm as fearfully she stepped down onto the deck of the swaying vessel you re very good at influencing people mr reilly c b complimented let s hope you re as successful for the next twenty four hours petey unlocked the door of the cabin and pushed it open releasing a dank musty smell into the cold outside air whew petey said that stink ll get you every time move it petey c b ordered i told you to get an airwick how thoughtful rosita said sarcastically as she followed petey inside luke glanced over at the manhattan skyline then looked upriver to the george washington bridge taking in the little red lighthouse underneath i wonder if i ll ever get the chance to see all this again he thought as c b pressed the gun in the small of his back inside mr reilly this is nt the overhead light as c b closed the door behind them on one side of the small shabby space was a seating area consisting of a formica dinette table surrounded by a cracked imitation leather banquette directly opposite was a matching couch the furniture was all built in units a small refrigerator sink and stove were adjacent to the table luke knew that the two doors to the left probably led to a bedroom and whatever passed for a bathroom oh no rosita gasped luke followed her stare and with dismay realized that two sets of chains were bolted to the walls in the seating area they were the kind of hand and ankle restraints commonly used to restrain criminal defendants in courtrooms one set was next to the couch the other near the banquette you sit here petey directed rosita keep me covered c b while i put her bracelets on i got everybody covered c b said emphatically you re over i d take my chances and try to grab his gun luke thought angrily but i ca nt risk rosita s life an instant later he was sitting on the banquette chained with rosita opposite him on the couch i should have asked if either one of you cares to use the facilities but now you ll just have to wait c b said cheerfully i do nt want to be late for my uncle s funeral after all i am the chief mourner and petey needs to get rid of your car when we come back petey ll bring stuff for your lunch i wo nt be hungry though my uncle paid for my meal today remember mr reilly c b opened the door as petey turned out the light an instant later the door slammed shut and luke and rosita could hear the grating of the key turning in the rusty lock trapped in the shadowy darkness of the swaying boat of their precarious situation hit both of them then rosita asked quietly mr reilly what s going to happen to us luke chose his words carefully they ve already told us they re looking for money assuming that s all they really want i promise it will be paid all i can think about is my kids my regular baby sitter is away until next week and i do nt trust the girl who s filling in her christmas dance is tonight she did nt want to work at all today but i begged her to she expects me home by three she would nt leave the boys alone you do nt know her mr reilly she wo nt miss that dance rosita said with certainty a catch in her voice i ve got to get home i ve just got to get home regan opened her eyes groggily sat up swung her legs over the in her parents apartment on central park south was as comfortably familiar as the one in the family home in new jersey in which she d been raised today though she did not take time to appreciate the charming ambience of the peach and soft green color scheme she had the sensation of having slept a long time but when she looked at the clock she was glad to see it was only a few minutes before two she wanted to phone the hospital and see how her mother was doing then catch up with her father she realized that beyond the fact that she was feeling the effects of the news about her mother s accident and the hurried red eye flight she was filled with undefined anxiety a quick shower might help me clear my mind she thought and then i ll get moving she put in a call to la parisienne the local coffee shop and placed her usual breakfast order orange juice coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese thought by the time i get out of the shower the delivery boy will be ringing the bell the strong spray of hot water felt good on her back and shoulders she quickly washed her hair stepped out of the shower wrapped herself in a robe and rolled a towel around her head ten seconds later her face glistening with moisturizer she answered the door for the delivery boy she was glad he pretended not to notice her appearance in his job he s seen it all she thought but he did produce a sunny smile when she gave him a generous tip moments later the bagel unwrapped the coffee cup in her hand she phoned her mother s room she knew the
days mr fairgrieve did not flinch st mary s is an orphanage then susannah nodded as well as a school and a hospital he sat in silence for some time absorbing what she had said and you he asked finally me she replied confused how did you wind up there at this school i i was raised there she looked down at the baby and rocked just a little faster in the sturdy wooden chair speckles of sun washed dust twinkled in the air one of those children you read about in penny dreadfuls left on the doorstep in a basket except that i was in an old fruit box i m sorry she bristled slightly although there had been a note of gruff kindness in his voice do nt be i was very happy at st mary s the nuns were good to me and i was given an education of sorts you never married it might have been either a question or a statement he spared so little inflection for the words susannah felt the old hollowness inside and quelled it quickly the baby was asleep now sweet and sated no she said softly and at some length i worked as a companion after i left school and there never seemed heavily shoved a hand through his lustrous hair until you left your work to come here to seattle susannah wanted to weep though she did not allow herself that release fearing she might never stop crying i felt i could do nothing else julia s letters i can well imagine julia s letters he said wearily and with some disgust he spread his hands started to say something else and bit back the words i wo nt be a burden mr fairgrieve susannah said perhaps too quickly she was a proud woman but she was prepared to beg if that was what she had to do i can give music lessons if you will allow me the use of julia s piano and of course i will pay room and board all this he asked rising to his feet for a stranger s child julia was not a aubrey answered i do nt suppose she was to you but i am he paused are nt you afraid to live under the same roof with the sort of monster julia must have made me out to be she met his fierce gaze held it i can look after myself she said evenly my concern is for this baby i d like to call her victoria if you do nt mind she should have a name call her whatever you like aubrey replied his voice cool poor julia susannah muttered aloud quite inadvertently fairgrieve leaned forward until his nose was barely an inch from susannah s poor julia he replied with quiet mockery god rest her soul cared for nothing and no one but herself her greatest worry where this child was concerned was that the pregnancy might spoil her figure therefore whatever you do please do wife susannah blinked shocked by the cold fury of such a reply yes she d known that julia was nt happy in the marriage at least not in its latter days but even then she had never guessed that the situation had deteriorated into such bitterness and rancor as mr fairgrieve was displaying now i do not wish to argue the quality of my friend s character with you or anyone else she said but julia looked forward to the birth and she loved you very much at least in the beginning i know that from her letters fairgrieve s expression was one of exasperated contempt and for all that he was still very attractive a contradiction that unsettled susannah to no small degree julia would nt have known love from the grocer s lame horse he snapped from the moment she knew she was pregnant she bewailed her fate and cursed me for a rutting bull with no concern for her huffing breath as though i had anything to do with it susannah s eyes widened as his implication struck home but she refused to honor such a suggestion with a response like everyone else julia had not been perfect she had been quite shallow in some ways and she could be childish and petulant at times but she had many good qualities as well if aubrey fairgrieve had been her husband then he was without question the father of this child and that as far as susannah was concerned decided the matter we seem to be thinking of two different women she said in a reflective tone you knew one julia and i knew another apparently he ground out she held the child just a little tighter and she saw in his eyes that he understood the gesture for what it was a declaration she was laying claim to a place a prominent place in this baby s to the idea of surrender in any shape or guise julia had been at least partially correct it appeared in her bitter assessment of her husband s nature he was bone stubborn a man who liked getting his own way he glared at her for a long moment without another word and then turned and left the kitchen susannah lingered in the chair for a while thinking and then went back upstairs laid the baby carefully on her bed securing her on either side with pillows that done she fashioned a cradle from one of the bureau drawers padding the bottom with a folded blanket and the sides with rolled towels no doubt there was a nursery somewhere in the house but for now this arrangement would do after moving a soundly sleeping victoria to the improvised crib she ventured out long enough to locate the splendid bathing room julia had written her about took a hasty bath in the giant copper tub with its tank of hot water a hook on
prologue entibor an jemayne eraasi sus peledaen orbital station on a world not his own in a life he had never anticipated arekhon sus khalgath sus peledaen sleptand sleeping dreamed in his dream he knelt in the meditation chamber of the starship toolong where he had not gone in his waking body for over a dozen years his staff a cubit and a half of black wood bound with silver lay on the deck in front of him and all around him the daughter vibrated with the urgency of her passage through the void arekhon wondered what he was meant to do had he only now begun his meditation here inside his dream or had he just ended it he could nt remember but somewhere outside the chamber an alarm began to sound he picked up his staff in his right hand and got to his feet outside the chamber the alarm bell continued its steady pulse note chime he found the door and opened it and stepped throughnot but into the old hall at demaizen and the warm golden light of an autumn afternoon garrod syn aigal sus demaizengreat magelord void walker and finder of worldshad taken the land and fortune that were his inheritance and had used them to build a circle strong enough and dedicated enough to carry out the greatest of great workings to bring together the two parts of the sundered galaxy crossing the interstellar gap and healing a rift that had existed since the unimaginably long ago arekhon had left the sus peledaen fleet and his family altars to become a part of lord garrod scircle and when the working demanded it of him he had left his native world as well he had walked through the old hall in dreams often enough since then in the years after the demaizen mage circle had split apart in fire and blood but never as now with the weight of knowledge bearing down hard upon him in these rooms he had grown from a sus peledaen fleet apprentice with a knack for seeing the eiran and making luck now he came back to them with the sound of the daughter s alarm bell following him wherever he went sometimes in his dreams he saw the mages of demaizen as he had known them before on those nights he sparred with delath or serazao in the long gallery or talked of space and stars with kiefen diasul though in the waking world both del and zao were dead and kief had betrayed all of them years ago tonight though was different instead of delath or serazao the dream gave him iulan vai vaithe last come member of the circle who had brought too long from her employers the sus radal to save the demaizen mages from utter destruction and who had stayed behind on eraasi in order to repay the debt arekhon found her in the long gallery with its tall westward facing windows and its racks of exercise mats and limber practice staves she had nt altered her appearance since the last time he saw her in the flesh under the touch with rusty brown highlights and she still clothed her compact frame in tunic and leggings of ordinary black iule he saidthough she had always refused the forms of affection even with those who might have had a claim to use them what are you doing here looking for you did you think you could go away forever i did nt think i had a choice you did nt she told him not then but everything changes and we have to change with it as she spoke the light from the westering sun struck the windowpanes at a new and sudden angle dazzling his eyes for a moment when the glare died he was nt seeing iulan vai any longer another woman looked at him in her place an older woman whose thick black hair was shot through with wide streaks of iron grey and whose skin was the color of burnished copper not vai though like staff and not anyone else he recognized do i know you he asked her not yet she said but soon outside the long gallery somewhere in the roomsand the lifethat he had left behind him the sound of the daughter s alarm changed from a bell note to a strident metallic wail you have to leave now it s almost time natelth sus khalgath sus peledaen stood with his back to the observation deck of his orbiting shipyard and stronghold his face only a few inches from the armored glass that gave the deck its name the world of eraasi lay before him a great globe against the starfield black in the vacuum of space stars glittering all around it the sunset line lay across the world on the left as he looked at it the darkened crescent alive with city lights he knew that elsewhere hidden beyond the bulk of the planet the citadel of the sus radal fleet family circled but natelth secure in his own place hardly thought of the sus radal he led and the other star lords followed and if he started hopping on one foot before long theledau sus radal would be bouncing around on his head natelth heard the swish click of the doubled inner airlocks that isolated the observation deck from the rest of the station but he did nt turn he would have known who was approaching him even if the armored glass had not shown him her reflected image his sister isayana joining him in the safety of exile from the planet s surface had come bearing news he hated living on the orbiting station he watched isayana s reflection approaching not a twin of his own but close enough that he and she had often been mistaken for such when both were young the same square frame and strong features the same black hair now going grey
hostess i thought we might go riding like old times nick wore no emotion i ca nt sheridan i m working you call that work she laughed besides you re the boss you set your own hours sorry i ll have to take a rain check their gazes locked billie felt like an intruder finally sheridan dismounted and handed over her horse to a waiting groom she left without comment although billie sensed her anger boiling inside billie looked at nick and noted the strange twist to his lips are you laughing at me this is called a grimace nick demonstrated while he talked let s start with the basics now this is a saddle billie he was taking up his valuable time no telling what was going on back at the house and seeing sheridan again after all these months had left him shaken he had enough problems and billie pearce was only adding to them this is a stirrup mr kaharchek pay attention now you slide it up snug against the saddle like this this is a girth you unhitch the girth and the saddle slides off you can take the saddle pads off the horse at the same time he motioned for a stable hand lurking just inside the barn from the look on the kid s face bafflement and amusement he d witnessed the whole thing nick avoided eye contact instead he handed the saddle to the youth and in turn took a blue nylon halter from him he pulled billie toward zeke s head always leave the reins over the horse s neck while you re removing the bridle he placed her hand behind zeke s crown piece you gently slide it over the horse s ears and he paused when billie s face suddenly registered pain her face went white something wrong he sonmyfoot the dumb son of a horse is on my foot she tried to shove zeke but it was like trying to move mount everest tears smarted her eyes nick reacted quickly one firm touch and the big chestnut gelding calmly shifted away from billie she stared wide eyed at her brand new riding boot perfectly branded with the imprint of zeke s hoof she gasped in pain my foot is broken it s probably shattered she glared at the horse was she just imagining the smug expression she d seen that same look on sheridan flock s face you did that on purpose she accused she shot a glance at nick he obviously finds it amusing nick had to agree it did look as though zeke were smiling i ll signaled for the hovering boy to take zeke away and brush him down before putting him into his stall that s not a damn bit funny billie said as she watched the horse walk away with a jaunty sway of its hips if body language was anything to go by the animal clearly thought it was the victor in their little encounter as for her jaunty swaying was out of the question she could nt put any weight on her foot i ll never walk again she wailed mrs pearce please calm down nick sighed just when he thought things could nt get worse the woman was really hurt she d probably managed not to sign a release form and would likely sue the pants off him his insurance company would cancel his polo school would be history and she was hurt that was the worst part his protective instincts snapped alive her pretty eyes were swimming with tears she refused to shed belligerent set to her chin and decided she probably was brave even if it did nt look that way at the moment he scooped her into his arms and turned toward the barn her mouth popped open in surprise but he felt her arms circle around his neck as though she realized she had no choice she pressed against him for support just what he needed after having her fall full length against him coming in contact with him in all the right places he envisioned her children and their friends coming home at the end of the day to the smell of homemade cookies and tall glasses of milk he envied them wondered if they realized how lucky they were having been raised by one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the state he d had little opportunity for warm straight out of the oven cookies and cold milk billie shifted and the soft material of her tank top brushed against his bare arms she felt soft and curvy and feminine a nice contrast never be thin enough he owed zeke a nice red apple damn he had no business thinking how soft and warm billie pearce was she had room mother and pta spokesperson written all over her pretty face she would never consider a three day weekend filled with sun fun and great sex she was different and she would nt appreciate knowing he was aroused just thinking about her inside the barn nick plunked her down on a bench how does it feel smushed smushed lord she was talking like her sixth graders how do you think it feels she snapped it feels like a horse crushed it to smithereens we have to get the boot off oh no you do nt not without ordering me a morphine drip he almost smiled mrs pearce i need to examine your foot that means i have to pull off the boot me drawn and quartered billie sucked in her breath and gripped the bench as he gingerly worked the boot off her injured foot she closed her eyes trying to remember the breathing techniques she d learned in lamaze class years before as she prepared for labor and delivery when her children were born she took a deep cleansing breath and concentrated on the top of nick s head she wanted to touch
domineering moods she knew how to get around him just laugh at him when he got into one of his conniptions but he always scared me green even though i knew he would nt do nothing but fuss he s never even threatened to fire me judge could say the most cruel things though you d do anything to make him stop she stared at the old man in the chair searching for some trace of the bearlike tyrant he had once been judge can be funny when he wants to be people used to say he was more like andy griffith than andy hisself but he has a side to him too sometimes i felt about eight years old when i was around judge and i used to wonder if that would have changed if i d had an education and an outside job to make money that did nt come from him it s hard to say well he was my boss and i let him have the last word every time that s for sure and you know i could never imagine him losing that power i never could picture judge old and weak wasting away i always thought he d just keel over one day from sheer rage you know caught behind a farm truck on the no passing stretch of route oh he hates slow drivers i thought one day judge would boil over in fury and burst an artery and it would all be over in two seconds one minute he d be his fierce old self and the next minute he d be gone instantaneous darkness like a power outage in a thunderstorm that is the one thing about judge i was sure of nora bonesteel nodded but she was still looking out at the old man in the lawn chair she had never seen the tyrannical side of john walker but then she did nt have to live with him the dark side of mountain politeness is that an angry man sometimes swallows his rage against in the privacy of his home she d known of more than one genial and witty man who was a terror in private whatever john walker s anger had been about it was gone now all that was left was the mccourry indifference the hunkering down into the sufficiency of self that was the mccourrys strength and their refuge and ultimately the source of their loneliness there was nothing she could do to change that and even if she could it was likely that john would nt want her to try it would have been easier on everybody would nt it said becky if judge had just died in a heartbeat during one of his rages nora bonesteel considered it hardly any way is easy she said when people are taken sudden their families grieve because there was nt time to resolve things to make peace and say good bye oftentimes they are left with guilt at least you ve been given time to settle becky did nt see any point in trying to make peace with a deaf old man who had probably forgotten most of the injuries he had inflicted cruel words and slights that still hurt her to the heart when she let herself dwell on them what could he possibly say that would make up for the past and how much sincerity would there be in any profession of forgiveness she made speaking of resolving things you ve called his daughter have nt you becky tilden s eyes widened and she darted a glance at john walker to see if he had heard them no she whispered i ca nt he d never let me nora bonesteel s face hardened into the scowl reserved for irreverent boys in sunday school class and why not he would nt let me he never wants her to know when he s took sick he d say it s on account of lark being so famous and busy and all and pains but that s not the real reason they did nt get along you know never did he does nt want her to come never mind what he wants becky tilden and do nt try to tell me that an eighty three year old man could stop you from making a phone call dying in peace is a fine thing i m sure but leaving your family in peace is just as important and if that man goes without letting his only child come to say good bye it will be the cruelest thing he s ever done to her and to my mind that s saying something becky s face took on the mulish expression that meant that she would try to get out of the chore without making an outright refusal even if i call her she may not want to come back she ought to be given the chance though it s her that has to go on living with memories so i say it s that or shall i becky s clouded face cleared with relief oh miz nora would you tell him ever time i try to talk about lark he just sets his face like a stone idol and turns away muttering would you like me to take you out to him now so you can tell him nora bonesteel sighed i ve known john a long time but we re not close this would be better coming from you but if i have to do it i will john walker never scared me any not even waving a black snake over his head and i m not about to start being afraid of him now well try not to upset him it will be all right becky i wo nt leave until he s back in a good mood you go in and call his daughter tell her she may not have long to dither about this becky gasped know nora bonesteel
jared s heart monitor or at least that s what he assumed it was attached to an iv was pushed up against the wall on a rolling bed waiting for a room assignment the man or womanhe could nt tell whichwas curled up in a fetal position facing the wall as he walked past he could tell that the patient on the table was a woman after glancing at the thinning tangles of long silver hair on her pillow he saw a freshly bandaged bloody stump where her right foot should have been as if her stick thin leg had simply vanished at the tip an amputee probably diabetes he thought lucas heard the old woman moan softly but he kept walking his son s heart song beckoning him beyond the partition through the clear plastic of the isolation tent over jared s bed lucas could see his son s face his eyes were closed his eyelids no longer fluttering immediately lucas gazed at the electrocardiograph monitor at jared s bedside to be reassured by the jagged pulses of his heartbeat on the small screen good how many nights had lucas fallen asleep to the sound of that machine s beeping often sleeping near jared s heart monitor he d awakened from dreams that he d heard the jarring tone of a flat line signaling that jared s heart had stopped maybe they had nt been dreams he thought sadly maybe they d only been glimpses into a future that was drawing closer all the time because he had known all along that jared would not get well had nt he even when he d pretended his knowing was only irrational dread left over from losing rachel it had probably been genuine intuition all along no surprise that jared s acute myelocytic leukemia had turned out to be so difficult to cure no surprise that the chemo had nt worked no surprise that the bone marrow procedure had nt worked either and ultimately it had been no surprise that one of the most powerful shamans in the world the one jared called magic man had nt been able to it was was determined to have jared too and contrary to what jared believed lucas did nt think it had the first thing at all to do with god lucas was convinced it was the work of something else altogether three ravens perez the arizona based healer known globally for his successful treatment of terminal patients had told lucas as much in a rare moment of weary frustration perez was an old friend one of the first shamans to teach lucas the observable merits of spirit based healing rituals and lucas had seen the anguish in his friend s face when perez had flown to tallahassee to perform a healing ceremony on jared shortly before the bone marrow transplant lucas s optimism during the brief remission period had been crushed by something haunted in the powerful man s eyes and perez s words spoken to lucas in a hush while they drank tepid coffee had been even more haunting this is hard for me to say to you but you have a right to hear it the same shadows with rachel smelled the same foulness i have never known shadows like these i m afraid they wo nt heed good medicine i think they have hunted for him well champ you missed a good one today lucas began at jared s beside his tone much more upbeat than his thoughts jared had told him he sometimes heard the things lucas said when he was unconscious or sleeping so lucas had made it a habit to talk and sing to him jared had probably heard him sing every robert johnson song ever recorded from love in vain to ramblin on my mind if slightly off key in case it made a small difference slipping his gloved hand into the tent lucas smoothed back jared s wispy light brown hair which only curled where it grew thickest at the top of his head the hair too he d inherited from rachel along with his skin color jared s complexion had skin but his son s face was now almost ghostlike as if he d been dusted with powder in the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights above them lucas could even see tiny blue webs of capillaries under jared s skin just below his eyes he looked almost like a stranger still aided by the oxygen tubes in his nose jared s chest rose and fell steadily his breathing sounded good not bubbling in his chest the way it did when he had fluid in his lungs lucas squeezed jared s unmoving fingers and the warmth that bled through the plastic felt like sunshine let s see now you know i get the names all mixed up but i ll remember as best i can lucas said stooping over to speak close to jared s ear these mutant men of yours are ugly as can be jared is ned nuke the one with the face like swiss cheese in any case i think ned nuke earth s population by poisoning the air so he and the other one the black one is his name freddy fallout well the two of them teamed up with that really big one who has tentacles for arms that one you like so much hearing the soothing tones of his own voice lucas began to forget where he was and details from the past few hours the past few wretched years began to melt away in his mind this was no different from countless times before when he d told jared bedtime stories about his other favorite heroes trying to save the world it was nt so different at all but his fantasy ended abruptly when he realized he could hear the old woman calling out he must have been ignoring her dismissing her voice as background noise
eggs and measure flour and make change and nobody could abuse me and where they d even expect me to be fat every flab roll and cellulite crinkle would serve as testimony to the excellence of my baked goods i wished i could trade places with the guy who wore the fresh sushi sandwich board and walked up and down pine street at lunch hour handing out sushi coupons for world of wasabi maybe dead i pictured myself lying in the bathtub taping a note to the mirror taking a razor blade to my wrists then i pictured nifkin whining and looking puzzled scraping his nails against the rim of the bathtub and wondering why i was nt getting up and i pictured my mother having to go through my things and finding the somewhat battered copy of best of penthouse letters in my top dresser drawer plus the pink fur lined handcuffs bruce had given me for valentine s day finally i pictured the paramedics trying to maneuver my dead wet body down three flights of stairs we ve got a big one here i imagined one of them saying okay so suicide was out i thought rolling myself into the comforter and arranging the orange pillows under my head the muffin shop sandwich board scenario while tempting was probably not going to happen i could nt see how to spin it in the alumni magazine princeton graduates who stepped off which they would then turn into a chain of successful muffin shops which would then go public and make millions and the muffin shops would only be a diversion for a few years something to do while raising their kids who would invariably appear in the alumni magazine clad in eensy beansy black and orange outfits with class of written on their precocious little chests what i wanted i thought pressing my pillow hard against my face was to be a girl again to be on my bed in the house i d grown up in tucked underneath the brown and red paisley comforter reading even though it was past my bedtime hearing the door open and my father walk inside feel him standing over me silently feeling the weight of his pride and his love like it was a tangible thing like warm water i wanted him to put his hand on my head the way he had then to hear the smile in his voice when he d say and loved and thin i wanted that i rolled over groped for my nightstand grabbed a pen and paper lose weight i wrote then stopped and thought find new boyfriend i added sell screenplay buy large house with garden and fenced yard find mother more acceptable girlfriend somewhere between writing get and maintain stylish haircut and thinking make bruce sorry i finally fell asleep good in bed ha he had a lot of nerve putting his name on a column about sexual expertise given how few people he d even been with and how little he d known before he d met me i had slept with four people three long term boyfriends and one ill considered freshman year fling when bruce and i hooked up and i d fooled around extensively with another half dozen i might ve been a big girl but i d been reading cosmopolitan since i was thirteen and i knew my way around the various pieces of equipment at least i and bruce was nt he d had a few harsh turn downs in high school when he d had really bad skin and before he d discovered that pot and a ponytail could reliably attract a certain kind of girl when he d shown up that first night with his sleeping bag and his plaid shirt he was nt a virgin but he d never been in a real relationship and he d certainly never been in love so he was looking for his lady fair and i while not averse to stumbling into mr right was mostly looking for well call it affection attention actually call it sex we started off on the couch sitting side by side i reached for his hand it was ice cold and clammy and when i casually slung an arm over his shoulder then eased my thigh against his i could feel him shaking which touched me i wanted to be gentle with him i wanted to mine and tugged him off the couch let s lie down i said we walked to my bedroom hand in hand and he lay on my futon flat on his back his eyes wide open and gleaming in the dark looking a bit like a man in a dentist s chair i propped myself up on my elbow and let the loose ends of my hair trail gently across his cheek when i kissed the side of his neck he gasped as if i d burned him and when i eased one hand inside his shirt and gently tugged at the hair on his chest he sighed ah cannie in the tenderest voice i d ever heard but his kisses were horrible slobbery things all bludgeoning tongue and lips that felt as if they were somehow collapsing when they met mine so that i was left with a choice between teeth and mustache his hands were stiff and clumsy lie still i whispered i m all wrong are nt i shh i breathed my lips against his neck once more the tender skin right where his beard ended i slid one hand down his chest lightly feathered it over his crotch nothing doing i pressed my breasts into his side kissed his forehead his eyelids the tip of his nose and tried again still nothing well this was curious i decided to show him a trick to teach him how to make me happy whether he could get hard or not he moved me enormously this
was trotting by and the captain looked at the line passing down the defile i think we d better hurry to get in front of the band yep roger agreed looking at the distant city i m really looking forward to getting to civilization let s not go too fast pahner cautioned as he started forward this is liable to be a new experience different hazards different customs these mountains are a fairly effective barrier especially for a bunch of cold blooded mardukans so these folks may not take all that kindly to strangers we need to take it slow and careful slow down kosutic called the city is nt going anywhere the company had been moving through the twisting mountain valleys towards the distant city for the last two days it turned out that the pass they d exited from was on a different watershed that they d run out of fodder for the packbeasts who were becoming increasingly surly about life in general fortunately they d recently entered a flatter terrain of moraines and alluvial wash it was well forested and by slowing down they d been able to let the flar ta forage but that only worked if the point kept the pace down gotcha sergeant major liszez replied over his helmet com and slowed down pausing for a moment to look around the path they were following was wide for a game trail and well beaten the vegetation was open on either side and the lower limbs of the coniferlike evergreens had been stripped off by some forager which permitted good sight distance unlike the damn jungle he d stopped at the edge of an open area it looked like whatever had been eating on the trees had used the clearing for rooting because the ground was torn up and turned over in every direction it was also fairly other side the morning was clear and cool with the dew just coming off the bushes this area was a blessed relief for the company but they still wanted to keep moving not only did they look forward to a respite in the city but the faster they went the sooner they would reach the coast the coast was of course only an intermediate stop but it had begun to loom large in the minds of the company the coast was an end in itself now and on maps it looked like they were nearly there they were nt at best it was weeks away through the jungles on this side of the mountains but at least it was getting closer and closer and that was a damned good thing liszez told himself because good as their nanites were at extracting usable nutrition from the most unlikely sources there were limits in all things the severe losses the company had taken at voitan and marshad helped a because each dead marine had been one less charge on the priceless cache of vitamin and protein supplements packed on the animals and on their own backs fewer mouths meant they could stretch their stores further but once the stores were gone they were gone and the shipwrecked humans were dead so the sooner they could get their butts aboard a ship and set sail the better liszez looked over his shoulder and decided the column had closed up enough he reminded himself to keep the pace down checked his surroundings for threats and moved out on his third step the ground erupted roger looked at the trees the stripped bark reminded him of something and he glanced at his asi cord these trees yes flar ke we need to be careful the shaman said pahner had finally convinced the prince that the lead packbeast was not a place for the commander to be but roger still big eleven millimeter magnum hunting rifle so far in the mountains the only hazards had been inanimate but marduk had taught them not to let their guards down and the prince keyed his radio on the reserve command frequency captain cord says that this area is flar ke territory like where we first met him pahner did nt reply for a moment and roger remembered the marine s incandescent rage on that long ago day the prince never had explained to the captain that the company s free flow com net had been so unfamiliarand confusingto him at the time that he genuinely had nt heard the marine s order not to fire at the flar ke which had been pursuing cord it had been roger s very first personal experience with a full fledged tongue lashing and pahner s fury had been so intense that the prince had decided that anything which sounded like an excuse would have been considerably worse than useless at the same time even if he had heard the order he would have taken the nt taken it to save cord eitherno one had even known the shaman was there to be saved no he d fired because he d hunted more types of dangerous wild game than most people in the galaxy even realized existed and he d recognized the territorial strop markings on the trees in the area markings very like those which surrounded them now i see the captain said finally and roger knew the same memories had been passing through the older man s mind they d never discussed the episode again and roger sometimes wondered how much that owed to the fact that the flar ke so closely resembledphysically at least the flar ta packbeasts with which the company had become intimately familiar flar ta could be extremely dangerous in threat situations but the huge herbivores were scarcely aggressive by nature and a part of the captain had to have noted the relative passivity of the flar ta and transposed it to the flar ke at least subconsciously as proof that he d been right to order his nt even have considered that
drive hard joe mary ann s blue again so i want to be home by ten this from the boss will will trona orange county supervisor first district mary ann is his wife yes sir talk while you drive are you carrying the usual will was on edge again lots of that lately he sat down beside me like he usually did never in the backseat unless he was in conference only in the front where he could watch the

without looking at me leaned back his head eyelids half down but his eyes moving he usually looked like he was disappointed with what he saw a way to make it better but there was also something affectionate in his expression pride of ownership will reached down between his feet and snapped open his leather briefcase he took out the black calendar set the briefcase back on the floorboard then started scribbling with a pen he liked to talk while he wrote sometimes it was to himself and sometimes it was to me growing up with him since i was five working nights for him since i was sixteen i

car if it violated school rules do nt treat me like a cripple he had blurted as if my mere enforcement of a rule did any such thing but the statement stunned us both and expression of anger forced me to back off i let him take the car despite myself but he had still gone off angry leaving me to fume even more i recalled that with horror now because that was how had gone off michael where are you friday afternoons at wiesbaden were marked as i imagined it by an explosion of pent up all american energy boys heading out to the ball field girls in the gym putting up crepe paper streamers for the sock hop kids in dungarees and pedal pushers going over to the teen club to feed the jukebox and the coke machine i pictured it all from my place at the large bow front window looking across the garden toward mosbacher strasse and the happy images of young people at play undid me i took in the teeth a blast of new self reproach so michael wanted to stay over in wiesbaden and what go to the big game the next day or take a date to the american movie theater at the base exchange if he did nt dance and why not with a car why had i let that become an issue and what was it about me that sparked anger in those i loved did his failure to show up now mean he was still angry was this my punishment for the real offense which he had dared to name that i did treat him like a cripple michael where are you the clock was striking again and to my surprise the half conscious count i kept brought me to seven seven o clock it was nearly dark outside he was nt here and he had nt called if there d been a wreck would the german police have a way of knowing to call here the thought of the german police brought me back to the scene in rhine main hall on the previous monday what i had been reading about what i had witnessed i replayed it the intruder coming up behind the tall g touch the back of his neck podium that red spray the gunman disappeared through the curtain as quickly as he had come in short order the green uniformed police arrived the meeting was adjourned and i returned to my office where almost at once i began to wonder if i had imagined it all the dead man had been identified in the program as markus von siedelheim a name that meant nothing to me at the time the killer had escaped i gathered from several days deciphering of the neue presse and from talk at the office that the police s assumption was that von siedelheim had been murdered by crackpot revolutionary elements who saw new economic ties between germany and liberia as a renewal of imperialist adventurism or perhaps by rightists who opposed german participation in the recently chartered common market of which the ecsc was a forerunner the theories made no sense to me at the time although such acts of political violence would become common in a few years with the arrival of the red brigade and groups on the right what jolted me instead was the rank senselessness of the act it was von siedelheim s first return to germany in seven years in an odd way the murder epitomized the feeling we all had then of living on the edge of an abyss that was literally true in germany with divisions of soviet tanks poised to strike at any moment igniting armageddon but the feared violence of the cold war could be denoted by nothing so rational as the later political radicalism f kind of moral anarchy had come to undergird the east west standoff even if we could not openly see it as such if there was a car wreck i realized the police would call the school i went to the foyer to the telephone and checking the list that mandy my secretary had typed and taped into cellophane nearly nine months before i found the number of the hall phone in michael s dormitory when the operator came on i recited it for the odd blasting rings went on and on finally someone answered a boy whose accent dropped me back to mobile alabama where i d done navy boot camp as a twenty year old more than twenty years before i asked for michael montgomery the boy grunted and the phone clattered down i could picture the handset dropping slapping the wall at the end of its cord bright noises in the echo chamber of the corridor made me see a rough game of keepaway at last yet another boy new jersey came on the line to say that montgomery was a fiver as if that explained everything i knew that about half of the dormitory students who were themselves a minority in the school were five day boarders routinely going home on fridays to american posts bases and stations within a couple of hours of wiesbaden i asked the boy if he was sure michael montgomery was not there he said yes and was about to hang up i declared he went to check again leaving the phone to bang against the wall after another few minutes he returned to say that michael was nowhere a that if he d stayed over they would have seen him in the caf at dinner but nobody had i asked if there was a dance that night or a big game the next day and took what i needed from his answer that he did nt know i hung up before he did where are you once at our place in the adirondacks michael and i stayed up late into the night sitting on the
emotion literally moved me excited my mind and spirit set my body parts dancing a language half understood brimming with much more than i could comprehend but a language addressed to me language belonging to me because it described me even when i did nt know exactly what a beat or rhythm or deep bass riff or falsetto trill were saying i was seized i could recognize what amounted to ideas sam cooke and the soul stirrers or the swan silvertones or dixie hummingbirds or hank ballard and the midnighters though i couldnt translate the lucid shimmering counterpoint of quartet close harmony into words part of the magic the freedom of music meant that i did nt need to turn it into words and i guess i was lucky or smart because i did nt try to translate music escaped the net of familiar everyday language the official standard register of speech the standardized sound and sense that too regularly felt as if they werent addressed to me did nt belong to me in various degrees homewood folks resisted the dominant vernacular of the language our speech played against it or you could say fought since our ways of talking were intended to detoxify certain features of the common language we felt unfairly raised some people not us up because they pronounced particular words in a specific fashion people who to our ears flattened depersonalized the rhythm of their english decorated the pronunciation of individual words who foregrounded the musical possibilities of their talk speakers for whom cadence repetition tone beat metaphor silence expressed a range of meanings and messages others might pursue by expanding and elaborating their vocabularies the dominant language culture disrespected us employed the arbitrary authority of its speech habits to mock our culturally inherited difference music assured me there was more out there to experience than a world already wrapped up tight in somebody elses words words tangling me up in them while they also perversely excluded me long before i met caliban i experienced his ambivalence toward prosperos tongue good african american music said once upon a time id been fluent in tongues the music spoke and becoming an adult would surely involve relearning needing to master these tongues again music promised more it named me stole my name changed the names of familiar things around me imbued ordinary situations with drama the way hollywood soundtracks pump up the ante of mundane scenes transcendent is capacity of music to expand the parameters of experience upward elevating the spirit extending the range of whats possible music ushers in a transcendent reality yes it did and does rise did inform my spirit but musics messages just as consistently took dead aim at my flesh penetrated down to the bodys visceral core even gospel with its drumbeat and holler and dance roots worked down to the gut groin ground transcendent okay but better to say music opened me up and down and all around many years after leaving homewood i encountered a byzantine icon in a cypriot church a portrait of an angel with eyes all over eyes on bosom chin wings hands arms hundreds of all seeing eyes eyes all seen once the artist painted his vision pierced and transfigured by light light entering light going forth from the angels eyes a nimbus of light crowning her and i think thats a picture of how music transformed me as own songs no not transformed or transfigured those ideas a little too easy just like the angel pictures a little too pretty but im working working to help you see what i mean because that helps me see better more were still on the more music said theres much more to life than meets the eye and said you were born with a gift a faculty something like an eye or ear and if you learn how to make it pay attention it will reveal much more about the more there is to life the more there is to you youll become different you are different when you pay attention everythings larger than if you do nt today i say to myself a gift was planted long long ago deep inside the music by wise people wishing the best for you wishing something extra for you transfiguration transformation more for you infused in african american music by beleaguered people who foresaw your coming and understood how desperately youd need what theyd sown themselves out to save themselves music tattooing invisible markings on their skin like those electronic dots stamped on your palm unseeable except in a beam of infrared light you must pass your hand through before exiting from the prison visiting room hands clapping feet stomping a sway beat and keening moan tribal markings aglow when the musics present identifying your ancestors to each other to you and yours in a vicious world that strips you and mocks your nakedness african people who honored something precious in themselves worth too much to let anybody crush and found a means to pass on this knowledge this more this other inalienable part of themselves in the songs they sang the rhythms thumped on drums or flesh with hands sticks feet the whole bodys bump and glide lift and fall through air finally along with the music also coming before and informing hoop there were stories they were out there an oral history so to speak mouth somebodys ear staying alive the thing was since they were out there being told and retold you did nt have to think about them like money in the bank you could count on them there when you needed them all kinds of stories for different occasions to be told in particular places at particular times and as i hung around the court more and more i heard the ball playing ones about hoop about the playground game i can look back and say yes its something i truly loved one of the few
little creole friend eugene why you choose dillard ayanna pressed her bridget snapped does it matter would you be better off if you never met me ayanna thought about it and came out grinning nah girl you my dog i m glad you came here she responded with a chuckle bridget said and i m not your dog ayanna i m your girl that sounds a lot better to me stop talking like these rapper guys so much and stop sweating eugene too she added you act like you re jealous ayanna denied it she said leslie smiled at it ayanna was lying she was jealous of eugene secretly leslie figured that ayanna wanted her own light skinned wavy haired friend ayanna wanted more than what she felt she deserved and she envied bridget for going for it leslie even wondered if her houston friend would fall for her older brother pierre he did nt have the light skin but he had the dark wavy hair a head full of it yula looked at bridget and frowned at her choice of words she joked you re her girl bridget ayanna caught on to it and started laughing oh i do nt get down like that i got ta have the wood after the tongue the real wood leslie laughed and shook her head ayanna was a trifling fool but she was harmless as long as you never took her too seriously however the self assured remarks from bridget kept leslie on her guard joke or no joke bridget in her wealth leslie envied that security she had toiled every single day of her life to earn any and every thing that she had and it was never secure yula coveted bridget s slim trim waistline although she would never admit it yula had learned to live with what size she was given so they all envied bridget bridget could afford to be confident and optimistic she was rich beyond income she was rich in mind body and in spirit the most important wealth anyway bridget told them i m glad that we re all here with nowhere to go tonight because i always wanted to play this thing with you guys she stood and rushed over to the coat closet she pulled out a white bag from the bottom and hurried back to the dining room table tugging out a brand new ouija board yula took one look at it and said i know that ai nt what i think it is yeah it s a wee gee board she confirmed ayanna grinned and said every time i see that word i think how come it s not pronounced ou jah board or just spelled differently leslie smiled and said o u i is pronounced we in french and it means yes and ja or gee spelled j e u means like a game so it basically means a yes game or an answer board she began to clear their plates from the table and added it s like witchcraft where you call out the spirits for answers is it anything like voodoo ayanna asked yula looked back and forth at them with large eyes leslie continued to smile while shaking her head i do nt know why you keep asking me about voodoo i do nt know much about that you probably know more than i do as much as you like to talk about it that s all ayanna explained and with you being from new orleans and knowing french and creole and everything i just figured that you would know leslie shook her head well i do nt she had often asked her father about voodoo as a child out of her own curiosity and her father would never talk about it but she had never asked her mother bridget asked them all so is everyone willing to play it it was slightly after eight o clock leslie nodded her head and grabbed the last of the food to put away i m willing she said moving swiftly to the kitchen ayanna said yeah count me in girl but yula was uninterested and that was an understatement she said aw hell naw i m not playing that shit hell no she hollered bridget opened up the box over the dining room table fun yula shut her eyes and refused to even look at the game ayanna said oh shit you got a glow in the dark one bridget said i figured it would be more fun to play it in the dark yula started to get up and walk off with her eyes still closed in the kitchen leslie shoved the leftover food into the refrigerator and tossed the dirty plates into soapy water in the sink to wash later she began to pray that the phone did nt ring she even thought of ignoring it if it did she had some serious questions to ask the spirit world she had never come face to face with an actual ouija board before she had only heard and read about it along with palm readings numerology tarot cards and everything else that was deemed mystical including the often talked about voodoo ayanna tried to keep yula from leaving the room as bridget read the instructions come on yula stop that shit ai nt real ayanna insisted while yanking yula s arm leslie sat and helped bridget with the instructions while picking up the message indicator a raised triangular shaped pointer with an open eye at the center the ouija board sat out under the dining room light to effect a strong glow while in the dark it was labeled with the twenty six letters of the english alphabet in a downward arc with the ten basic counting numbers from one to nine and then zero below above the alphabet and in opposite corners of the board were the answers yes and no and at the very bottom was
hostess i thought we might go riding like old times nick wore no emotion i ca nt sheridan i m working you call that work she laughed besides you re the boss you set your own hours sorry i ll have to take a rain check their gazes locked billie felt like an intruder finally sheridan dismounted and handed over her horse to a waiting groom she left without comment although billie sensed her anger boiling inside billie looked at nick and noted the strange twist to his lips are you laughing at me this is called a grimace nick demonstrated while he talked let s start with the basics now this is a saddle billie he was taking up his valuable time no telling what was going on back at the house and seeing sheridan again after all these months had left him shaken he had enough problems and billie pearce was only adding to them this is a stirrup mr kaharchek pay attention now you slide it up snug against the saddle like this this is a girth you unhitch the girth and the saddle slides off you can take the saddle pads off the horse at the same time he motioned for a stable hand lurking just inside the barn from the look on the kid s face bafflement and amusement he d witnessed the whole thing nick avoided eye contact instead he handed the saddle to the youth and in turn took a blue nylon halter from him he pulled billie toward zeke s head always leave the reins over the horse s neck while you re removing the bridle he placed her hand behind zeke s crown piece you gently slide it over the horse s ears and he paused when billie s face suddenly registered pain her face went white something wrong he sonmyfoot the dumb son of a horse is on my foot she tried to shove zeke but it was like trying to move mount everest tears smarted her eyes nick reacted quickly one firm touch and the big chestnut gelding calmly shifted away from billie she stared wide eyed at her brand new riding boot perfectly branded with the imprint of zeke s hoof she gasped in pain my foot is broken it s probably shattered she glared at the horse was she just imagining the smug expression she d seen that same look on sheridan flock s face you did that on purpose she accused she shot a glance at nick he obviously finds it amusing nick had to agree it did look as though zeke were smiling i ll signaled for the hovering boy to take zeke away and brush him down before putting him into his stall that s not a damn bit funny billie said as she watched the horse walk away with a jaunty sway of its hips if body language was anything to go by the animal clearly thought it was the victor in their little encounter as for her jaunty swaying was out of the question she could nt put any weight on her foot i ll never walk again she wailed mrs pearce please calm down nick sighed just when he thought things could nt get worse the woman was really hurt she d probably managed not to sign a release form and would likely sue the pants off him his insurance company would cancel his polo school would be history and she was hurt that was the worst part his protective instincts snapped alive her pretty eyes were swimming with tears she refused to shed belligerent set to her chin and decided she probably was brave even if it did nt look that way at the moment he scooped her into his arms and turned toward the barn her mouth popped open in surprise but he felt her arms circle around his neck as though she realized she had no choice she pressed against him for support just what he needed after having her fall full length against him coming in contact with him in all the right places he envisioned her children and their friends coming home at the end of the day to the smell of homemade cookies and tall glasses of milk he envied them wondered if they realized how lucky they were having been raised by one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the state he d had little opportunity for warm straight out of the oven cookies and cold milk billie shifted and the soft material of her tank top brushed against his bare arms she felt soft and curvy and feminine a nice contrast never be thin enough he owed zeke a nice red apple damn he had no business thinking how soft and warm billie pearce was she had room mother and pta spokesperson written all over her pretty face she would never consider a three day weekend filled with sun fun and great sex she was different and she would nt appreciate knowing he was aroused just thinking about her inside the barn nick plunked her down on a bench how does it feel smushed smushed lord she was talking like her sixth graders how do you think it feels she snapped it feels like a horse crushed it to smithereens we have to get the boot off oh no you do nt not without ordering me a morphine drip he almost smiled mrs pearce i need to examine your foot that means i have to pull off the boot me drawn and quartered billie sucked in her breath and gripped the bench as he gingerly worked the boot off her injured foot she closed her eyes trying to remember the breathing techniques she d learned in lamaze class years before as she prepared for labor and delivery when her children were born she took a deep cleansing breath and concentrated on the top of nick s head she wanted to touch
but he had confidence and his stories were eventful and closely detailed most of the work in troubadour suffered from generality the more general the more universalthat seemed to be the guiding principle bill s talent was particularity how the snow creaked underfoot on a very cold clear day or what the low white sun looked like through a tangle of black branches the tackiness of a just oiled rifle stock the tearing sound of a bored fire everything in his work was particular and true except the people that hurt the longer pieces but in bill s shortest most implicit stories and in his occasional poems the exactitude and poise of his writing could carry you away he had me worried so did jeff purcell known as little jeff because we had another jeff purcell in our class his cousinbig jeff in fact little jeff was nt little and big jeff was nt big just bigger than little jeff who resented big jeff partly no doubt for inadvertently imposing this odious nickname on him little jeff was a friend of mine so like his other friends i called him purcell purcell habitually kept his arms folded across his chest like a civil war general in a daguerrotype this bellicose pose suited him under his bristling crew cut he cultivated a sulfurous gift for invective and contempt he was the herod of our editorial sessions poised to strike down every innocent who presumed to offer us a aesthetic purcell even flouted the timeless protocol of pretending to admire the work of his fellow editors at one of our meetings he declared that a story of mine called suicide note read as if it d been written after the narrator blew his brains out purcell came from a rich social family but you would nt have guessed it from his stories and poems or maybe you would his subject was the injustice of relations between high and low he had written a ballad about a miner being sent deep into the earth to perish in a cave in while the mine owner hand feeds filet mignon to his hunting dogs cooing to them in baby talk and his last troubadour piece was an epistolary story in which a general writes congratulatory letters to various grieving women after getting their husbands and sons slaughtered you may rejoice for your fallen hero knowing that his heart was perforated for our glorious cause and you and your little ones can rest assured that his missing head wherever it may radiant memories of the homeland for which he died so eagerly this story was i felt sure inspired by a certain passage in a farewell to arms but when it came up for consideration i bit my tongue and let it go it was nt bad cartoonish of course like all of purcell s work lurid and overwrought to be sure but venomously alive anyway i myself was in debt to hemingway up to my ears so was bill we even talked like hemingway characters though in travesty as if to deny our discipleship that is your bed and it is a good bed and you must make it and you must make it well or today is the day of meatloaf the meatloaf is swell it is swell but when it is gone the not having meatloaf will be tragic and the meatloaf man will not come anymore all of us owed someone hemingway or cummings or kerouacor all of them and more we surely there because imitation was the only charge we never brought against the submissions we mocked so cruelly there was no profit in it once crystallized consciousness of influence would have doomed the collective and necessary fantasy that our work was purely our own even purcell kept mum on that subject he was a threat his attack was broad even crude but you could feel his discomfort with the cushion he d been born on and his fear that it would turn him into one of the fatuous bloodsuckers he wrote about if he humanized his targets muted his voice used a knife instead of a cudgel yet he did nt necessarily have to do any of that in a field of stiffs one of his cartoons could win for simply being alive these then were the boys who stood between me and robert frost of course there were other self confessed writers in my form but i d read their english papers and troubadour submissions and seen nothing why did so many of us want to be writers it seemed unreasonable but there were reasons the atmosphere of our school crackled with sexual static we had the occasional dance with miss cobb s academy and a few other girls schools but these brief affairs only cranked up the charge and though from day to day we saw the master s wives roberta ramsey alone had the goods to enter our dreams the absence of an actual girl to compete for meant that every other prize became feminized for honors in sport scholarship music and writing we cracked our heads together like mountain rams and to make your mark as a writer was equal as proof of puissance to a brilliant season on the gridiron this aspect of my ambition was obscure to me at the time but there was another that i did recognize though vaguely and almost in spite of myself the problem of class our school was proud of its hierarchy of character and deeds work outside and that it would wean us from habits of undue pride and deference this was a good dream and we tried to live it out even while knowing that we were actors in a play and that outside the theater was a world we would have to reckon with when the curtain closed and the doors were flung open class was a fact not just the clothes a boy wore
all the old furnishings and antiques like someone lovingly looking at religious icons in a church i was sure any other child would have been bored but not baby celeste her patience amazed me mama of course was not surprised by baby celeste s behavior at all she believed baby celeste was the true heir of all the family s spiritual powers she ll had told me do nt just stand there looking stupid noble she snapped at me now i told you the woman is on her way here she could be coming down the driveway any moment hurry okay mama i scooped up baby celeste the gravity and criticality mama had whenever she wanted baby celeste hidden away frightened me i had nightmares of her being discovered and then taken from us for one reason or another after all what sort of people keep a baby hidden from the world where did the baby come from anyway they d wonder why was her hair being dyed if i expressed my fear about this mama would shake her head at me as if i were too stupid to ever know anything do nt you understand that they would never let that happen noble she asked i would have thought you did by now the they in our lives were the in and out watching over us always i did nt disbelieve her i had seen the way they looked at us and watched over us warning mama of things from time to time the way baby celeste looked in the direction of a family soul and the way her eyes grew small and interested convinced me she had already crossed over perhaps mama was right about her perhaps she came directly from them and did nt need to cross she was never away from them birth had simply been another doorway in the spiritual world for her and not as it was for the rest of us a doorway to a lesser place making it necessary for us to find our own way back up we go i sang and ascended the stairs baby celeste smiled at me and lay her head on my shoulder i kissed her little forehead and brushed back her hair how could anyone who saw us together not know instantly she was my child and that was why she grimaced whenever i did show baby celeste too much affection you can love her but as a brother would love a sister as a sister she would constantly remind me baby celeste was truly locked away in the world mama envisioned for us i wondered how being so confined so isolated would effect baby celeste how long could it go on when would it end or would it never end rarely feeling the sunlight on her face rarely smelling the aroma of spring flowers hardly ever luxuriating in the soft touch of the breeze baby celeste would surely be disadvantaged in ways i could nt imagine and yet when i sat with her in the turret and listened to mama and her customer s muffled voices below i realized how similar my plight was to my baby s was nt i as trapped and shut away in the prison of noble s identity rarely did i look out as i would if i were as distant to me as playing and being in daylight was to baby celeste we re alike in so many ways celeste i told her whispered to her while we waited in the turret room she glanced at me the tiny dimple in her cheek flashing like a small christmas light as she tightened those sweet small lips often when she looked at me or listened to me she seemed so much older she wore the face of someone who understood things far beyond her years and then an instant later she was baby celeste again laughing and giggling at the most insignificant little things a ray of sunshine trapped the floating dust and she marveled at the way the particles glittered she reached out to touch them and then laughed and looked at me to see if i had the same wonder i smiled a long time ago so many things were full of wonder for me stuck in the dark places now i closed my eyes stepping too far to the left or too far to the right nothing frightened me as much as disappointing mama more often than ever these days she made me feel it was only the three of us floating on some raft in a sea of turmoil we needed each other we had to keep our world tightly guarded behind tall thick protective walls it was only then that we would be safe baby celeste played quietly with one of her dolls while we waited shortly after baby celeste had been born mama had brought out the dolls mr taylor kotes the owner of the biggest lumber company in the community had given to me he had courted mama after daddy s death and there was a time i thought he would become our new daddy but he was killed in a terrible car accident when a drunken teenager in a truck rammed into him on his way home from our house i had really begun to like him too even noble had started to accept him his death reinforced some of the rumors about mama especially because mr kotes s sister spread them back then she had people believing that anyone who got too close to us was in some sort of danger mama was beautiful and still striking she could have had one man after another romancing her but she did nt seem to mind our isolation in fact she welcomed it especially after my supposed kidnapping being a former schoolteacher she continued my homeschooling back in those days i could count on the fingers of one hand how many visitors we
to with you amy made a face she d been watching movie stars kiss her whole life and had wanted to be on the receiving end of one of those romantic embraces but his tongue in her mouth if you do nt like it come on amy take a chance for once do nt be such a scaredy cat it was the name calling that made her take the risk scaredy cat she was nt ever going to be afraid like her mother all right she told him go ahead but if i do nt like it i ll stop he promised her his thumb caught on the pulse at her throat and she knew he must have felt it racing he grinned then said here goes nothing she closed her eyes and waited she felt something wet on her lips and jerked backward i have nt done anything yet he protested come back here she closed her eyes again and forced herself to relax this time she let herself enjoy the feel of his soft wet tongue caressing her closed lips from one side to the other to her surprise her body quivered luke slid your hands around my neck she obeyed him sliding her arms up around his neck and into his hair that brought her small breasts into contact with his chest which was surprisingly muscular he lowered his head again his mouth closing over hers his tongue gently seeking entrance probing at the seam of her lips you have to open up for me baby he murmured amy sighed in resignation and barely parted her lips she felt his tongue slide into her mouth and recede and felt another surprising quiver of excitement her hands tightened around his neck and she leaned her body against his waiting for the next intrusion she could feel the texture of his tongue and taste him he tasted good like buttery popcorn and coke amy had an analytical mind and she wanted to dissect the experience but she was starting to feel things she d never felt heat and need and desire his tongue was moving in and out lip and then receding she sucked on it to keep it where it was and heard luke gasp they broke the kiss and stared at one another with glazed eyes what s wrong she said what did you do i do nt know you sucked on my tongue he accused i m sorry no it felt good do it again before she could protest he was kissing her again his tongue in her mouth and she sucked on it like she had before and felt his body tense beneath her hands he broke the kiss again and laid his brow against hers oh god amy does this feel as good to you as it does to me in response amy simply caught him by the ears and pulled his head down to kiss him she found his lips closed and ran her tongue along the seam as he it was almost a sound of pain but she knew she was nt hurting him she pressed her tongue against his lips seeking entrance and he opened to her amy s tongue slid inside his mouth and he clasped her tight his tongue dueling with hers as they each sought to pleasure the other they were both breathing hard by the time they broke the kiss amy s knees were threatening to buckle again and her breasts ached we better stop this she said why luke said you like it do nt you that s not the point that s precisely the point luke said if it feels good do it some people have to think of consequences amy said to hell with consequences luke said reaching for her amy broke free if you want to be my boyfriend luke creed you will learn does that mean you re going to be my girlfriend amy realized what she d done partnered up with someone wild and irresponsible someone who flouted the rules at every turn it sounded wonderful yes she said it does she d kissed him again and used her tongue and enjoyed every long delicious minute of it they d spent the next four years as inseparable companions but they d never consummated the relationship until prom night the mare had slowed and amy realized the animal was laboring to breathe and reined her to a stop she felt as enervated as the mare who stood on shaky legs waiting for amy to direct her where to go amy slid out of the saddle and leaned against the mare feeling the tears sting her nose and well in her eyes god she was such a fool she d wanted someone responsible someone reliable someone she could count on to stand by her luke would never be that man so she d married carl nash and stayed with him for eleven long years as much a captive as her mother had ever been her marriage had ended a year ago she was free back in bitter creek to visit her parents her mother who still lived within the same four walls and her father who still patiently pitied her amy s blond hair was too short for a ponytail these days and she pulled off her stetson and set it on the saddle horn then lifted the hair off her nape with both hands so the breeze could reach the sweat and cool her she was standing like that eyes closed when she heard hoofbeats hey a voice called out to her i could nt believe my eyes it really is you amy felt her heart speed at the sight of luke it was as though her thoughts had conjured him she quickly dropped her hands and what a nice surprise she said with a smile she felt her smile widen and did nt try to stop it she was glad to
preface on the morning of september i was doing what i do as well as anyone i know that is not writing this is an enduring part of my daily routine something like the unbirth day party in through the looking glass unlike some of my colleaguesmainly the ones i do nt really care fori do not fly to my desk each morning with a full heart and a ready hand i skirt the perimeters of my home office with a sense of dread eyes averted from an empty computer screen instead of creation there is always procrastination the call to my closest friend to chew over the morning paper and to gossip which sometimes comes to the same thing the power walk in central park and the interlude at starbucksmy husband calls it four bucksand the triple venti no foam latte luckily the laundry room is five stories below my office or i could surely eke out another half hour folding sheets and t shirts several years ago my daughter downloaded a computer before i had used up all the demonstration games i played over and over in single minded pursuit of nothing more than a position on a scoreboard that only i ever saw and on which i was known as big mama eventually i deleted the program i had developed a terrible tetris problem a decade earlier that had enabled me to put off writing until well past a m and i could see which way things were headed i am a creature of habit it is all that allows me to write in the first place the routine designed to ward off the moment and then the moment itself when the first feeble sentence often merely a prelude to better things appears as my fingersplay word jazz on the keyboard what follows is usually a manic two or three hours fed by caffeine and the cd of the moment sondheim tori amos rosemary clooney james taylor alanis morissette i did not want to learn to type but the nuns insisted saying someday typed or be employed by a man who needed the same done to his business letters my fingers are the only sure handed things about me when i first sit down to write after all those years in newsrooms i am a very fast typist indeed as fast as any executive secretary but it was the variation from routine that enables me to remember that morning in particular remember it before it became the morning of the most important day in the history of the united states during my lifetime it was my eldest child s eighteenth birthday and that morning at breakfast his father and i had recalled with clarity and more than a little schmaltz the stiflingly hot morning when he had arrived limp and gray after a forceps delivery twelve days before we had left him at college for the first time and we were still smarting from the fissure in our family before we got into the car and drove away we reminded him yet again that when he turned eighteen he was obliged by law selective service neither of us felt any fear when we told him to do that it seemed almost quaint that particular demand at that moment in time from the two of us the former boy who had lived through the vietnam draft lottery the former girlfriend who had stood by breathless waiting for his number to come up the young couple exhaling in relief after if i had thought there was any chance my son would be forced to go to war i would have bought him a ticket to canada instead of driving him to connecticut there were two other reasons that i remember that morning so clearly as well the day before my daughter and i had attended the funeral of a family friend in pennsylvania and once i was done with my nonwriting rituals i intended to write about her about the considerable inspiration that the lives of valiant older people provide us i had gone straight from that funeral to a hospital where my closest friend was having cancer surgery surgery that have a great deal of trouble remembering almost anything at this moment in my lifewhile i once did a column tied to my age called life in the s i now say that the fifties version would be entitled where the hell did i leave my keys i do remember how i felt that particular morning as i settled into the old windsor chair at which i finally finished with preliminaries sat down to write i felt painfully mortal quite vulnerable and enormously grateful over the course of the next few days the entire city in which i work the entire country in which i live would come to feel much the same way for me there was a peculiar reason for gratitude as the horrible events of that day unspooled in a long endless loop of cataclysmic news footage when my husband called to tell me to turn on the television we both thought there had been a freak accident but as i watched the arc of that second plane as it south of our narrow victorian row house i knew that something uniquely terrible was taking place i also had reason to believe that everyone i cared for most was safe my husband across the hudson at his office the children at their schools my friend in the hospital across town it was difficult for us to talk to one another of course with the new york city telephone lines out the tunnels and bridges shut down and cyberspace hopelessly jammed one of the mementos i have kept from that morning are three identical e mails from our son at college who could not get through on the day of his birthday or for three days afterward each one is dated september and says in capital

splashing the surface susan screams and runs back to her bedroom b int susan s apartment bedroom the quilt to her chin a final retreat susan please stop it the splashing sounds in the kitchen continue

breathing of the helmet s occupant just over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a snap count we are in a crouch position looking downfield at the call of hike we and everyone on the field spring into action we sprint downfield the breathing becoming even louder a very big person still on the move we pan quickly around to look back for the quarterback barely visible among converging bodies he is releasing the football toward someone else easing up on the run we pan back around to look downfield just as the oncoming defender is upon us and crunch slams into us a strobing pan leaves us looking up at the sky our loud breathing has stopped after a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored inhale it continues irregularly another helmeted player appears above us to peer down into our helmet he extends a hand to help us up huddle we are looking back and forth around the circle at our gathered teammates quarterback delta thirty seven on four all with a simultaneous hand clap team huh line of scrimmage lined up opposite us is a snarling defender once again over loud breathing we can just hear the shouted count at hike we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging horrific close up he strains against us his animal gurgles of effort audible over our own ragged breath with a primal roar from the defenseman our pov tips back and up booming down to stop with a crunch against the ground staring up once again our breathing has stopped after a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming running back steps on us in his charge

crunch we are hit by the defender we once again land face up very steeply foreshortened right over us we see the defender juggling the live ball with a moan our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high distant defender he finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it and starts back upfield we climb wearily to our feet we look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone he pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us then resumes his strut the coach face twisted

he asked with the faintest edge in his voice all i want is an honest answer he sighed i love you jess you know that his face was a pale mask in the glare of oncoming headlights as a newsman jonathon dealt only with facts his biggest drawback was also his greatest asset he d never lie to her i ca nt make any promises i do nt know when or if i ll be ready for more than this we hardly see each other as it is she reminded him i know he said i wish it did nt have to be this way but my children come first for now at least jessie was doing her best to understand but right now she was too upset what would erin do she wondered but erin with her adoring husband and perfect child might as well be in a different universe how could she possibly know what it was like to have the man she loved slip through her fingers not that it was over she knew jonathon had been but was it enough she was nt sure how much longer she could stand being in limbo they drove in silence the rest of the way the rain had tapered off by the time jonathon pulled to a stop in front of her building a converted brownstone in chelsea on the corner of twentieth and ninth glancing up at the third floor to see her windows ablaze she realized that she d forgotten to turn out her lights as she was dashing out the door hours ago that seemed more like a lifetime damn as if her overdue con edison bill was nt already enough to bankrupt a third world nation more than most people paid in rent in her hometown of willow creek it served to remind her of her career slump which at the moment seemed to mirror the state of her love life see you tomorrow jonathon said hopefully i do nt know i m going to be pretty busy she hedged you he shut off the engine turning to regard her gravely mad no more like crushed what about tuesday then do nt you have therapy right i forgot tuesday evenings he and his ex wife and children had family therapy until she d started seeing jonathon jessie had nt even known there was such a thing postdivorce just as well she said airily i promised drew i d help him go over the photos for his show let jonathon wonder if her upstairs neighbor was more than just a good friend he took hold of her arm as she was climbing out of the car in the glare of a streetlamp through the rain dribbling down the windshield his face was cast in a queer undersea glow i m not saying it ll always be this way he said softly i just i want to be honest about where things stand she said in a low quivering voice i m not going to lie to you jess all right then since we re being so honest she said do nt count on me sticking around until you make up your mind unlike erin who never had any trouble speaking her mind jessie usually found it hard to express her feelings but this time the words came easily the hard part she knew would be following through he arched a brow is that an ultimatum no just the way it is with a sigh he let go of her arm look we re both tired can we talk about this tomorrow fine whatever she was getting out of the car when her foot bumped up against something on the floor the box of teuscher chocolates she d meant to give to his parents with the excruciating trip to rhinebeck snatched it up and tucked it under her arm just as well they did nt deserve it anyway dashing up the brownstone steps rain mingling with the tears that trickled down her cheeks she thought about erin the days when they d console each other with chocolate chip cookies and ice cream in times of heartbreak jessie could nt wait to call her just talking to her best friend would make her feel better erin s perfect marriage shimmered in her mind s eye the touchstone that had been a constant throughout her string of failed relationships reminding her that such happiness did exist that it was nt just in fairy tales though at the moment it seemed unlikely that she d ever find it jessie trudged up to the third floor to the lush strains of la bohme she was nt alone in her misery it seemed clive always listened to puccini when nursing a broken heart she unlocked the door to her apartment and before she was all the way inside meowing piteously jessie picked her up burying her face in delilah s thick black fur thinking at least someone s glad to see me glancing about she took in the marble fireplace and parquet floors the french windows that opened onto the street below telling herself how lucky she was to have this place that she could be living in a dump or one of those sterile high rises where you d get a nosebleed going up in the elevator but tonight there was no consoling herself even the homey touches the worn oriental rug the deep sofa with its scattering of bright throw cushions the fifties atomic lamp an oak bookcase displaying her collection of vintage nancy drew titles served only to remind her that she had no one to share it with she sank down on the sofa not even bothering to take off her coat which was probably ruined from the rain delilah leapt off her lap at once the only thing she hated more than being left box of chocolates and pried it open she was starving after having choked
sometimes the speakers seized the occasion to vent their own grievances they often identified the united states as the source of their personal troubles a college graduate of dark complexion even claimed to an audience of eight hundred that his health had been ruined by the american film industry because he had how to masturbate now he could nt control himself anymore he confessed publicly these kinds of condemnations high and low boosted the morale of the soldiers who grew restless eager to wipe out the enemy of the common people on the night of march we crossed the yalu every infantryman carried a submachine gun two hundred rounds of ammunition four grenades a canteen of water a pair of rubber sneakers and a short shovel on the back of his bedroll and a tubed sack of parched wheat flour weighing thirteen pounds we walked gingerly on the eastern bridge because the western one was partly damaged each man kept ten feet from the one in front of him the water below was dark hissing and plunging now and then someone would cry out his foot having fallen through a hole a tall mule drawing a cart got its hind leg stuck in a rift and could nt dislodge it no matter how madly the driver thrashed its it shook then keeled over and fell into the river together with the helpless animal there was a great splash followed by an elongated whirlpool in the shimmering current and then the entire load of medical supplies vanished having left behind our insignias and ids from now on we called ourselves the chinese people s volunteers this was to differentiate us from the army back home so that china nominally having not sent its regular troops to korea might avoid a full blown war with the united states we were ordered to reach within fourteen days a town called yichun very close to the thirty eighth parallel the distance was about four hundred miles and we would have to walk all the way it was early spring the air still chilly the roads were muddy soaked by thawing ice and snow hard for us to trudge through the divisional headquarters had two jeeps that transported the leaders and their staff sometimes the jeeps would drop off the officers and turn no longer march thanks to blisters on their feet i walked the whole time except for once when commissar pei wanted me to get on his jeep so that i could figure out the meaning of the english words on a folded handbill someone had picked up on the way it turned out to be the menu of a restaurant in seoul which must have served americans mainly because the menu was only in english i could nt understand all the words but could roughly describe the dishes and soups to pei shan the entrees included broiled flounder filet beef steak fried chicken meat loaf besides the commissar s orderly a clerical officer named chang ming who edited our division s bulletin often boarded the jeep i envied him for that whenever we stopped somewhere for the night chang ming would be busy interviewing people and writing articles commissar pei seemed a born optimist he often laughed heartily jutting his chin and showing his buckteeth he looked more like our division commander niu jinping was a wisp of a man who had once been the vice director of the political department of the sixty second army i often saw a cunning light in niu s round eyes in his presence i was always cautious about what i said when he smiled he seldom opened his lips chuckling through his nose as if his mouth were stuffed with food he was a chain smoker and his orderly carried a whole bag of brand name cigarettes for him both the commander and the commissar were in their early thirties and neither was experienced in directing battle operations back in dandong city i had nt been able to imagine the magnitude of the war s destruction now to my horror i saw that most villages east of the yalu lay in ruins the land looked empty with at least four fifths of the houses leveled to the ground the standing ones were mostly deserted most of the korean houses were shabby with thatched hip roofs and many of them were mere huts that had gaping holes as windows it must have been hard to farm this rugged land where boulders and rocks stuck out of the ground everywhere yet it seemed every scrap of tillable soil was used and even low hills were terraced with small patches of cropland we came across korean civilians from time to time most of them were in rags women in white dresses that had faded into yellow and old men wearing black top hats with chin straps reminding me of chinese men of ancient times here and there roads had been cratered and teams of chinese laborers were busy filling the holes carrying earth and stones with wicker baskets affixed to a frames the farther south we went the fewer houses remained intact and as a result most of us had to sleep in the open air generally during the day it was nt safe for us to march because american planes would come in droves to attack us so only after nightfall town the air raids were constant and sometimes even took place at night every infantryman carried at least sixty pounds while each horse was loaded with five times more without enough sleep and rest the troops were soon footsore and exhausted on the fifth day heavy rain set in and made it impossible for us to lie on the ground to sleep some officers in our political department clustered together with a piece of tarpaulin over their heads many men too tired to care about the downpour simply put their bedrolls on the ground sat on
and a blade of dread sliced through her heart she wanted to laugh at him to tell him he was addled call him a fool but she held her tongue did he not know who she was who her father was did he not heal her lame horse before she said another word he slipped away as if in his own mist through the curtain of rain overhead the wings of a great owl flapped wildly wait she cried but before the word was uttered she knew he was gone swallowing hard she clucked softly to the horse pulling on the reins as she led the beast back to the great gates of dwyrain the man was mad she told herself not to be trusted an imposter who performed some sort of trickery but no matter how desperately the premonition of doom that trailed after her as unshakable as her own shadow as dark as the deep waters of hag s end lake tower dwyrain winter come now smile megan t is your wedding day ewan cajoled lying on the bed in his chamber he patted the white fur coverlet and smiled up at his daughter even in the flickering light from the candles megan saw the spots of age on his thin skin and noticed that his once fleshy face had hollowed in his youth his eyes had been as clear and blue as a mountain lake but now they had clouded leaving him half blind you ll not have to look after me much longer child he told her my time here is short nay father she said closing the door behind her and hurrying to his bedside she sat on the edge of the feather mattress and took his cold fingers in her own see a grandson before i go a strong strapping lad as bevan was he said tears welled in megan s eyes when she thought of her brother a year older than she but now in his grave the victim of the sickness that had taken so many in the castle including her mother and tiny sister megan swallowed against a thick lump that had formed in her throat she d heard the gossip knew that most of the servants and a few of the knights blamed her for the death and destruction that had befallen dwyrain ever since she d seen the lame prophet in the forest and he d cursed her as well as the castle her father sighed sadly but ye d best not wait too long with that grandson do nt talk such madness she chided refusing to believe that her beloved father would soon die but t was as if he were deaf holt he will be a good husband to smiling without reason as if he had no mind left there was hushed talk between his men that he was addled that the loss of his wife and two children coupled with his age had finally caught up to him that he d taken one too many blows to the head in the heat of battle in his younger years a lucky lass ye be to marry a knight as brave as sir holt despair raked sharp claws down her heart nay father she said boldly knowing this was her last chance to change his mind do not argue with me grasping his hand more urgently she whispered but father i need not a husband shh he said then coughed loudly his chest rattling his body clenching against the pain god in heaven he growled once the attack had passed he reached for a mazer of wine on a bedside table his glared at megan menacingly as if she were the reason their master no longer rode wildly through the forests and underbrush drinking mead whooping loudly and flushing out deer boars and pheasant for them to chase beneath the dogs yellow eyed glare megan inched up her chin even the snarling beasts appeared to blame her for the ills that had plagued dwyrain ever since that crippled old sorcerer had sealed her doom with his prophecy and cayley whom megan had trusted with her secret had told the story of the curse but father she pressed on remember the magician said that should i marry this man of your choosing the marriage would be cursed and shh child i believe not in such devilment ewan grumbled bellowing as he once had only to end up in a deep bone jarring hack t is against the teachings of the church father timothy said t was a trick the cripple weak mind my mind is far from weak megan said quickly and silently cursed the priest for his false piety the man was too swift to point to the fault in others too hasty to give a tongue lashing too eager to see punishment meted out when none was needed unlike father andrew a kind and wise man who during his years as chapel priest at dwyrain had always seen both sides of a disagreement father timothy was young and all knowing with a glint of pleasure in his eye when anyone was caught in a sin t was as if he enjoyed watching others explain their sins and beg forgiveness aye i know you not to be thick skulled as father timothy proclaims but i can not believe in witchcraft and the dark arts what would your mother rest her soul think with a deft movement he crossed himself as he sometimes did when his thoughts turned to violet and her early death he d forgotten she d left this earth i know not well i ll ask her the next time she comes to visit he said and she looked for a hint of humor in his cloudy eyes but found none nay he believed that his wife though dead walked these halls and that she often carried baby rosalind with her or spoke of bevan you

bite and a big swig the sweet pulpy taste mixing into the glutinous sticky mouthful she did nt finish swallowing before taking another huge bite maybe i ll be a fat person in my new life she started to laugh and the peanut butter bread orange juice clump stuck momentarily in her throat cutting off her airway she imagined indifferently choking and dying in this motel room she swallowed and then laughed even harder out loud it sounded crazy her short sudden laugh against the quiet mono sound of the television she could hear her breath squeeze in and out of her lungs and throat she turned up the volume on the television and stared hard at it jim brown was talking to dick cavett brown wore a tight white jumpsuit with beige piping and a wide tan leather something out of oversized mugs also white and placed them on a mushroom shaped white metal table between them brown smiled handsomely and kept declaring with exquisite enunciation his respect and support for his friend the president a piece of lined paper in a spiral notebook a ballpoint pen karen black mary jo kopechne joni mitchell martha mitchell joan baez jane asher joan is nt so bad linda mccartney joan mccartney joan lennon oh good sure bobby would appreciate that she almost waited for him to contact her but she knew he would not not for a while anyway at eleven o clock she turned the channel to watch the news tried to see if he or any of them had been identified or arrested jane fonda phoebe caulfield valerie solanas she liked these names must nt reference her real name in any way brigitte hannah tricia just do nt get cute lady bird pat the suburbs you are freya from the edge bobby had said they sat cross legged on a handwoven rug bobby had bought in spain she spent many nights getting high kneeling on that rug she could examine it endlessly moorish mbius patterns took you in dervish circles back to where you started but done in incongruous rainy european colors muted greens and yellows next to imperial regal and regimental looking banners and shieldlike things the rug was nt authentic but whoever made it had worked meticulously to evoke something authentic studied relics of conquerings exiles and colonies it clashed and conflicted the way real things often did it was the most beautiful thing either of them possessed and they often sat on it next to their bed which was just a mattress on the floor with no frame or even box springs all the kids she knew slept on the floor it softened the distinction between their bed and the rest of the world she felt safer nearer to the people sit cross legged on the floor on beautiful rugs were there horizontal and vertical cultures was living closer to the earth free and natural or was it simply meager was it good or better or just different for someone and what will you call me she had asked leaning her head against his back he often wore sleeveless undershirts very thin and slightly ribbed when she pressed against him he smelled both tangy and sweet pot and incense and sweat she tried to conjure him with her eyes closed in her midnight bed she thought bobby looked exotic handsome not so much in the total as in the details the closer in she was the more attractive he became his skin had a faint yellow green undertone that was the opposite of ruddy skin so smooth under her touch that she could feel every tiny rough spot on her own fingers or lips skin so clear and fine she could see his blood pulse at wrist ever crazy about the random curliness of his long black hair which grew out rather than down she adored the silky way the hair slipped through her fingers when she pulled her hand through it and the tension in his shoulders when she pressed against them and how in candlelight she would see her white skin her slender hand say against the dark skin of his broad back and it would catch her off guard always the contrast between them she felt then exquisite and even fragile which she liked she was nt supposed to but she did perhaps because they spent so much time together and dressed alike and spoke alike even laughed alike it was great to in some palpable way be unalike will you call me mary at least when we are home in bed only freya and you have to call me marco in these sorts of activities you ca nt use your real name ever if you want to change your life nom de guerre is nt that sort of ridiculous all cultures have naming ceremonies you have a given name but then you get a chosen name it s part of a transformation to adulthood they tell you who you are and then you decide who you are it s like getting confirmed or getting married but i did nt choose that name you did i m helping you the first thing we do is make up a new name a fighting fearless name a bolshevik name mary said frowning it s a nordic goddess name a towering priestess name a lightning bolt name a name to live up to she closed her eyes and rested against him okay a name that exudes agitprop these are always two syllable names that end in a vowel freya maya silda marco proto demo if you do nt like never did use those names except in the press communiqus and on the telephone now she was choosing another name its opposite a hidden modest meek name but truly choosing the next morning was it morning when she woke after hardly sleeping she sat down in the one chair a molded plastic affair in mustard yellow next
dislike but there was going to be law and order on doyers street poor ah hoon did nt even want to do his act man he wanted to take the next train out of town but the cops and the on leong made him take the stage that night they had something to prove he did nt but he waited in the wings and sweated through the acrobats leaping over each other he agonized through the singer s songs trying to peer into the darkness to see where the bullet or knife or hatchet was going to come from he probably came close to having a heart attack every time the gas lamps sputtered and popped downstage but all the time the cops and the on leong men reassured him that all would be well he was protected he would live can you imagine anyone having a better reason to have stage fright than poor ah hoon he walked out onstage that night and the first person he saw front and center was mock duck grinning up at him but there were the american police to the left and right of his mortal enemy ah hoon took a and dove into his act he did nt change a word and by all accounts he was very very funny that night even mock duck laughed at the impersonation when it was time for the curtain call the police swept him offstage before his first bow and an encore was out of the question the point had been made ah hoon had survived the performance well the on leong men went wild that night fireworks exploded in the sky over chinatown their brightness dimmed somewhat by the eerie fog hip sing men were burned in effigy and humiliated in songs and jeers to the on leong men the survival of ah hoon had proven that the hip sing were no longer the threat they had once posed and that the war was won meanwhile the cops hustled ah hoon to a cheap room in a cheap hotel next to the theater they had rented it just to ensure that nothing would happen to tarnish their reputation as protectors of the weak and innocent everyone on the floor used the same washroom at the far end of the hall the other apartments along the hall had been cleared of occupants for the night did nt matter if they had paid in advance lived there for years or had no place else to go they were rousted there were no closets in the room but several small cupboards there was a bed there was one window but it had been jammed into a stuck position for years a two inch gap let a little air into the stuffy room but the window could be neither forced open wider nor lowered more three stories down was a dead end alleyway barely the width of a broad shouldered man three cops were positioned at its mouth preventing any entrance opposite the window about three feet away was the solid brick wall of a building that particular side was unmarred by a single door or window featureless and rising another four stories beyond ah hoon s floor cops on foot hotel ten officers stood in the hallway outside ah hoon s room a big swede cop of impeccable moral fiber at least of no discernible vice was placed before ah hoon s door an hour after sunrise the chief of police led a phalanx of reporters photographers reformers and politicians past the few remaining on leong revelers into the hotel up to the third floor down the line of ten cops standing at attention and up to the big swede the chief of police himself proudly opened the door to introduce ah hoon to the rest of his life and announce to the world that the resolve of the hip sing tong had been broken and that peace would reign forever and for all time in chinatown the bullet hole had made a perfect dot in the center of ah hoon s forehead giving the appearance of a third eye he sat cross legged on his bed stiff and cold in a pool of his own drying blood legend has it was the touch of a demon flies were already buzzing curiously about his head which faced the single window still opposite a solid brick wall still jammed at less than two inches open and as the chief of police roared his outrage and the flashbulbs popped and as the word spread through chinatown like a flash fire that the sweet flower war was over and the hip sing not the on leong had won and as an entirely new celebration began the wide eyed expression on ah hoon s face seemed to say one simple thing now that s funny gibson closed his fist around the tin stallion and reopened it it had vanished the winds changed that morning and after months of coldly clinging to every nail and stone and board the chinatown death cloud rolled back out to sea and vanished as completely as the life from ah hoon s body he closed his fingers into a fist again and then opened them suddenly a fresh cigarette two fingers a simple french drop with a flourish for dramatic punctuation his tale was told he inhaled the smoke deeply and waited for the reaction he could tell a lot about a fella by the way he reacted to a story or a magic trick they either bought it did nt or tried to find some little flaw that could let them feel like they had nt been conned into enjoying it when they really had he figured hubbard for the last type the cops were in on it gibson was right they were nt and you forgot what i asked in the first place he reminded hubbard the booze making him sound more arrogant than

the first entrance the third entrance technically the numbers are wrong as there is an entrance before the first entrance but for some reason no one counts this entrance the first entrance is where the oldest homes of little rocky run are and also the cheapest and smallest the fourth entrance contains the prefab quasi manors approaching the million dollar mark already in braddock park high

military are civilian contractors in the research of the design of weapons systems develop fuel cells and the technology of military action or they work for mobil in a middle management capacity

in the north of israel it is an extraordinary site megiddo is a hill that spans about fifteen acres made up of thirty cities built one on top of the other over six millennia beginning with the prepottery neolithic period nine thousand years ago the wrestlings of my own heart should be overshadowed in this valley of death at least thirty four nations have battled in this place with enormous slaughters this is where pharaoh thutmose iii fought the first battle known in recorded history anywhere in the world the author of the book of revelation predicted that in the end of days the battle between good and evil will ultimately take place here in fact the word armageddon is a corruption of the hebrew phrase har megiddo mount of megiddo modern israel is no stranger to conflict and one does nt have to dig to remember every weapon created has been wielded here and the newest generations biological and nuclear hang like damocles s sword over the young nation to stay ahead defense walls i ve spent my career here underground with the ancients without emerging much into today s headlines i ve been less interested in the political and religious conflict of any century and more interested in personal practice mostly studying middle bronze age mortuary practices in the past countless have lived thrived and then bled here until they became bone today millions come to visit including historic visits the first visit of a pope to israel took place here in megiddo two hundred professionals dig here every working day norris directs them all and i supervise twenty archaeologists and volunteers concentrating on the temples of stratum xv and the elaborate shaft tombs but each morning like this one there is just me the generations below me are silent and the tour buses have not yet rumbled in in the half light the site is empty i cross the museum parking lot and begin to climb the tell the land is perfectly still and mute secret gardens when i dig my callused hands into the cool predawn earth i feel all of her richness tingle through my skin before dawn the land always seems to yield hinting that with just the right touch everything dormant in her might awaken push through its black chambers and ezekiel s field of bones would drink the moist sky i walk through the remains of solomon s stables the rows of dark cold arches i imagine the din of whinnying and neighing echoing through the ancient hall sparse thorny grasses and sharp foliage poke through the stones as i emerge from the maze of stables the horizon wears a crown the sun is just rising i kneel beside my most recent project the three thousand and seventy second infant burial jar we ve unearthed i put down my knapsack and unroll my pack of tools a small pickax a toothbrush variously sized paintbrushes and fine dental tools the jar is shaped like a womb disappointing for them to be delivered not by some messiah to life everlasting but by me to a mention in my field notes i begin to gently dust the rim of the jar thinking it is hard for me to believe that i am thirty nine years old looking at the swollen shape of the jar i involuntarily draw my hand over my stomach i used to wonder what it would be like to be round and full like that instead of empty flat to carry life inside me i do nt think about it much anymore i have never gotten myself tested to see if i have the lou gehrig s gene like my father like my grandfather i tremble at the thought of bequeathing my fear to another if not my child then his or hers a damocles sword over all my generations and at the same time i sigh the sky that had sagged so sweetly as if the kingdom of heaven s doormat was just within thumbtack i labor over the jar and its crumbled contents you would be i d estimate three thousand years old today i say some scholars have written that these are the remains of child sacrifices from an ancient cult it s possible i shrug to myself infant mortality rates were astronomically high still are in many places i do nt know i say out loud to no one either way you probably were nt going to make it to your three thousandth birthday anyhow i begin to hear the buzz of insects as the sun climbs doing their jobs as well diggers are beginning to arrive soon my team will assemble and i ll direct them i pull out my notebook and lean in close to the jar sketching the details the early bird gets the urn eh i sit back norris is standing over me eclipsing the sun i squint a little he s my note he asks tilting his head i remember the crumpled page of my book tacked to the door and the plume of heat it fueled in me i used to stew over his mockery for days i wonder for a moment if the fact that i ve started to become used to it that i can recover so quickly is a bad sign a sign i ve accepted abuse as the norm it was nt always this way norris my professor of levantine archaeology at columbia had been a great supporter of my first book body of water body of air water and theology in ancient israel my second book up in smoke was based on my thesis a study of cultic theology and connections between altars found in israel especially at megiddo and altars found throughout the middle east tracing borrowed cultic practices throughout the region the new manuscript upon this altar was a follow up to up in smoke i did altars that i began to see them everywhere
mecca ad i was born in blood and its terrible taint would follow me all my life my mother umm ruman cried out in agony as the contractions increased in severity the midwife a stout woman from the tribe of bani nawfal named amal leaned closer to examine the pregnant woman s abdomen and then she saw it the line of blood that was running down her patient s thigh amal looked over to the young girl standing nervously to the side of the wooden birthing chair where her stepmother was struggling to bring forth life asma she said in a soft voice trying to mask the fear that was growing in her chest get your father your mother abdallah was no more than ten years old at the time and she paled at amal s words asma knew what they meant so did umm ruman i am dying umm ruman had known something was wrong the moment her water broke it had been dark and mottled with blood and the subsequent horror of the contractions was far beyond anything she had experienced at the birth of her son abdal kaaba so many years before at the age of thirty eight she had known that she was too old to bear another child safely and had greeted the news of her pregnancy with trepidation in the days of ignorance before the revelation perhaps she would have turned to amal or the other midwives of mecca for their secret draft that was said to poison the womb but the messenger of god had made it clear to his small band of followers that the life of a child was sacred despite the many pagan arab customs to the contrary she had sworn an oath of allegiance to his hand and she would not go against his teachings even if they meant her demise unlike most of her neighbors and friends still clinging to the old ways umm ruman that her child the first to be born into the new faith of islam might not survive to see the sunrise amal took her hand and squeezed it gently do not despair we will get through this together her voice was kind but umm ruman could see in the stern lines around her mouth that amal had reached her professional conclusion the end was nigh for mother and child umm ruman managed to turn her head to her stepdaughter asma who stood frozen at her side tears welling in her dark eyes go bring abu bakr to me she said her voice growing faint she stroked the girl s still plump cheeks if i die before you return tell him my last request was that the prophet pray at my funeral asma shook her head refusing to face that possibility you ca nt die i wo nt let you the girl was not them was as strong as that of any mother and daughter perhaps stronger for asma had chosen her over her actual mother qutaila who had refused to accept the new faith abu bakr had divorced his first wife for it was forbidden for a believer to share a bed with an idol worshiper the proud qutaila had left their home in a furious rage vowing to return to her tribe but asma had refused to go with her the girl had chosen the straight path the way of the messenger and her father abu bakr that had been three years ago and asma had not seen her mother since umm ruman had felt sorry for the abandoned child still too young to understand the enormity of her choice and had raised the girl as her own she wondered what would happen to asma once she was gone abu bakr would likely look for a new wife but there were only a handful of believers and the message was spreading pagan leaders of mecca learned the truth of what the prophet was teaching their wrath would be kindled and the tiny community the believers had founded in the shadows would be exposed and destroyed in all likelihood asma would be alone without any foster mother to guide her through the journey of womanhood the girl was past due for her cycles which usually began at the age of ten or eleven for those born under the harsh arabian sun the menstrual flow would erupt any day now but umm ruman would not be there to comfort her through the shock of first blood she ran her hand through asma s brown curls hoping to bequeath a soft memory with her touch that would comfort the child in the days to come and then a shock of pain tore through umm ruman s womb and she screamed asma broke free of her stepmother s grasp she fell back stumbling over one of the bricks that the midwife had placed at umm ruman s swollen feet for a salve to ease her patient s agony the girl turned and ran in search of her father umm ruman closed her eyes and said silent prayer even as her body burned from within as her uterus contracted with increasing urgency she could feel the baby shifting preparing to emerge into the world a process that in all likelihood would lead to her death and possibly the baby s as well it was the beginning of the end she thought sadly umm ruman was right but in ways she could not have expected my father abu bakr walked through the quiet streets of mecca his head bowed low his back hunched slightly as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders which of course it was tonight everything had changed and he needed to tell someone normally he would have gone straight home after emerging from the prophet s house as their dwellings were next door to each tonight he needed to take a walk and besides his wife had entered labor earlier that
he just cuts up sometime when it s payday you know that huh i hated his sarcasm and righteousness and wondered how anyone could be fool enough to sit in a church and listen to this man talk about the gospel he walked away from us stepping carefully over each row his starched overalls creasing neatly behind the knees billy was at the water can in the shade of the oaks with his back to mr willis and was just buttoning his shirt over his stomach when he heard or felt mr willis behind him lord god almighty you give me a start there preacher he said you know my rule billy if you mean chunking the mater i guess you got me mr willis reached out and took the bottle from under the flap of billy s shirt he unscrewed the cap and poured the wine opened and closed his hands in desperation oh sweet lord you do punish a man he said mr willis started walking toward his house at the far end of the field holding the bottle lightly with two fingers and swinging the last drops onto the ground then he stopped his back still turned toward us as though a thought were working itself toward completion in his head and came back to the water can with his gray eyes fixed benignly on billy haskel s face i ca nt pay a man for drinking in the field he said you had better go on home today i picked for you many a season preacher that s right and so you knew my rule this stuff s going to kill you one day and that s why i ca nt pay you while you do it billy swallowed and shook his head he needed the work in front of the rest of us then he blinked his eyes and blew his breath up into his face well like they say i was looking for a job when i found this one he said i ll get my brother to drive me out this afternoon for my check he walked to the blacktop and i watched him grow smaller in the distant pools of heat that shimmered on the tar surfacing then he walked over a rise between two cornfields and was gone that s my fault juanita said he would have fired him anyway i ve seen him do it to people before no he stopped and came back because he was thinking of what i said he could nt have gone to his house without showing us something you do nt know mr willis he wo nt pay billy for today and that s one day s wage he s answer and i knew that she was nt going to talk the rest of the afternoon i wanted to do something awful to mr willis at five o clock we lined up by the bus to be paid clouds had moved across the sun and the breeze was cool off the river in the shadow of the bus the sweat dried on our faces and left lines in the dust film like brown worms billy s brother came out in a pickup truck to get billy s check i was right about mr willis he did nt pay billy for that day the brother started to argue then gave it up and said i reckon the sun would come up green if you did nt try to sharp him preacher juanita was standing in front of me she had taken her bandanna down and her indian hair fell on her shoulders like flat star points she began pushing it away from the nape of her neck until it lay evenly across brush right into her rump i had to bite my teeth at the quiver that went through my loins do you want to go to the root beer place on the highway i said i never go there so tonight s a good time to start all right that easy i thought why did nt i do it before but maybe i knew and if i did nt mr willis was just about to tell me after he gave me my check he asked me to walk to his car with him before i got on the bus during the summer a boy can get away from his regular friends and make other friends that do nt have anything to do with his life do you know what i mean he said maybe i do nt want to know what you mean mr willis your father is a university teacher doing my face felt dead and flat as though it had been stung with his open hand i m not going to talk with you anymore i m going to get on the bus now i said all right but you remember this hack a redbird does nt sit on a blackbird s nest i stepped onto the bus and pulled the folding doors closed behind me mr willis s face slipped by the windows as we headed down the dusty lane somebody was already sitting next to juanita and i was glad because i was so angry i could nt have talked to anyone we got to the produce market in yoakum juanita gave me her address a street name belonging to a vague part of town with clapboard houses and dirt yards and i drove uncle sidney s pickup out to his house in the country my mother was dead and my father was teaching southern history for the lived with my uncle sidney he raised tomatoes melons beans corn and squash and anything he planted grew better and bigger than any other crop in the county he always had the fattest turkeys and best fed angus and brahmas and each year his preserves won a couple of prizes at the county fair but he was also the most profane man
catches himself sorry congressman grayson is such a close friend of mine i m so happy that it all worked out he grins and allows me to recognize that i m indebted to him for my current state of employment which indeed i am three months ago between driving my mother to therapist appointments to the pharmacy and to neiman marcus i slowly and then instantly lost grip on my own sanity and then finally after ten months there was that night with the pot and the broken wrist and jack white and i finally broke down and explained to my mother that i d be leaving california that i was too young that it was too early for me to be playing nurse in a convalescent home for one against her best wishes she understood she had to so we made an arrangement with my aunt and i began for penn i had majored in political science and french literature and while the latter captured a greater portion of my interests in depth knowledge of camus while impressive at ivy league reunions and un receptions neither of which i ve attended is not exactly a marketable trait on the job market so i brushed off this unopened copy of the federalist papers that had been assigned reading in at least six classes and set my sights on washington it d be good i thought rewarding an exercise in service and duty i called chase the next day asked if his father had any connections a pointless query but a formality nonetheless and precisely thirty minutes later i had a job with congressman john grayson of california s forty first congressional district they say that good timing is everything and indeed it is because an assistant legislative aide was going to be attending law school in the fall and had decided to spend the remainder of her free life teaching art did nt care about the details as he excitedly relayed the news to me over the phone on a warm february morning i would no longer be driving ms mark and what a coincidence that congressman grayson represents your district back in california eh i nod and say yes yes it s wonderful really wonderful but silently i m thinking how truthfully it s not such a mind blowing convergence of events that really kip is close friends with the entire republican caucus yes sir i say and take a sip of the champagne i m very excited for the opportunity enough with the sir nonsense the king pats me on the back again you re like a second son to me like a second son two hours later and my blood alcohol content levels have elevated from officially wasted to lethally toxic and i m sitting indian style sun s beating down relentlessly on the back of my neck causing the alcohol to boil and simmer and thin in my veins i pick methodically at the green blades which is truly the only action that seems to suppress the mixture of champagne and gin and bile that s mixing in the back of my throat and moscow was absolutely gorgeous which i did nt really expect from a country that used to be communist i have no idea where this girl has come from nor an inclination why she thinks i m in any mental state to hear about whatever time she s spent in the former soviet union it s just a fantastic opportunity doing advance for the vice president if i could just get my hands on some water i think that d help and where has chase gone what people do nt realize about cheney is that he s really like a big teddy bear a great big teddy bear he loves to give paternal is the word she keeps using yeah i really get that vibe and annalee where s annalee he did nt mean to shoot that friend of his mr whittington just got in the way of dick s gun i mean christ she lights a cigarette it was an honest mistake really so i say tired of hearing about the vice president s honest mistakes with guns and lawyers how do you know chase chazy god i ve known him forever and i m suddenly sorry i ve asked kip and daddy both worked for exxonmobil in government relations at the same time then kip left to start lsh and daddy stayed on board with exxon chase went to st alban s and i went to the national cathedral school you ve heard of ncs right i was two years above him he dated friends when we were in high school and then of course he went to penn she gives me a nod and i went to princeton but we just stayed the absolute best of friends she stops abruptly i m surprised he never mentioned me to you but i m not in the mood to hurt any feelings so i assure her that it s likely he did and that i d just forgotten so many names you know oh i know exactly what you mean just the other day i was at this happy hour at daily grill that was arranged by princeton s d c alumni association and i was utterly appalled at how many names i d forgotten in a span of three years i mean d c is small and all but you really do nt run into as many people as you think you would i suppose it s a matter of i cut her off and ask her if she knew my the year before her nathaniel what s your last name mark nathaniel mark hmm was he in an eating club she stops and feigns embarrassment ugh i absolutely despise asking that about people was he in an eating club it s just so juvenile and faux pretentious the girl s
